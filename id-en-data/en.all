Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani Indrawati said that a sharp correction of the composite inde x by up to 4 pct in Wedenesday?s trading was a mere temporary effect of regional factors like decline in plantation commodity prices and the financial crisis in Thailand.
In a press briefing held at the ministry here on Wedenesday evening, Minister Sri Mulyani flanked by President Director of the Jakarta Stock Exchange JSX Erry Firmansyah said that some of the Indonesian economic factors had improved, instead the inflation factor of foodstuffs will soon dissappear which is confirmed by rice prices in all the provinces.
Sri Mulayani showed other factors, among others, the rupiah currency tended to strengthen, with a positive impact on the inflation.
This also happened to fuel oil prices.
The 2007 state budget is so far in a good condition and the government would continue implementing sound policies to create consistency which encouraged investors.
The ministry?s data also showed non resident investors? net buying of state bonds had reached Rp20.3 trillion from Rp 4.2 trillion in early 2006.
Meanwhile non resindent investors? net buying of shares had reached Rp17.3 trillion from Rp2.1 trillion in early 2006.
If you ask if it is right or not, I can say it?s fine and they do not abandon the country,? the minister said.
In the real sector, the government has issued regulation PP No 1/2007 as a revision of PP 148 on income tax facility for investment in certain regions or in remote areas.

PT Astra Agro Lestari's AALI's crude palm oil production in October 2007 increased by 11.6 percent to 88,343 tons from 79,161 tons in September, a company executive said here Monday.
AALI Director Santoso in his report to the Jakarta Stock Exchange said the increase was attributed to enough rainfall in the country.

Bank Indonesia BI has predicted that banking credit in 2008 will grow over that of this year which is targeted at 22 percent.
I think the banking credit next year will grow higher than this year which is targeted at 22 percent
He said records showed that banking credit up to the last week of September this year had almost reached 23 percent.
The increasing growth of credit is in line with prediction that the country's macro economy and national bank performance would improve, he said.
On the fundamental basis, our banks have become stronger as we could see that the US sub prime mortgage crisis did not affect them seriously, he said.
He said that banks in the country were able to cover their losses using market mechanism approaches.
This shows that the system has been running well. 
Therefore, Indonesia's economic expansion would be faster and credit provision would grow higher, he added.
On the fear that the high credit provision would pose a bad credit threat to the banking sector, he said that banks had better resilience nowadays.
The central bank's control over banks' risk management and good corporate governance is tighter, he said.

The ambassador made the appeal when he received executives of the Landon branch of ICMI on Monday in connection with the association's plan to hold a workshop on The Nation's Economic Representatives here on July 8, 2007.
Natalegawa said there were many opportunities the London branch of ICMI could use to help Indonesian businessmen in expanding their business to Britain.
He said Indonesia and Britain had had bilateral ties since 1967 when British investment in Indonesia reached an amount second only to Japanese investment.
On the other hand, there were only a small number of Indonesian businessmen who had expanded their business to Britain.
This constituted an opportunity for ICMI to help Indonesian businessmen to do business in the United Kingdom.
Let's invest in and export Indonesia's primary products to Britain, he added.
In the meantime, ICMI chairman for London Muslimin Anwar said Indonesian-British trade relations had developed in an encouraging way of late.

Foreign investment in Malaysia in 2006 is five times that in Indonesia, apparently because the more advanced economic development in that country was more attractive to foreign investors. 
Daily Utusan Malaysia here reported on Wednesday that the total investment in Malaysia in 2006 had reached 20.2 billion Malaysian ringgit US$5.6 billion, while that in Indonesia only stood at 4.7 billion Malaysian ringgit US$1.3 billion. 
A spokesman for the Malaysian parliament for trade and industry affairs, Dr Tan Yee Kew said that Malaysia ranked second after Singapore in ASEAN in terms of foreign investment.
Singapore managed to attract 30 billion Malaysian ringgit US$8.3 billion in foreign investment. 
In the meantime, the third position went to Thailand with 11.4 billion Malaysian ringgit US$3.16 billion and Indonesia was in fourth position with 4.7 billion Malaysian ringgit. 
So it is incorrect to assume that foreign investment in Malaysia has been declining, said Tan Yee Kew in response to Yan Lian Hoe's leader of Barisan National Bukit Gantang statement that foreign investment in Malaysia is lower than those in its neighboring countries in ASEAN. 
He further said that the 10 main investors in Malaysia in 2005 and 2006 were Japan with 8.1 billion ringgit, the United States with 7.6 billion ringgit, the Netherlands 5 billion ringgit, Singapore 4.9 billion ringgit, Australia 2.7 billion ringgit, Korea 1.1 billion ringgit, Cayman Islands 1 billion ringgit, Taiwan 0.8 billion ringgit and the United Kingdom with 0.7 billion ringgit. 
Plantation company PT Astra Agro Lestari said on Thursday its palm oil production in the first quarter of 2007 fell 8.3 percent to 808,475 tons of fresh fruit bunch from the same period last year.
The drop in production resulted from drought in the first half of 2006 and the impact of the drought was still felt in the first quarter of 2007, the company's director, Julie Syaftari said in a report to the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
Syftari said production from the company's oil palm plantations in Kalimantan dropped 23.9 percent and in Sumatra 6.5 percent.
Only the company's oil palm plantations in Sulawesi saw a 14.2 percent increase in production.
The decline in palm oil production led to a 10 percent drop in the company's crude palm oil CPO to 200,662 tons in the first quarter of 2007 from 223,000 tons in the first quarter a year earlier, she said.
The Deposit Insurance Agency LPS has lowered its insurance rate LPS rate for the April 15 to May 14, 2007 period by 25 basis points to 9 percent for savings in commercial banks and to 12.75 percent for savings in smallholder credit banks.
The macro economy is getting better, while inflation and exchange rates continue their stability, LPS executive chief Krisna Wijaya said on Thursday. 
Although starting on March 22 the agency set the limit of secured savings at Rp100 million, the public's confidence in the banking industry remained high, he said.
Meanwhile, the agency maintained its insurance rate on dollar-denominated savings at 4.75 percent.
The LPS's measure to cut its rate made it equal to the central bank's benchmark interest rate BI rate of 9 percent.
Fitch Ratings said on Thursday it has assigned a National Long-term rating of 'AA-idn' AA minusidn to Indonesia-based PT Bank Pan Indonesia Tbk Panin.
The agency has also upgraded its Support Rating to '4' from '5' and affirmed its Individual Rating at 'C/D'.
At the same time, Fitch has assigned an expected rating of 'AA-idn' AA minusidn to the bank's proposed senior unsecured bonds programme of IDR1.5 trillion Bond II/2007, which will be issued in three tranches, maturing in three, five and seven years.
The Outlook for the ratings is Stable.
The ratings reflect the bank's strong capital position, high but moderately reserved non-performing loans NPLs, generally good profitability, as well as implied limited support from the sovereign and/or Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.
Panin is Indonesia's eighth largest bank 2.4% of system assets and ANZ has a minority interest in the bank.
Along with substantial growth in higher yield commercial lending, up 89% to IDR7trn in 2006, the bank's NIM improved to 5.1% in 2006 from 4.1% in 2005.
Meanwhile, higher non-interest income was recognized from the sale of government bonds in 2006.
Although operating expenses increased, they remained relatively manageable at about 3% of its average assets.
Overall, Panin posted stronger underlying profitability with pre-provision ROA of 3.2% in 2006, compared to 2.2% in 2005.
Its NPL ratio rose to 9.3% at end-2005 due partly to the application of stricter regulatory requirements on loan classification and less favourable macroeconomic conditions including fuel price hikes and subsequent interest rate increases from 2H2005.
However, the NPL ratio declined to 8.0% at end-2006 although in absolute terms it was still 8% higher at IDR1.5trn as compared with end-2005. 
About 83% of NPLs at end-2006 were corporate loans, which included several cases of large NPLs carried over from the Asian financial crisis.
The remaining 17% of NPLs were in the commercial and consumer segments, which increased in 2006 but from a low base with the combined NPL ratio at 2.1% at end-2006 from 1.7% at end-2005.
Ongoing loan restructuring efforts, particularly on a few of its larger corporate NPLs, and an improving economic outlook, are expected to help improve loan quality this year.
Provision cover was 82.3% of NPLs at end 2006, below 111% at end-2004 but stronger than peer average of about 60-70%. 
Fitch understands that secured lending accounted for the bulk of the bank's total loans at end-2006.
Capitalization was strong with total CAR of 29.5% at end-2006Tier 1: 21.8%, above industry average of 20.5%.
While this ratio may decline with the expansion of its loan book, targeted to grow by 25% in 2007, Fitch understands that Panin intends to maintain total CAR at 20% or more in the next few years.
Panin was established in 1971 by the Gunawan family who remain in control of the bank through a 45.1% stake held by PT Panin Life Tbk. ANZ acquired a minority 29.02% stake in 1999 and continues to provide technical assistance in areas like consumer banking, risk management, and IT support. 
Like several of its larger peers, Panin has shifted its lending towards the consumer and SME segments, which constituted a combined 64% of total loans at end-2006.
State-owned Bank Mandiri is planning to acquire a multi-finance company or bank with assets reaching a certain minimum amount, the bank's chief said. 
In our revised business plan, we will include a plan to acquire a multi-finance company or bank whose assets reach a certain minimum level, Bank Mandiri President Director Agus D.W. Martowardojo told newsmen after attending a state entterprises coordinating meeting which was also attended by State Enterprises Minister Sugiharto here Thursday. 
He said with Bank Mandiri's non-performing loan NPL ratio having dropped to below 5 percent in the first semester of 2007, its growth was expected to reach 10 percent in July.
Because of these prospects, the bank's business plan would be revised so as to accelerat its corporate growth. 
The bank's NPL ratio now stood at 4.7 percent so it was ready to develop its business by conducting a merger or acquire another financial entity, he said. 
Bank Mandiri has 5 business strategies and is striving to gain a share of 20 precent to 30 percent in the revenue pool in the respective market segments, he added. 
But Agus declined to give more details on his bank's plan to acquire a multi-finance company or bank, saying only let us just wait. 
Meanwhile, State Enterprises Minister Sugiharto said Bank Mandiri was able to lower its NPL rate from 16.17 percent or Rp16.2 trillion in 2005 to 6.06 percent or Rp6.6 trillion in 2006. 
In 2006, Bank Mandiri won The Best Overall for Corporate Governance Award and The Best Disclosure and Transparency title from Asia Money .
State Minister of National Development Planning Board Bappenas Paskah Suzetta is scheduled to meet with World Bank WB President Paul Wolfowitz in the International Monetary Fund/World Bank Spring Meeting in Washington, DC, this week.
To be accompanied by James Adams, World Bank vice president for Asia-Pacific, the minister will meet with Paul Wolfowitz, Bappenas spokesman Syahrial Loetan said here on Friday.
Syahrial said the Bappenas minister in the meeting would talk on Indonesia's latest condition as the result of intermitent disaster early this year, and would probably ask for low-interest loan from the World Bank.
James Adams gave a direction yesterday that he would help Indonesia get International Development Assistant IDA with a low interest rate, Syahrial said, adding that it might be difficult because Indonesia has been classified into the middle income countries. 
However, he said the possibility to ask for a loan with low-interest rate from the World Bank was an anticipatory measure because the interest rate from IDA is only around 0 to 2 percent per-year.
He added that the presence of Bappenas minister in the International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting would be as an alternate governor of World Bank in Indonesia, while the World Bank governor in Indoesia is Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawqati.
Japan has granted US1 million to Indonesia to help support tax administration systems and improve tax services, a spokesman said.
Tax administration systems are a key to improving an investment climate and mobilizing funds for development programs.
Japan remains committed to helping the Indonesian government improve its tax systems, spokesman of the Japanese Embassy in Jakarta Ken Okinawa was quoted as saying in a World Bank press release issued on Friday.

Japan is collaborating with the World Bank in helping the Directorate General of Taxation modernize a plan to support institutional and organisational reforms, and resouces management.
Acting World Bank country director for Indonesia Joel Hellman said Indonesia had made a good start in its agenda of tax reforms. 
The government would continue maintaining Indonesia's fiscal resilience in anticipation of possible over exposure of Indonesian economy by foreign parties by monitoring all foreign loans as many private companies are eying foreign financing schemes.
This matter will affect our payment balance.
Thus we have to monitor them foreign loans, Governor of Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank Burhanuddin Abdullah said after a limited coordination meeting on the exposure of the Indonesian economy here Monday.
The meeting which was attended by all the monetary and fiscal decision makers had yet to decide whether the foreign commercial loan coordination team which was formed under the presidential decree no.39/1991 would be continued or not, he said.
The discussion at the meeting is still at the early stage.
The question is whether or not the team would be continued, the governor said.
Burhanuddin said the meeting did not discuss limitation of borrowings by the private sector including state-owned companies. 
Data available at the central bank showed the Indonesian outstanding foreign loans in 2006 stayed on a declining trend to reach US$125.257 billion per December, 2006.
The oustanding foreign loans by the end of the first three months of 2006 reached US$134.627 billion and the value dropped to US$127.528 billion by the end of the 3rd three months of 2006.
Publicly-listed automotive spare parts maker PT Astra Otoparts Tbk said on Monday it has agreed to sell its 7,072 shares in PT Exedy Indonesia to the Japanese-based Exedy Corporation for Rp12.977 billion.

The share sales will be valid if all conditions in the binding sales purchase agreement are met, she said.

Non-performing loans in the textile and textile product TPT industry in March 2007 were recorded at 23.37 percent or far higher than those in the banking industry which stood at 6.6 percent, a Bank Indonesia BI executive said.
The figure has created the perception that the TPT making is a sunset industry, BI Deputy Governor Hartadi A Sarwono said at a function to familiarize TPT industry businessmen about a TPT technology improvement program here Wednesday.
The government has actually decided that the TPT industry is one of ten main industries that must be developed but efforts to develop its production capacity have run into problems, he said. 
In March 2007 the banking sector provided non-leather TPT industries with Rp27.5 trillion in credits or 32,6 percent of the overal amount of bank credits which was Rp843 trillion.
The banking sector's reluctance to extend cedits to the TPT industry prevented the industry from making progress, he said adding that the government had given the industry subsidy to buy machinery. 
The government had earmarked Rp255 billion for a TPT industry machinery purchasing program in 2007. 
Meanwhile, director general for textile machinery and metal industry Ansari Bukhari said bank credit disbursement to the TPT industry sector was still good.
However, he added the high risk in the TPT industry had discouraged banks from allocating large amounts of credit for the the industry. 
TPT industry needs Rp50 trillion to modernize its machinery but the banking sector is only ready to allocate Rp2 trillion for the program, he said.
The TPT industry made a contribution of US$9.4 billion to national exports in 2006.
Ansari said his office would encourage the TPT industry to increase its contribution to national exports to US$10 billion this year.

Sales in the January-March 2007 period rose 16.4 percent to around Rp1 trillion due in part to an increase in average selling prices of crude palm oil, the company's director, Santosa said in a report to the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
CPO price climbed 37.5 percent to Rp4,591 a kg in the first quarter of 2007 from Rp3,340 a kg in the previous quarter, he said.
He said sales fell by 9.6 percent to 263,956 tons in the January-March 2007 period from the same period last year due to a drop in fresh fruit bunches.
However, a surge in CPO global prices caused the average selling prices of CPO and kernels to increase by 43 percent and 22.9 percent respectively, he said.
Indonesia's non-oil/gas exports are expected to grow by only 9 percent this year as the balance of payment will face a slowdown in the global economy and a slump in the prices of export commodities, a senior central bank official said. 
On the other hand, the country's economic growth would be much driven by demand for imported goods, Senior Deputy Bank Indonesia BI Governor Miranda S. Goeltom said in a national seminar on the role of diplomacy in spurring export growth here on Tuesday.
Non-oil/gas imports were projected to grow by 14.5 percent this year.
Consequently, the country's trade surplus would fall from last year when it reached a historic record of US$15 million, she said.
She said non-oil/gas exports remained the main engine of the country's economic growth.
We should like to admit that exports play a key role as the engine of economic growth and the source of foreign exchange earnings, she added.
To spur exports, the government must issue a regulation to address export barriers, including the low competitive edge of domestic products, and the poor role of supporting agencies in increasing exports, she said.
An efficient system and procedure capable of erasing the high cost economy was badly needed to boost exports, she said.
Senior deputy governor of Bank Indonesia BI Miranda Goeltom said here on Tuesday she believed the country's economy would grow only BY 6.2 percent this year although the government had set it at 6.3 percent.
In a working meeting with House Commission IX Miranda said the government had to analyze sources of growth that would push the economy to grow by 5.97 percent in the first quarter to see if they have a multiplying effect, and whether the trend of growth was rising.
She said however that the figures could still change in line with quarter-to-quarter developments.
She said Bank Indonesia meanwhile had projected the country's economy to grow between 6.2 and 6.8 percent in 2008 with an inflation rate at 5 percent plus and minus one percent, the key interest rate for three months at 7.5 and 8.0 percent, the rupiah exchange rate at Rp9,000 and Rp9,300 against the US dollar, the oil price at US$56 per barrel and oil output at 1.034 and 1.040 million barrels a day.
State-owned Bank Mandiri will set aside some US$35 million in funds in 2008 for the cost of maintenance and expanding its information technology capacity, a sokesman said. 
This the funds is already set in our draft but it is likely to be increased due to the particular situation where new technology purchase is necessary, Bank Mandiri Techonology and Operational affairs director Sasmita said here Friday. 
Bank Mandiri has been providing the information and technology investment since 2000 with the initial investment of US$200 million, Sasmita said, adding that of the amount only US$168 million had so far been used.
According to him, the bank in the period 2004-2007 spent about 30 to 35 million US dollars on information technology per year on the average. 
In 2008, we still set the same amount although it is possible to change increase, he said.
He said further that Bank Mandiri could reduce the IT spending from 5 to 10 percent per year due to the stability of its installed capacity.
This year Bank Mandiri has also installed another 400 Authomatic Teller Machines ATM, making the total number or its ATM 2,650 across the country.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati had predicted this year's revised state budget deficit to decline to Rp49.5 trillion from Rp58.3 trillion in 2006 amid an increase in the government subsidy for fuel oil and electricity. 
However the Rp49.5 trillion deficit in 2007 is smaller than the last year's Rp58.3 trillion, the minister said at a press conference after a cabinet plenary meeting at the presidential office here on Tuesday. 
A decline in deficit was caused by an increase in the state expenditures and decline in revenue as well as the government's success in reducing the expenditures for ministers by Rp24.9 trillion. 
The state's income, he added, rose to Rp724.5 trillion from Rp690 trillion, while the state budget increased Rp774 trillion following a rise in subsidy for fuel oil which had surged to Rp88.2 trillion from Rp55 trillion and Rp43.5 trillion from Rp 32.4 trillion for electricity.
In the meantime, Economic Affairs Coordinating Minister Boediono said this year's revised state budget was secured, despite the world oil price hike. 
For 2008, the government has prepared a change in parameter that may be implemented by making some calculation in fuel oil prices, consumption, production and the rupiah exchange rate.
Generally everything is are under control with the government taking steps designed to cut reduce its subsidy like by efficient use of fuel oil and electricity, he said. 
However, according to Budiono, next year's state budget will be secured if oil production can be maintained at Rp1.034 million barrels per day or if possible, increased. 
The Vice President will directly supervise oil production by establishing a special team in the 2008 state budget as a result of world oil price to reach US$100 per barrel. 
Assuming that oil price reached US$100 per barrel in 2008, Budiono said the 2008 state budget will rise by 1.8 percent to Rp75.8 trillion, Budiono said. 
Indonesian credit rating agency Pefindo has assigned idBBB+ ratings for construction company PT Truba Jaya Engineering TRJE and its proposed 2.5-year bond I/2007 of up to Rp300 billion, with stable outlook.
The ratings reflected growing demand for construction business and the company's strong business position in power and industrial plant construction business, Pefindo analyst Ronald Hertanto said in a statement on Wednesday.
However, the ratings were constrained by the company's average business stability and large working capital requirement in the future that could lead to weakening financial profile, he said.
TRJE is engaged in providing project management, engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction of industrial, power plant, oil & gas plant, mining plant and fertilizer plant.
Established in 1976, TRJE is a joint venture company between Jurong Engineering Limited of Singapore JEL and PT Tri Usaha Bhakti.
It was previously known as PT Truba Jurong Engineering.
Since late August 2007, it changed its name into PT Truba Jaya Engineering after PT Manunggal Infrasolusi had acquired 45 percent of JEL's shares.
PT Manunggal Infrasolusi which is owned by PT Truba Alam Manunggal Engineering Tbk. TRBA is the major owner of TRJE with 96 percent stake.
The remaining shares will be held by PT Multi Energi Persada 2.3 percent and PT Kurnia Unggul Sejahtera 1.7 percent.
Indonesia has asked the Asian Development Bank ADB for the extension of its loans for a number of hydro-powered plant PLTA projects with a total value of US$7.5 million.
Indonesia has asked that the ADB loans, which would have been ended in 2008, be extended until 2011, RM Dewo Broto Joko of the National Development Planning Board Beppenas said here on Sunday.
He said that the ADB was considering to approve the request because the projects were utilizing renewable energies and were part of the clean development mechanism CDM.
He cited as an example the Poigar PLTA project in North Sulawesi whose construction had been delayed because the land acquisition and resettlement plan LARP for the project had not yet been completed.
There were still a large number of ADB-financed PLTA projects in West Kalimantan, Gorontalo, Lombok and Flores, for which we are asking extension from the bank, he added.
Publicly-listed plantation company PT Bakrie Sumatera Plantations said on Tuesday it has bought 2,700 shares with a face value of Rp1,000 each from PT Nibung Arthamulia based in Palembang, South Sumatera.

The frequency of share trading reached 2,343 times with a volume of 52,033 shares and a value of Rp424.222 billion US$42.42 million on Tuesday.

The government is planning to increase the retail sale prices HJE of cigarettes in March in an effort to achieve its excise tax revenue target of Rp42.03 in 2007, a Finance Ministry official said.
He said that the revenue target of Rp42.03 trillion from excise taxes in 2007 was unlikely to be achieved unless the retail prices of cigarettes were raised and a specific tax rate was imposed.
He said that without an increase in retail prices, the state revenues could only reach Rp39 trillion to Rp40 trillion. 
Anwar said a specific tax rate, namely a tax rate for each piece of cigarettes could be imposed to narrow the gap among the tariff rate categories of different cigarettes.
The gap among the tariff rate categories caused cigarette makers to produce cigarettes with low tax rate categories, he said.
We are introducing specific tax rates which enable small-and medium-scale firms to pay lower cigarette taxes than their larger counterparts do, he added.
The government and the House of Representatives have set excise tax revenues in the state budget for 2006 at Rp38.5 trillion. Of the target, only Rp37.9 trillion were realized.
For 2007, the government and the House of Representatives set the target at Rp42.03 trillion. 
The target was raised from Rp38.5 trillion last year to Rp42.03 trillion in 2007 because the state needs more funds to finance projects such as infrastructure and education, he added.
He said that the decision to increase the retail prices of cigarettes and to impose a specific tax rate was not taken all of a sudden.
This decision was taken since the beginning so that businesses would get legal certainty, he added.
He said that the government had plan to raise the retail price of cigarettes in March 2007 and to apply the specific rate taxes in June 2007.
Fitch Ratings said on Monday it has revised Indonesia's outlook on the foreign and local currency Issuer Default ratings  IDRs  to positive from stable, while affirming both ratings at 'BB-' BB minus. 
At the same time, the agency has also affirmed Indonesia's short-term IDR at 'B' and the country ceiling at 'BB'.
The revision to the outlook on Indonesia's sovereign ratings reflects the authorities' commitment to maintaining economic stability and fiscal discipline, as well as the government's stronger top-down policy intent to implement a structural reform agenda aimed at improving the investment climate, Ai Ling Ngiam, Director in Fitch's Sovereign Ratings team in Singapore, said.
Fitch said the government's efforts to tackle key investor concerns on corruption, bureaucratic and regulatory hindrances particularly in the areas of taxation and customs may slowly be paying off.
A culture of fear of openly engaging in corruption has emerged amid anti-corruption investigations leading to several high profile prosecutions, asset recoveries and rising complaints via the whistle-blower programme, the agency said.
Meanwhile, the government's electronic open tender procurement system has improved transparency, it noted.
Indonesia has also improved its ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, moving up to 50 in 2006 from 69 in 2005, it said.
Public finances and improving surveillance of broader fiscal risks are Indonesia's fundamental rating strengths.
Fitch forecasts the fiscal deficit will stay manageable at 1.1% of GDP this year, while the government debt-to-GDP ratio should drop to around 38% this year, levels last seen only in 1997 and better than the 41% median for the 'BB' rating category.
Nonetheless, the agency said, the debt-to-revenue ratio of 212% in 2006 is less favourable than the 'BB' median of 162% and further tax efforts are needed to increase revenue. 
Domestic debt re-profiling efforts have successfully reduced the bunching risks of domestic debt repayments in 2007-2009 by switching these bonds into long-dated bonds maturing in 2010 and 2025, it said.
On the external front, a strong build-up in the forex reserves position thanks to commodity price increases, larger-than-expected import compression by manufacturers and robust portfolio inflows has provided a more comfortable cushion to deal with systemic shocks, it said.
Indonesia's gross financing requirement including short-term debt is expected to drop to around 66% of official reserves, in line with the 'BB' median, it said.
Nonetheless, it added, Indonesia's external balance sheet risks remain, as an up-tick in emerging market risk aversion could lead to a disruptive outflow of portfolio equity or debt investment, while a larger resident accumulation of private external assets may also weigh on the balance of payments.
Furthermore, on the current account front, a higher consumer and manufacturers' import bill attributable to the recovery in real GDP growth to approximately 5.9% this year from 5.6% in 2006 pose dollar demand pressures, it said.
The agency further said trade facilitation through the creation of Special Economic Zones, the push for an Economic Partnership Agreement with top export destination Japan and the implementation of National Single Window scheme for traders by 2008 is vital to raise Indonesia's current external receipts  CXR .
Indonesia's gross external debt, external debt service and interest service ratios are weak compared to 'BB' peer medians. 
Looking ahead, Fitch said the resilience of the external position will require accelerated efforts to build sustainable capital inflows in the form of foreign direct investment  FDI , as a preferred alternative to possibly volatile portfolio flows.
Indonesia's export competitiveness will also need to be addressed in the near term with greater urgency to improve Indonesia's credit risk profile, it said.
The government is in the process of forming a Forest Development Financing Company BUPPH that will finance development of 5.4 million hectares of smallholder's forests with a total of Rp9.7 trillion in funds from the Reforestation Fund DR, a spokesman said.
We discussed further steps toward BUPPH's establishment and they have been approved by the Finance Minister, Forestry Minister MS Ka'ban said after a meeting with Finance Minister Sri Mulyani on Monday.
Ka'ban said the drafting of a joint ministerial decree on the BUPPH's establishment was expected to be completed on February 1 at the latest and issued in mid-February.
The BUPPH would function as a public service body BLU to manage Rp9.7 trillion in rolling funds from the Reforestation Fund's Forest Development Account DR RPH.  
This is for development of community-based forests across Indonesia, They could be located in Riau, Jambi or other provinces, he added.   
He said it was necessary to develop community-based forests to enable the people to gain access to forest resources and play a role in the plantation sector.
Besides, critical fallow lands will be also be made more productive, he said.
About the mechanism to channel the funds to the people, the minister said recipients could return the amounts they had borrowed after harvest time with the understanding that one planting season would last seven years.
People could enjoy the borrowing facility individually or through local cooperatives , business companies or farmer groups, he said. 
Ka'ban said development of the community-based forests would cover a total area of 5.4 million hectares and be completed in 2014.

World Bank country director in Indonesia, Adrew Steer, will soon be replaced because he will be given a new post in London, England.
I will leave Indonesia for London on February 28 to work for the British government.
I will remain in the World Bank but I have to be responsible to the British government, Steer said on the sidelines of a conference on public spending here on Monday.
Steer said having been World Bank country director in Indonesia since 2002, he had seen the country make a lot of economic progress from time to time.
I have to leave Indonesia for London but I don't know who will replace me, Steer said.
He said Indonesia would continue to face new challenges in the years to come but they would lead the country to greater success.
The government at present is in a financially strong position and this is very good for Indonesia.
Therefore, with the new challenges, I am certain the country will make a lot of progress in the future, he said.
Asked about the dissolution of the Consultative Group on Indonesia CGI by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Steer said he fully supported the government's decision because it was a sign of success.
I am glad CGI is dissolved because in my opinion, the dissolution is a sign of success.
CGI is actually good for Indonesia but in view of the country's progress, the CGI is no longer needed, Andrew noted.
However, he added that it was important for Indonesia to remain having both multilateral and bilateral dialogs with the international community.
But it is not necessary to sit at one table and make such commitments, Steer said, adding on the other hand that multilateral dialogs as such were not a bad thing as they could save Indonesia time because they enabled Indonesia to meet and talk with about 35 donor countries and institutions at the same time. 
The National Development Planning Board Bappenas has proposed the cancellation of 11 projects funded with offshore loans worth US$370 million made between 2000 and 2006. 
Because we want the loans to be used effectively and efficiently, Bappenas proposes the cancellation of foreign-funded projects which according to the result of our monitoring turn out to be very slow, State Minister for National Development Planning/Bappenas chief Paskah Suzetta said on Thursday.
The projects were funded with loans made between 2000 and 2006, he said.
By the end of 2006, the amount of loans pledged by foreign countries and agencies reached US$13.7 billion, of which US$5.9 billion had been disbursed, he said.
The delay in the disbursement of loans is among others caused by phases of the projects.
For instance, the disbursement of loan for construction work cannot yet be made because it still has to wait for land acquisition for the project concerned, he said.
According to the agreement with the House of Representatives' Budgetary Committee, the amount of offshore loans to be withdrawn this year would reach US$4.3 billion, he said.
Data from the Bappenas show that by the end of 2006, the country's outstanding loans stood at US$1,314.4 billion, accounting for 40.4 percent of the gross domestic product GDP.
The loans consisted of domestic loans worth US$ 693.1 billion or 21.3 percent of the GDP and offshore loans worth US$621.2 billion or 19.1 percent of the GDP.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said that Bank Indonesia BI should consult the government before taking any monetary policy because monetary and fiscal polices were intertwined with each other.
Communication and coordination should always be made with regard to various monetary and fiscal matters, including on the instrument types, time of issuance and the impact they may have on the monetary and fiscal conditions, the minister said after attending a meeting on tax affairs at the parliament building here on Thursday.
The finance minister made the remarks in response to the central bank's plan to issue six-month and nine-month BI certificates SBIs.
Asked on whether or not the BI plan to issue the six-month and nine-month SBIs would affect its plan to issue state treasury bonds SPN, the minister said it would not create any problem.
She said that advanced countries also had different kinds of monetary instruments which also had different maturity dates.
Advanced countries have complete monetary instruments which fall mature on different times, she said.
BI previously stated it would issue the SBI monetary instrument with longer maturity dates, namely six to nine months to achieve a better curve yield.
The additional monetary instrument is expected to be issued in the second semester of this year.
The bonds that were issued on Feb 22, 200 and will mature on July 15, 2022 could be traded starting the date of listing, chief of the bourse's bonds trading division Erna Dewayani said. 
On Tuesday, the government auctioned the bonds issued at a weighted average yield of 10.69 percent and earned Rp4 trillion from the auction.
In the auction, the government received bids worth Rp7.565 trillion with the highest yield of 13 percent and the lowest yield of 10.5 percent, spokesman of the Finance Ministry Samsuar Said said.
Proceeds from the bonds issue will be used to help cover a deficit in the 2007 state budget and repay maturing bonds, he said.
The government is planning to issue state bonds with a gross value of Rp66.686 trillion and a net value of Rp40.606 trillion this year, he said. 
The 2007 state budget deficit is expected to reach Rp40.512 trillion, while the state bonds that will mature this year will amount to Rp24.49 trillion, he said.

Bank Indonesia BI has decided to lower its key rate by another 25 base points to 9.00 percent from 9.25 percent previously, the central bank's strategic planning director and spokesman Budi Mulya said here Tuesday.
The decision to reduce the benchmark rate known as BI Rate was made based on the assumption that the inflation rate in 2007 would be manageable and the macro-economic sector would remain on the track, he said.
The central bank has set the national inflation rate target for 2007 at about 6 percent.
Bank Indonesia has several times cut its key rate by 25 base points since May 2006 when it was still at 12.50 percent.
The central bank last reduced the rate by 25 base points to 9.25 percent in February from 9.50 percent in the previous month.

Meanwhile, net interest income NII showed an upward trend, jumping to Rp7.9 trillion, the highest since the monetary crisis engulfed the country nine years ago, he said.
The return on assets ROA rose to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent, fueled by a rise in net interest income, he said.
He said the amount of non-performing loans had also been successfully kept down as a result of the restructuring of debts incurred by large borrowers.
January's NPLs accounted for 6.8 percent of the total outstanding loans, down from 7 percent at the end of 2006.
Based on the business plans submitted by banks to the central bank, they were committed to improving their intermediary function this year, he said.
Bank lendings grew by 14 percent in 2006 with the total outstanding loans reaching Rp832.90 trillion by the end of last year.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said here on Tuesday that the state budget was still in a surplus in the first two months of the year as receipts had met the target while absorption of the budget was slow.
Receipts are still on track.
Expenditures are rather slow.
I have not seen it in their overall condition, but it seems it is still in a surplus in the first two months, she said.
She said that only a few draft regional budgets had been approved by regional legislative assemblies so that the funds distributed to the regions were mostly general allocation funds for paying salaries.
So there has not been any expansion, she said.
Regarding the government's income, the minister said it was still positive and had even increased by funds from the sales of international bonds last February.
Pressure will be seen clearly later in the second or third quarters namely the balance between income and expenditures when several debt payments are due and expenditures begin, she said.
The director general of treasuary, Herry Purnomo, meanwhile said until the end of February the state's tax revenue had reached Rp40 to Rp50 trillion of the projected Rp452.556 trillion in 2007.
It covers only added-value and income tax and does not yet include tax on foreign currencies, he said.
He said receipts from the excise sector were recorded at more than Rp10 trillion.
He said absorption of the budget was still low reaching only five percent, unlike that for the general allocation fund and employee expenditures.
The budget is still safe until now as expenditures are still small.
Expenditures on goods this year are still small, less than five percent, he said.
He said the state's expenditures in 2007 reached Rp763 trillion, of the central administration Rp504 trillion, and Rp259 trillion by provincial and district administrations.

The rupiah on the Jakarta inter-bank spot market weakened on Friday afternoon as market players released the Indonesian unit although foreign investors have entered Indonesia to deal in Bank Indonesia certificates, state debentures and bonds. 
The local unit weakened to Rp9,175/9,180 against the US dollar compared to Rp9,165/9,177 to the US greenback at the closing session on the previous day, foreign exchange analyst of PT Bank Saudara, Ruri Nova, said here Friday
Ruri said the rupiah was under pressure as market players speculated to release the Indonesian currency. 
The movement to release the rupiah was somewhat impeded by the presence of foreign investors in the domestic market to invest in Bank Indonesia certificates, state debentures and Indonesian retail bonds. 
Thus, the rupiah still has an opportunity to strengthen next week as foreign investors would increase their investment in the country, she said.
Ruri said with the presence of foreign investors to invest in e instruments of Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank, BI should be more active on the market to maintain the stability of the rupiah to prevent from moving within a wider range.
The rupiah which after the Fed lowered its interest rate by 50 basis points strengthened to below Rp9,200 per US dollar tended to rebound, encouraged by the presence of funds from foreign investors in the domestic market, she said.  
She said the rupiah still had an opportunity to strengthen but the increase should not be too quick as such a condition would weaken the Indonesian unit fast too.  
We are optimistic that BI will remain on the market to maintain the rupiah's stability so that its rate will not be far from its current position, she said. 
Market players, she said, were still waiting for the issuance of data on US economic indicators which would show whether the US economy will strengthen or weaken.  
If the US economy weakened, the rupiah would get big support and was expected to reach the level of Rp9,000 per US dollar, she said.
The profit-taking action might be taken only for speculation due to the improving US dollar on the regional market but the market's positive sentiment was still moving toward the rupiah, she said.

The upward trend in world oil prices can lower Indonesia's economic growth rate to a level below its target of 6.5 percent in 2008, Senior Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia BI Miranda Goeltom said here on Wednesday.
Speaking at a round-table discussion, the central bank official said that the world oil price hikes would decrease the private sector's consumption as a result of the weakening of its purchasing power due to inflation and increased imported good prices.
A sharp decrease in domestic demand will push down economic growth in 2008 despite the fact that net exports are predicted to increase and imports to drop, she said.
Fueled by world oil and global primary goods price hikes, inflation will exert pressures on the economy.
These risks are the result of oil-price fueled imported inflation, she said during the discussion on the empowerment of the production sector.
Studies predicted that inflation in 2008 had the potential of exceeding the targeted five-plus-one percent and would reach 6.4 percent if the average price of world oil reached US$75 per barrel.
The high increase in the inflation rate is based on the assumption that the government will not subsidize oil prices, Goeltom said.
She said that based on simulations the effect of an average oil price of US$60 per barrel would boost inflation to 6.1 percent, US$68 per barrel would fuel 6.26 percent and US$70 per barrel to 6.3 percent.
The BI senior deputy governor added that a price of US$75 per barrel would increase the inflation rate to 6.4 percent, US$80 per barrel 6.5 percent, US$85 per barrel 6.6 percent and US$95 per barrel 6.8 percent.
Publicly-listed plantation company PT Bakrie Sumatra Plantation Tbk said its profit in the first nine months ended Sept. 30 fell 6 percent to Rp136.14 billion from a year earlier due to increased interest expenses.

Interest expenses jumped to Rp115.24 billion from Rp38.76 billion, causing non-operating expenses to climb to Rp126.06 billion from Rp7.15 billion.
Indonesia's monthly inflation slightly eased to 0.79 percent in October from 0.80 percent a month earlier, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said.
October's inflation brought calendar inflation to 5.24 percent and on-year inflation to 6.88 percent, BPS Chief Rusman Heriawan said on Thursday.
The question of whether it will remain at or exceed 6 percent until the end of December depends on the remaining 0.76 percent inflation in November and December.
In November last year, inflation eased to 0.34 percent, but we cannot expect it to recur, he said.
The government has set the 2007 inflation target at 6 percent and Bank Indonesia the central bank at 6, plus and minus 1, percent.
He said Indonesia would likely see the so-called demand full inflation in December due to pressure from the rising prices of consumer goods ahead of Christmas and New Year festivities.
Inflation clocked in at 1.04 percent in December 2006. 
The BPS noted that the prices of foodstuffs last month rose 1.87 percent, processed food, beverages, cigarettes and tobacco 0.51 percent, housing, drinking water, electricity, gas and fuel oil 0.21 percent, clothing 2.05 percent, healthcare services 0.45 percent, education, recreation and sports 0.21 percent, and transportation, communication and financial services 0.47 percent. 
October's core inflation, which excludes swings in administered prices like fuel and volatile commodity prices, such as food prices was running at 0.80 percent, bringing core inflation in the calendar year to 5.12 percent and on-year inflation to 6.13 percent, he said.

The Indonesian economy is expected to expand by 6.2 percent this year on the back of increased consumption and high exports, a central bank official said.
Economic growth was expected to reach 6.3 percent in the third quarter of 2007 and 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter, Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Governor Miranda S Goeltom said at a working meeting with the House of Representatives Commission on finance and banking here on Monday.
The rupiah strengthened at an average of Rp9,101 per dollar in October, up 2.2 percent from a month earlier due to strong economic fundamentals and the US dollar's depreciation against other global currencies, she said.
This prompted the composite index to hit its highest level in October 2007, fueled by capital inflows, she said.
In late October, the country's foreign exchange reserves stood at US$54.2 billion, she said.
The inflation rate in October fell to 6.88 percent from 6.95 percent the month before due to a drop in the prices of volatile food, she said.
Indonesia's budget surplus in the first nine months of 2007 ended Oct. 31 reached Rp17.6 trillion, a minister said.
State revenues stood at Rp524.3 trillion and state expenditures at Rp506.6 trillion, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said at a working meeting with a Regional Representatives Council DPD's ad hoc committee here Tuesday.
The state receipts and expenditures respectively represented 75.5 percent and 67.3 percent of the target set in the revised 2007 state budget, she said.
Until Oct. 31, the central government's expenditures reached Rp310.1 trillion or 62.3 percent of the state budget and regional governments' expenditures Rp196.5 trillion or 77.3 percent of the state budget, she said.
The minister said the country's inflation rate was expected to reach 6.5 percent and the economic growth rate 6.3 percent this year.
The rupiah's exchange rate against the dollar was projected to average Rp9,125 per dollar, interest on three-month Bank Indonesia certificates 7.95 percent and oil production 910,000 barrels per day, she said.
The country's foreign exchange reserves were expected to reach US$56.6 billion at the end of this year, she said. 
She said exports would contribute 8 percent to economic growth, household consumption 5 percent and investment 10 percent.
In the revised 2007 state budget, the government has set the targets of economic growth at 6.3 percent, inflation at 6 percent, the rupiah's exchange rate at Rp9,050 per dollar, interest on three-month Bank Indonesia certificates at 8 percent, the crude oil price at US$60 per barrel and oil production at 950,000 barrels per day.
Judging by the above indicators, the budget deficit was expected to remain at 1.5 percent or Rp58 trillion of the state budget with state receipts projected at Rp722.1 trillion, up by Rp28 trillion from the revised state budget and state expenditures at Rp780.3 trillion, up by Rp27.9 trillion from the revised state budget, she said.
Bank Indonesia's 2007 foreign exchange reserve at the end of the year was expected to reach US$56.655 billion due to the recent increase in world crude oil prices, Senior Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank, Miranda Goeltom, said. 
Early in the year when the world oil price was assumed at US$62 per barrel, the state's foreign exchange reserve amounted to US$54.3 billion. 
With the change of the average oil price to US$69.8 per barrel BI's prediction, the foreign exchange reserve reached US$56.655 billion, she said at a hearing with the House of Representatives here Tuesday. 
The increase in world crude oil prices raised Indonesia's balance of payment surplus in 2007 higher than expected, she said, adding that the surplus was also caused by the increase in commodity prices and capital and financial transactions expected to give positive impact.
The world crude oil price hike had also stablized the rupiah exchange rate in November, 2007, reaching Rp 9,107 against the US dollar. 
Thus, the average exchange rate of the rupiah against the US dollar in 2007 would range from Rp9,050 to Rp9,125, she said.   
However, the central bank noted that negative sentiments could affect the Indonesian economy, like the sentiment on the inflation before the end of 2007.
There has been a slight increase in the inflation rate, which is apparent in the result of a survey conducted by BI.
This is an indicator we are observing to prevent excessive pressure on the inflation, she said.

Bank Mandiri President Director Agus Martowardoyo and PT Petrokimia Gresik President Director Arifin Tasrif signed the loan agreement here on Wednesday.
The loans represented 70 percent of the total funds needed to build the four new plants, while the rest would be provided by Petrokimia Petroges, Martowardoyo said.
Meanwhile, Arifin said until 2009 Petrokimia would build nine projects, including a 25-MW coal-fired power plant. 
The PLTU scheduled to become operational in late 2009 or early in 2010 was designed to anticipate higher crude oil prices, he said.
By switching to coal, Petrokimia could save Rp100 billion per year.
The company had to use oil due to a lack of gas supplies in the past five years, he said.
Due to the lack of gas supplies, the company's fertilizer production could not reach the maximum level, he said. 
Petrokimia currently received gas totaling 42 million MMSCFD out of 62 million MMSCFD per day as agreed upon in the contract, he said.

Economic growth hit six-month highs in June.
This is very convincing and provides a conducive climate, Anggito Abimanyu, head of the ministry's fiscal policy board, said here Thursday.
With the economy expected to expand in the range of 6-6.1 percent in the second quarter, the government was optimistic about the economy growing by 6.3 percent as projected, he said.
Looking ahead, the Finance Ministry saw the economy in the third and fourth quarters expanding by 6.3 percent and 6.5 percent respectively.
The real sector showed signs of very positive development in June 2007.
Tax receipts grew 50 percent on-year in June.
Overall, tax receipts in the first semester grew 20.8 percent, he said.

Bank Indonesia, the central bank, said the country's balance of payments this year is likely to record an estimated surplus of US$13.4 billion.
The surplus will originate from a surplus in current accounts projected at US$8.9 billion and a surplus in capital and financial accounts estimated at US$4.9 billion, Bank Indonesia Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said in a working meeting with the House of Representatives DPR which began Thursday night and ended in the wee hours of Friday. 
Foreign exchange reserves at the end of this year were projected to reach US$56.2 billion -- enough to finance imports and foreign debt repayments for 5.6 months -- he said. 
In the first half of 2007, the balance of payments saw a surplus of US$3.7 billion, helped by good performance in capital and financial accounts, he said.
Capital and financial accounts recorded a surplus of US$1.7 billion in the second quarter although it was 26 percent lower than the figure on the first quarter, he said.
The surplus was driven by foreign capital inflows in the form of portfolio investment, he said.
Bank Indonesia BI Governor Burhanudin Abdullah said Indonesia had yet to recover from the financial crisis that took place ten years ago.
This is reflected in the existence of an anomaly between the BI benchmark rate and bank deposit interest rates in Indonesia at present, the central bank governor told the House of Representatives Financial Commsission at a hearing which began Thursday evening and lasted until the wee hours of Friday.
He said the anomaly lay in the fact that the BI rate 8.25 percent was higher than the bank deposit rate 5 percnet.
The BI benchmark rate should have been lower than the bank deposit interest rate, he added.
BI could not solve the problem by suddenly drastically lowering its benchmark rate, Burhanudin Abdullah said.
We are trying to lower the BI rate gradually while continuing to maintain stability.
Hopefully, the BI rate can be cut further in the future, he added.
He said a drastic and sudden lowering of the BI rate to below the bank deposit interest rates would disturb the economy as it would trigger sharp fluctuations in the bank deposit rates.
What BI was doing now is lowering the becnmark rate by 0.25 percent graually.
We are lowering the BI rate by 0.25 percent gradually because we have to observe prudential principles, he added.
Stock rating agency PT Pefindo has assigned an A- rating to privately-run telecommunications operator PT Bakrie Telecom's bond worth Rp750 billion issued this year to finance part of its capital expenditure.
The rating reflects favorable telecommunications industry and potential business model, Pefindo analysts Niken Indriarshi and Salyadi Saputra told the Jakarta Stock Exchange on Friday.
However, the rating was weakened by the company's aggressive business expansion that might lead to high financial leverage and expose it to high risks of fluctuations in the rupah's exchange rate against foreign currencies and increasingly fiercer competition among telecommunications operators, they said.
As of March 31, 2007 Bakrie Telecom was 50.25 percent owned by Bakrie Brothers, 15.08 percent by CMA Fund Management, 3.17 percent by PT Bakrie Communications, 2.08 percent by Richweb Investment Ltd. and 29.43 percent by the public.

Finance minister Sri Mulyani meanwhile said indications about the improving condition of the sector could also be seen from increasing revenue from income tax PPh and value added tax PPN which estimatedly could be higher than the average inflation rate of six percent.
In terms of sectors almost all sectors actually recorded strong PPh and PPN growth, at least up double digit in 2007, she said.
The growth of PPh in the construction sector reached 30 percent while PPN 39.2 percent, while the growth of PPh and PPN in the trade, hotel and restaurant sector was recorded respectively at 25.8 percent and 27.4 percent.
The PPh in the transportation and communication sector grew 35.4 percent while its PPN 3.4 percent.
Other sectors linked to primary sectors such as agriculture, mining both oil and gas and non-oil and gas grew even above ten percent.
Processing industries that have so far been considered job creators also recorded significant PPh and PPN growth respectively at 10.4 percent and 12.4 percent, she said.
She said a similar trend was also seen in the processing industries like food and beverage industry which recorded a 19.5 percent PPh growth after a negative growth before.
The PPh in the textile industry meanwhile grew 6.3 percent from minus 1.2 percent before, she said.
She said metal industry which recorded a minus 6.7 percent PPh growth last year now recorded a positive 8.9 percent, while electronic industry now recorded a PPh growth of 8.7 percent from minus 13.6 percent before and motobike industry recorded a 16 percent PPh growth from minus 30 percent last year.
Sri Mulyani said banking credits to the sector reached around Rp35 trillion until June this year, up from around Rp15 trillion in May.
The growth of banking credits has occured since August 2006.
Again this shows there has been clear recovery of the sector, she said.
She said the recovery of the sector could also be seen from increasing capital expenditures in the state-owned companies reaching up to 22 percent.
Minister Boediono said although there had been a positive develoment in the real sector President Yudhoyono still called for the strengthening of the economic stability especially with regard to public basic necessaries.
The president called for careful attention to avoid unpredictable price hikes of basic necessaries, he said.
He also called for eradication of investment barriers to create higher economic growth to create jobs and reduce poverty.
Rupiah dropped to the level of Rp9,100 against the US dollar on the Jakarta Inter Bank Spot Market Wednesday morning as market agents continued to sell the Indonesian unit and buy the US greenback.
Rupiah's exchange rate drastically decreased to Rp9,100/9,105 to the US dollar compared to Rp9,070/9,072 against the US currency or weakened by 30 points over the weekend.
Retail Banking Director of PT Bank Mega Tbk publicly listed, Kostaman Thayib said here the market agents actively released rupiah making the Indonesian currency continue to plunge.  
According to Kostaman, rupiah should actually strengthen as the Indonesian capital market is ameliorating when the Jakarta Stock Exchange JSE's index continues to strengthen reaching 2,355 in the morning.  
Rupiah was difficult to predict as when a positive sentiment appeared, the local currency even dropped and vice versa, he said.
The drop in the housing sector has pressured the US economic growth triggering The Fed to lower the US interest rate, he said. 
The US dollar dropped to 1,3836 against euro and it would even weaken to 1,3845 due to the bigger release of the US currency while Japanese yen to the US greenback reached 121.32.  
We predict that rupiah will still be corrected at the afternoon closing session as the market pressure is still big although the US dollar weakens on the regional market, he said.
He said Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank is now only observing the rupiah movement and has yet to enter the market in anticipation of further pressures as rupiah is still considered stable.  
BI will likely enter the market if rupiah remains under pressure when the figure exceeds the level of Rp9,200 to the US dollar, he said.

Publicly-listed heavy-duty equipment company PT United Tractors Tbk announced on Thursday its net consolidated income in the first half of 2007 rose 18 percent to Rp8.19 trillion from the same period last year.
Growing demand for heavy-duty equipment in the non-mining sector over the period raised the contribution of the company's construction machine division to its total income by 51 percent from 48 percent a year earlier, the company's corporate secretary, Tjandrawati Waas, said in a report to the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
Meanwhile, the mining contractor division's contribution to the company's overall income reached 41 percent and the remaining 8 percent originated from the company's coal sales from the coal mining concessions it acquired from PT Dasa Eka Jasatama on April 30, 2007, she said.
Despite the rise in net consolidated income, the company saw a decline in its gross profit margins to 16.6 percent from 18.2 percent due to a drop in gross profit margins in its mining contractor division, she said.
Compared to the same period last year, corporate profit margins in the first half of 2007 rose to 11.4 percent from 10.9 percent, she said.
The company posted a net profit of Rp552 billion in the first semester of 2007, up 3 percent from the same period last year, she said.
PT International Nickel Indonesia's INCO sales jumped 198 percent in the first semerster of this year to US$1.036 billion from US$440.5 million in the same period last year.
Its president director, Arif Siregar, in a media gathering here on Thursday said the sales hike had raised the company's net profit in the period by 473 percent to US$707 million from US$123.3 million a year earlier.
He said the sales hike followed a rise in the price of nickel in matte to US$38.926 per ton in the second quarter of this year from US$14.326 in the same period last year and US$29.140 in the first quarter of this year.
He said the hike was also driven by nickel production which rose 18 percent to 39,000 tons in the first semester of this year from 32,000 tons last year.
An above-the-average rainfall since the end of February has increased a bit the water level at our main pool so that the company could raise the operation of its hydro-powered generator to a normal level, he said.
He said with the rising production he believed the company's production target of between 160 million and 165 million tons in matte for this year would be achieved.
The company's director, Sri Kuncoro, meanwhile said the company this year purchased 32 diesel-powered generators that could produce 32 megawatts of electricity to give additional power to the company.
He said the diesel-powered generators would make it possible for the company to maintain production while the operation of its steam-powered generators was halted for maintaianance in the second quarter.
Efforts to expedite sustainable and high economic and investment growth cannot be optimized without the support of the corporate sector, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said here on Tuesday.
No matter how intensive the efforts made by the government to accelerate sustainable investment and economic growth, it will not be optimum without the support of corporations in the country, the minister said on the occasion of the handing over of the 2006 Annual Report Awards here.
The minister said enterpreneurship and innovative ability of business owners to turn challanges into opportunities would decide the extent of their contributions to supporting national economic and investment growth.
She said corporations were also required to show their care not only for shareholders but also for other stakeholders representing the nation's interest.
This is a dimension which gives birth to the noble principles of good governance which includes transparency, accountability, responsibility, independence and fairness, the minister said.
Sri Mulyani said the application of the five principles consistently was important not only for stakeholders but also for image building or positive perception of the nation in the eyes of global business people and other countries.
As parts of its endeavor to implement good governance, the government was carrying out bureaucratic reform programs aimed at building the government's capacity and ablility in boosting national economic growth and providing maximum services to the public.
We hope that it would eventually create public trust towards bureaucracy, she added.
On the occasion, winners of the 2006 Annual Reports Awards were announced, which consisted of six categories.
The six categories were publicly listed state-owned financial companies BUMN, listed non financial BUMN, publicaly listed private financial institutions, listed non-financial BUMN, unlisted non-financial BUMN and unlisted non-financial private institutions.
The Annual Reports Awards is an annual event which this year is held for the sixth time since it was held in 2002.

In the first quarter of 2007, transportation and communication sectors reached the highest growth of 5.2 percent; followed by electricity, gas and clean water sector which stood at 4.9 percent; while trade, hotel and restaurant sector by 3.7 percent.
In the first quarter of 2006, transportation and communication sector expanded by 11.9 percent; electricity, gas, and clean water by 10.5 percent; as well as trade, hotel and restaurant by 8.3 percent.
Export growth occurred in nickel, metal ash, copper, automotive sector, as well as industrial and chemical production.
The economic growth was significantly boosted by an increase in government budget absorbance including in goods, employee and capital expenditures, Slamet said. 
Government's goods expenditure jumped to Rp37.04 trillion in the second quarter of 2007 compared to Rp34.29 trillion in the first quarter of 2007; employee expenditure rose to Rp46.83 trillion compared to Rp35.66 trillion; and capital expenditure increased to Rp9.66 trillion from Rp2.63 trillion.

The Indonesian government expects its 2008 state budget to suffer a deficit of Rp75 trillion or 1.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product GDP, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said.
The reason behind the deficit is linked strongly to the government's fiscal policy in its efforts to stimulate the country's economy, the President said when delivering his state-of-the-nation address and the government's financial notes at the parliament building here on Thursday.
The head of state said the deficit would result from the difference between the state expenditure estimated at Rp836.4 trillion and the state revenues and grants projected at Rp761.4 trillion.
In the draft 2008 state budget domestic budget financing had been projected at Rp97.7 trillion which would originate among others from the issuance of government bonds worth Rp91.6 trillion, the sales of assets worth Rp0.6 trillion under the bank restructuring program, and the proceeds from the privatization of state firms worth Rp1.5 trillion.
In the meantime, budget financing that originates from overseas loans are expected at a net amount of negative Rp16.7 trillion, as a result of the withdrawal of program credits and project credits amounting to Rp43 trillion, which is less than the instalments of foreign debt principal amounting to Rp59.7 trillion, he said.
The negative amount of overseas loans was consistent with the government's aim to reduce the share of foreign debt instalments in the budget income, he said.
Yet, the increase in the state budget deficit should be matched with fiscal resilience, he said.
The steps to increase the fiscal resilience should be undertaken in a prudent, transparent and accountable way in the arrangement of government bonds, he said.
In addition, efforts should be made to minimize cost and credit risk as well as to improve the loan portfolio structure.
By doing so, the government's credit ratio is expected to fall by 33 percent in late 2008, he said.
The decrease in credit ratio would strengthen the fiscal resilience, which was in line with the primary aim of embracing sustainable fiscal independency, he said.
Such is vital, especially in such volitile economy, he said.
The president said the financial notes for the first time included risk and influential factor which would immensely influence the state budget.
The risk factors were derived from revised economic assumptions and macro economic indicators, infrastructure development program, public service obligation and the welfare of state enterprises, as well as other factors such as natural disasters and pension regulation and social security programs, he said.
The government has set revenues from taxes at Rp583.7 trillion in the draft 2008 state budget, which are Rp93.8 trilion or 19.1 percent higher than the Rp489.9 trillion set in the previous revised 2007 state budget.
The tax revenues in the draft 2008 state budget are set at 13.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product GDP, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said in his State of the Nation Address on the Draft 2008 State Budget and Government's Financial Notes at the parliament building here on Thursday.
The president said that the revenue target in 2008 was expected to come from domestic tax incomes amounting to Rp568.3 trillion and international trade taxes valued at Rp15.4 trillion.
Yudhoyono said that in order to maximize revenues in the 2008 state budget, the government would continue to carry out reforms on its administration and improvements in tax, customs and excise systems.
The government has set revenues from taxes at Rp583.7 trillion in the draft 2008 state budget, which are Rp93.8 trilion or 19.1 percent higher than the Rp489.9 trillion set in the previous revised 2007 state budget.
The House of Representatives DPR has finished deliberating amendment of Law on General Provinsions on Tax, revision on Law on Customs and Law on Excise, the president said.
On the other hand, state revenues from non-tax sources in 2008 are estimated at Rp175.6 trillion, or Rp16.2 trillion lower than the the amount of non-tax incomes in 2007.
He said that the non-tax revenues in 2008 were lower than those in 2007 because the government's incomes from the profits of state enterprises and from other non-tax sources also dropped.
The government continues to carry out improvement measures on provisions and legislations which are related to non-tax income sources as well as on the optimizing and intensifying state incomes, the head of state said.
The president also extended his appreciation to the DPR for its success in accompalishing three laws which supported the implementation of provisions on tax revenues and incomes from non-tax sources.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said he was convinced Indonesia will be able to survive the present upheaval in global stock markets with minimum harm. 
I am optimistic that with our fundamental economy and finance
Our foreign exchange reserves and other enforcing efforts, we will
God willing weather these upheavals with the least possible harm, he said in his address on the 2008 Draft State Budget and the government's Financial Notes at a House of Representatives DPR plenary session on Thursday.
He noted that during the past few days, people could see the upheaval in the world's stock markets in the decline of the subprime mortgage in the United States. 
The impact that could be felt was the corrected price of the stakes and the weakened exchange rates all over the world, including in Indonesia.
This condition reminds us that globalization, besides opening new opportunities for our development, also brings risks that should be watched. 
We do hope that efforts being made by the financial authorities in the developed nations will succeed in overcoming the problem, he said.
At home, he added, the government was also making anticipative efforts by strengthening coordination between the fiscal and monetary authorities to heighten alertness.
He further said although the nation's journey was not always smooth and easy, there should be trust that the direction taken was already on the right track.
In the last part of his speech, the president called on the people to use all the existing resources and capabilities, including fiscal policies, efficiently and effectively in the implementation of national development in 2008 and thus all the results of national development could be enjoyed by all the people. 
Bank Indonesia central bank/BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah has expressed optimism that the country's economic growth in 2008 will hit the government-set target of 6.8 percent.
I think that it is an optimistic target. 
Even I believe the economy will expand in the range of 6.5-7 percent next year, Burhanuddin said after President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono delivered his state-of-the-nation address and the government's financial notes at the parliament building here Thursday.
Burhanuddin said the growth would be driven by among others growing investment.
Today, more and more banks are channeling infrastructure credits, he said.
In the draft 2008 state budget, the government has set the economic growth target of 6.8 percent for 2008 with the budget deficit expected to reach 1.7 percent of the gross domestic product, or equivalent to Rp75.1 trillion.
The deficit would result from the difference between state revenues and grants estimated at Rp761.4 trillion and state expenditure projected at Rp836.4 trillion.
The central government's expenditure is projected at Rp564.6 trillion and regional governments' expenditure at Rp271.8 trillion.
Bank Indonesia BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said the conditions of the world economy were now improving so that the rupiah's exchange rate was expected to restabilize at around Rp9,000 per US dollar.
Based on latest reports, world economic conditions are increasingly conducive and manageable. 
Currency exchange rates have returned to their fair levels, so has the composite price index and the market of state debentures, the central bank governor said after a meeting with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono here on Monday.
He said with such conditions, the rupiah exchange rate would regain stability, depite the fact that it was now moving towards a new equilibrium which necessitated BI to remain in the market to watch its developments and to prevent the emergence of signs of possible extreme volatility.
We will continue to watch and keep stability under control so that we can develop the national economy with a sense of security, he said.
He said during the weakening of the rupiah last week, BI intervened in the market only slightly because the domestic economy and the United States' mortgage bond turmoil were not too closely inter-related.
What happened was not more than an adjustment to a portfolio which affected us, he said.
The BI governor said with the estimate that the rupiah rate would return to its normal level, the inflation target which was set at 6-6.5 percent this year would be achieved.
The rupiah on Monday regained its strength against the US dollar at Rp9,370 per US dollar after it plunged to Rp9,450 last week.
Bank Indonesia BI Deputy Governor Aslim Tadjuddin said here on Monday the central bank would strive to maintain the rupiah's exchange rate at between Rp9,000 and Rp9,300 against the US dollar in 2008.
The range is quite realistic considering the improving development of fundamental factors in the national economy, he said at a meeting with members of Commission XI of the House of Representatives DPR.
He said although the national currency had come under pressure following the recent subprime mortgage crisis in the US, he hoped the rupiah's exchange rate would be more controllable after a variety of measures had been taken by several central banks in the developed world, especially the US Federal Reserve to control the problem.
Seeing the progress in the efforts to overcome the crisis we hope global financial market conditions would recover and have a positive impact on the domestic market, he said.
He said the negative impact of the crisis was not the fundamental cause of the pressure on the rupiah. 
But he also said BI and the government would remain alert towards the possible impact of the crisis.
Therefore, BI and the government would always maintain the stability of the macro-economic indicators by giving positive signals to the financial market to increase market confidence in the stability of the country's financial system and macro-economy.
With regard the government's assumption of the rupiah exchange rate of Rp9,100 against the US dollar in the draft 2008 budget, he said it was still realistic and in line with BI's expectations.
Indonesia had to spend US$127 million of its foreign exchangge reserves to intervene in the money market to prevent the rupiah from weakening due to the impact of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the US as well as to repay debts, a central bank official said.
The amount of our foreign exchange reserves obviously dropped as we needed part of it to intervene in the money market to maintain the rupiah's exchange rate as well as to repay debts, Deputy Bank Indonesia Governor Aslim Tajudin said following a meeting with the House of Representatives DPR Commission XI on finance, banking industry and non-bank financial institutions here Monday.
The country's foreign exchange reserves fell to US$51.73 billion in the week ending on August 23 from US$51.9 billion late last month, he said.
As a central bank, Bank Indonesia deemed it necessary to intervene in the money market to prevent the local currency from falling so that it would not endanger the economy, he said.
We absolutely needed the funds from the foreign exchange reserves to conduct the market intervention to prevent the rupiah from becoming volatile, he said.
He expressed hope the current mortgage credit crisis would immediately be overcome after the measures taken by the US Federal Reserve had shown signs of improvement.
But in the days ahead the measures taken by the Fed to cut its interest rate as expected by all sides will hopefully ease the impact of the subprime mortgage credit meltdown and this will in turn have a positive impact on the rupiah's exchange rate, he said.
As result, the rupiah was expected to return to the level of Rp9,000 per dollar, he said.
Stock rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia Pefindo has reaffirmed East Java regional government-owned Bank Jatim's idA- single A minus; stable outlook rating for the period of July 31, 2007 to July 11, 2008, the agency said.
The rating was based on the bank's audited financial statement ended on December 31, 2006 and its unaudited financial statement ended on March 31, 2007, Pefindo President Director Kahlil Rowter said in a statement on Tuesday.
The rating meant that the bank had stronger capability supports than any other Indonesian obligors to meet its long-term financial obligations, he said.
The downside risk to the rating pertained to an adverse change in conditions, he said.
The mark - meant that the rating was relatively weak and below its average category, he said.
PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk, Indonesia's largest publicly-listed oil and gas firm, said Tuesday it has transferred a total of 1,689,393,006 shares or 50.695 percent of its shares issued, to its Singapore-based new subsidiary, Encore Energy Pte. Ltd.
The shares were formerly owned by Medco's subsidiaries -- Dencisco Energy Resources Pte. Ltd. and Aman Energy Resources Pte. Ltd., MedcoEnergi Director Yani Panigoro said in a report to the Capital Market and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency Bapepam-LK.
He said Mitsubishi Corporation, one of Japan's largest publicly-listed trading companies, had acquired 39.4 percent of Encore Energy's shares for US$352 million.
Given the deal, Encore and Mitsubishi had indirect ownership interest of 30.721 percent and 19.974 percent respectively in MedcoEnergi, he said. 
Encore Energy remained MedcoEnergi's controlling shareholder, he said.
Rupiah plummeted on the Jakarta Inter Bank Spot Market on Tuesday morning to Rp9,405/9,415 to the US dollar compared to Rp9,375/9,385 at the closing session on the previous day, an observer has said.
Money market observer Edwin Sinaga said here Tuesday the Subprime Mortgage case financial crisis in the US still triggered worries especially on the prospect of the US economic growth. 
Thus local market agents preferred holding US dollars to rupiahs although Bank Indonesia the central bank remained to maintain the rate of the Indonesian currency, he said. 
The central bank even expected rupiah would rebound to the level of Rp9,000 to the US dollar, he said.
The Indonesian unit dropped because market agents worried about the economic condition in the US which is a potential market for export products of Asian countries, he added.      
He pointed out that the Subprime Mortgage case in the US has actually not abated and even tended to continue, he said.    
According to him, rupiah is still difficult to strengthen to the level of Rp9,000 to the US dollar as the global money market has yet to come to normal. 
We predict that rupiah will still continue to weaken to the position of Rp9,420-Rp9,430 to the US greenback, he said.
Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia Muliaman D Hadad said the central bank's credits increased by more than 20 percent by August 2007 in view of the realization of Regional State Budgets APBD. 
The increase reached more than 20 percent, he said after a hearing with Commission XI of the House of Representatives DPR in Jakarta on Tuesday.
He said that the rate of increase was normally higher in the second semester due to the realization of regional and state budgets.
In this context, he believed that the credit growth this year would reach 21-22 percent under the central bank's business plan.
He said that the credits have been growing by 20-25 trillion, but still less than June's Rp 36 trillion.
In the meantime, despite the minor obstacles posed by the still high interest rates, and which have yet to be adjusted to the declining BI Rate, the banks were still conducting their intermediary role. 
The high interest rates, he said, was caused by the still high cost of fund, profit margin, and overhead cost.
Under such circumstances, he called on the banks to lower their credit interest rates, which are currently ranging from 9,6-13,8 percent. 
But he said that the interest rates could be lowered in a situation in which the banking business has become increasingly competitive, so that the intermediary role played by the banks is improving.
But I must admit that the loan and credit interest rates have been lowered, but still less than hoped for, while Bank Indonesia has already familiarized the banks with these obstacles, he said.

Bank Indonesia BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said here on Wednesday the bank would strive to make the exchange rate of the country's currency stable at around Rp9,000 against the US dollar in support of the real sector.
We will try to make it stable meaning we will maintain its volatility. 
He said the effort was important to avoid possible damage on the economy. 
We must never let the rate change excessively within a very short period because it will disrupt business, he said.
He said BI did not intend to hold the rupiah. 
What is maintained is its volatility, not its rate. 
Based on the last two actions the trend is downward. 
First it collected Rp16 trillion and then it dropped by a few trillions. 
The trend is levelling off, downward, he said.
According to him, this was a good indication because it meant banks were expanding in the credit sector. 
Expansion in the credit sector has begun although the speed is not as fast as we hoped for. 
I think by the end of the year it will be faster, he said.
He said credit distribution had not yet been optimal with the lending-to-deposit ratio reaching more than 60 percent while banking funds currently invested in SBIs reached around Rp170 trillion.
Regarding the use of State Treasury Certificates SPN to replace the SBI Burhanuddin said the time still had yet to be determined. 
Indeed ideally it must be used to replace the SBI like in other countries, he said.
Bank Indonesia Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said here on Wednesday following the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS report about deflation in April there was now room for the central bank to make another cut in its key intrest rate BI rate.
Because of the deflation there is room for adjusting the BI Rate as I have said before, he said.
He said he was convinced the 8.5 percent target of the BI Rate would be achieved this year as a result of developments in the country's economic conditions.
He said deflation would also make it easier for BI to achieve its interest rate cutting target. 
Bank Indonesia predicts this year's inflation will be six percent plus or minus one percent.
The Central Bureau of Statistics reported recently a deflation of 0.16 percent was recorded in April making the calendar year inflation to reach 1.74 percent and the year-on-year inflation 6.29 percent.
The deflation was mainly driven by a drop in the rice price of 5.16 percent in April to contribute a deflation of 0.37 percent. 
The price of red chili was also down 19.26 percent to contribute a deflation of 0.17 percent, the chief of the Central Bureau of Statitistics, Rusman Heriawan, said on Tuesday.
Sectorally contribution to the deflation came from the prices of food that dropped 1.30 percent and education, recreation and sports by 0.30 percent.
He said the office however still recorded a significant hike in the prices of processed foods, beverages, cigarettes and tobacco 0.38 percent, housing, water, electricity, gas and fuels 0.26 percent, health 0.32 percent, transport, communication and financial services 0.22 percent.
Bank Indonesia BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said on Thursday the country's economic growth in 2007 would be good if it reached 6 percent, the same as the net point of the central bank's projection of 5.7-6.3 percent.
I think if it the economic growth reaches the net point of 6 percent, it will be good, he said after the opening of a national development planning conference here.
The economic growth target could be achieved if it was supported by a high growth of investment, a 18-20 percent growth of bank lending and effective absorption of bank loans, he said.
Asked to comment on the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS's prediction that the economic growth in the first quarter of 2007 had exceeded the central bank's projection of 5.4 percent, he said it was possible.
Let's wait for the BPS's announcement on May 15, he said.
The Finance Ministry has set the economic growth target for the first quarter of 2007 at 5.7-5.9 percent.
BPS chief Rusman Heriawan said earlier if the economy only expanded 6 percent in the first three months of 2007, the government must work harder in the following quarters to achieve the economic growth target of 6.3 percent for this year.

Right now work is being done to finalize monitoring of loans during the last three months of 2006, Lukita Dirmansyah Tuwo, Bappenas deputy head for development funding, told ANTARA on Monday.
According to data from Bank Indonesia central bank the position of the government's outstanding foreign loan up to December 2006 was US$74.126 billion.

Banking circles are optimistic that Indonesia will not undergo a monetary crisis like in 1997 because the government had suceeded in increasing the economic growth rate and curbing the inflation rate, a private banker said.
Indonesia is not likely to experience a monetary crisis as the country has big amounts of foreign exchange reserves and assets while banks are actively distributing their credits to different sectors like infrastructure, director of Bank Muamalat a private syariah bank Andy Buchari said when seeing off 365 winners of prizes to perform Umrah minor haj pilgrimage in Mecca here Monday. 
He said investments in the infrastructure sector like electricity and toll road projects were already in operation and banks has financed the projects both through syndication and individual basis in the regions and Jakarta.
Economic growth has been running in the right direction.
So the prediction that Indonesia will undergo monetary crisis in 2008 is not true, he said.
Data showed Indonesia's exports in March 2007 increased by 10 percent or higher than that of last month and investment was also up by 27 percent, he said, adding that such a condition was expected to boost economic growth which was supported by the real sector.
According to him, although economic growth was hampered by various disasters in the country like the hot mudflow, floods, earthquakes and social unrest, the government had wisely coped with the problems.
Efforts to make the economy grow rapidly need time and struggles so that the economic target could be reached, Andy said.
He further said the government had improved the investment climate, encouraged banks to be more active in distributing credits to the people and spend the state budget for productive sectors.
The government had even promoted the use of funds to encourage small- and medium-scale enterprises to peform better as the sector was proven to be strong enough during the monetary crisis in 1997, he said.
On the rupiah, he said the Indonesian currency would continue to strengthen up to Rp9,000 against the US dollar, and Bank Indonesia 
the central bank would keep it at that level.
He said the rupiah would remain stable as the rate now reached below the level of Rp8,800 per US dollar as the amount of foreign funds which went to the capital market and money market was increasing.
We are optimistic that during the week, the rupiah will continue to strengthen to near the level of Rp8,700 per US dollar, he said.
He said the increase in the rupiah's value would also be triggered by a drop in the US interest rate, now reaching 5.25 percent, and Japan's central bank's plan to raise its interest rate. 
Thus, the rupiah could still strengthen to a level higher than the current position, he added.
The draft of a presidential decision on the government's 2008 work plan will be issued on Tuesday, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Boediono said here on Monday.

Bank Indonesia BI considered the growth recorded at 5.97 percent in the first quarter this year quite good and reasonable.
The 5.97 percent growth was quite good.
To BI that has set the target at six percent the growth is quite good and reasonable, deputy governor of the central bank, Aslim Tadjuddin, said here on Tuesday.
He said however that the economy should grow more than that 5.97 percent in order to create employment and reduce poverty.
The government's target is 6.3 percent.
If they wish to create employment they must not be satisfied with just fulfilling the target, he said.

We estimate the economic growth in the third quarter of 2007 at 6.2-6.4 percent.
Until the end of this year, consumption will likely remain stable, and so will exports.
We hope investment will further increase, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said here on Thursday.

It seemed that pressure on the rupiah's exchange rate had shown signs of abating in early August 2007 and the local unit strengthened at Rp9,000-Rp9,100 per dollar until late September, the board said.
But then many foreign investors invested capital there so that China is now developing very rapidly, while Indonesia has been going nowhere, Markus said.
Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said on Wednesday the planned import of liquefied natural gas LNG from Qatar was to meet medium-term needs.

The plan to curtail gas supply to PT PKT would lead to a shortage in gas supply to the plant but this would be covered by gas imports from Qatar, he said.
The gas swap is aimed at fulfilling PT PIM's gas needs.
Because of PT PIM's need for gas, the Arun gas field cannot export.
In the short run, PT PIM's gas needs will be met by the Bontang refinary and in the medium run, it will be met by gas imports from Qatar, he said.
The minister further said the coordination meeting focused on resolving micro problems related to gas supply to industries in North Sumatra and West Java.

The ratings reflected the bank's sound assets and strong capitalization, Pefindo analysts Yans Simbolon and Hendro Utomo said in a statement.
The downside risk to the ratings pertains to the limited size of the bank and the concentration of its funding sources, the statement said.
Established on August 1, 1964 as a regional development bank and starting operations in January 1966, the bank changed its name and status into PT Bank Pembangunan Daerah Lampung in April 1999.
As per April 2007, the bank was 49.9 percent owned by the Lampung provincial government, 48.0 percent by district administrations and 2.1 percent by its employees.

Indonesia's private oil and gas company PT Medco Energi Internasional MEDC through its subsidiaries Medco Far East Ltd and Medco E&P Malaka MedcoEnergi and its partner Premier Oil Sumatra North BV has taken over a 100 percent of the stake in Aceh-based ConocoPhillips Ltd CPAL which was controlled by Conoco Philips.
CPAL owned 50 percent of the working interest of Block A production sharing contract KPS Block A in Aceh and the CEO director of the block, MedcoEnergi, Hilmi Panigoro said in a report to the Capital Market Supervisory Agency's Financial Institution Bapepam-LK here Wednesday. 
With the signing of the taking-over of transaction on January 23, 2007, MedcoEnergi and Premier owned 50 percent of the stake in CPAL.
The cost MedcoEnergi has paid to take over 50 percent stake in CPAL amounts to US$36 million, he said.
In April 2006 MedcoEnergi as well as its partners Premier and Japan Petrolleum Exploration Co. Ltd. Japex took over 100 percent ownership of Mobil Block A MBAL from ExxonMobil Block A Investment Ltd that controlled 50 percent of the working interest of Block A.
The acquisition, Hilmi said, gave MedcoEnergi, Premier and Japex respectively 16.67 percent, 16.66 percent and 16.67 percent of the ownership of KPS Block A.
Totally, in effect, the extent of ownership of MedcoEnergi and its partners over KPS Block A increased to 41.67 percent for Medco Far East & Medco Malaka, 41.66 percent for Premier and 16.67 percent for Japex, thus MedcoEnergi becomes the operator of the KPS Block A, Hilmi said.

The government will try its best to maintain the country's economic growth at the level it reached in the fourth quarter of 2006, namely 6.1 percent, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said here on Monday.
Economic growth reached 6.1 percent in the last quarter of 2006.
We will try our best to keep it at the same level in 2007, the minister told a hearing with the House Commission XI which among other things deals with financial affairs.
The minister admitted that economic growth in 2006 which reached only 5.5 percent had missed its 6.1-percent target set in the 2006 state budget.
We have seen that economic growth in the first quarter of 2006 was very low as a result of the increase in the prices of fuel oils at home.
In the long run, we would see the development, which at present fourth quarter of 2006 has reached 6.1 percent, she said.
Asked whether the 6.1-percent ecomomic gowth target set in the 2007 state budget would be changed, the minister said a target change was usually made when the state budget was revised.
That can be done when the state budget is revised, she said.
Previsouly, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS released data on economic growth in 2006 which stood at 5.5 percent, which was slightly lower than the previous growth figure of 5.6 percent.
The decline in economic growth was a result of weakening investment growth which only stood at 2.9 percent in 2006.
Investment growth in 2005 was 10.8 percent and in 2004 it was 14.6 percent.
According to the BPS, year-on-year economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 stood at 6.1 percent but quarter-on-quarter economic growth experienced a contraction or a deline by 1.9 percent.

The Refinancing program will give a significant impact to PT Bosowa Marga Nusantara's financial report in 2007, he said. 
The Indonesian government hopes that an Economic Partnership Agreement EPA can be concluded with Japan before the end of 2007 as only a few sectors need to be agreed on in ongoing negotiations, an Indonesian diplomat said.
We are hoping all chapters in the EPA can be agreed on before late this year as the two governments are committed to stepping up their two countries' economic cooperation, head of the rconomic affairs section at the Indonesian Embassy in Tokyo, Mirza Nurhidayat, said here Monday.
Indonesia would soon follow a number of other ASEAN Association of Southeast Asian Nations member countries which had already signed EPAs with Japan, he said, adding that the Indonesia-Japan EPA was getting first priority considering the importance of economic relations between the two countries in the future.
It has become important considering that next year Indonesia and Japan will celebrate the 50th anniversary of their bilateral relations including the two countries' economic ties, he said.
The two countries have now accomplished a number of chapters in the EPA like those on business competition, government procurement, taxation and intellectual property rights.
The EPA concerns not only the trade and investment sectors but also the cooperation sector. 
Several sectors like those on energy, investment, trade and services are still under intensive discussions, he said.
Earlier, other ASEAN member countries like Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand had signed EPAs with Japan.
The Japanese cabinet late last week reached an agreement on free trade with Thailand.
Brunei Darussalam and Vietnam are now entering the early stage of EPA negotiations with Japan.
According to Japan's foreign ministry, the agreement was intended to accelerate trade and investment liberalization which would expand the two countries' economic activities.
Through the agreement, Japan and Thailand would scrap tariffs by more than 50 percent in their trade within ten years' time and Bangkok was expected to be more transparent and provide legal protection to Japanese investors.
Senior Deputy Bank Indonesia BI Governor Miranda Goeltom has expressed doubt that the country's household consumption growth in 2008 will reach the government-set target of 5.7-6.2 percent.
In the past five years household consumption grew only 2.3-4 percent.
Last year it expanded 4 percent.
If it the target for next year is set at more than 5 percent , the government needs to explain where the sources of the growth will come from, she said after a meeting with the House of Representatives' budget committee here on Thursday.
This does not mean that the target will not be achievable but we must make sure that the people's purchasing power is fairly high and the inflation rate is fairly low, she said.
Bank Indonesia Governor Burhanudin Abdullah said at a meeting with the House's Commission XI on finance, national development planning and non-bank financial institutions on Tuesday that the central bank had set the target of household consumption growth for this year at 4.2-5.2 percent.
He said the target was based on the people's low purchasing power and the high unemployment rate.
In our view, the people's purchasing power is still limited as can be seen from the ratio of savings to gross domestic product which is tending to decline.
The ratio of consumption credit to disposable income is fairly high, jumping to 37 percent from 22 percent previously, he said.
Bank Indonesia has projected the country's economic growth for 2008 at 6.2-6.8 percent, or lower than the government's economic growth forecast of 6.8-7.0 percent.
The central bank also has estimated investment growth in 2008 at 15-17 percent, or higher than the government's projection of 14.5-18.2 percent.
Privately-run Panin Bank posted a net profit of Rp726 billion in the third quarter of 2007, up 42 percent from the same period last year.
Net interest income increased Rp1.8 trillion as the amount of credits channeled rose 51 percent to Rp26.8 trillion, the bank's vice president director, Rosniaty Salihin, said on Tuesday.
Fee-based income rose to Rp520 billion from Rp419 billion, causing net interest margin to increase to 6.22 percent from 4.86 percent, she said.
Total assets climbed 38 percent to Rp48.9 trillion and equities rose 7 percent to Rp7.9 trillion in the month ended on Sept 30 compared to the same period last year.
Consequently, return on assets increased to 3.23 percent, return on equities to 14.36 percent from 14.32 percent, and loan-to-deposit ratio to 96.43 percent from 77.93 percent, while capital adequacy ratio fell to 23.72 percent from 33.12 percent.
The yen was slightly weaker in Asian trade on Monday as traders waited anxiously to see whether the Bank of Japan will decide to raise interest rates later this week, dealers said.
The dollar inched up to 119.44 yen in Tokyo afternoon trade from 119.37 in New York late last Friday.
The euro firmed from 1.3155 dollars from 1.3142 and to 157.10 yen from 156.91.
Traders were focused on the BoJ's monetary policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday amid thin trading, with financial markets closed in the United States and some Asian countries Monday for public holidays.
Although stronger-than-expected Japanese gross domestic product GDP figures last week were seen as boosting the chances of a rate hike to 0.5 percent, dealers are unsure whether the central bank is ready to make a move.
Government ministers are wary of an interest rate hike as they believe it could hurt the economic recovery, although they have been less vocal in their calls for steady rates than they were ahead of last month's meeting.
Many market watchers see roughly a 50-50 chance of an interest rate hike on Wednesday.
Market participants are also focused on this week's US economic news including consumer prices and the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's January interest rate meeting.
The dollar was hit last week by soft housing and inflation data which fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to hike interest rates soon, and if the weakness persists it could lead to rate cuts.
PT Gudang Garam, Indonesia's largest clove-flavored cigarette maker, posted a net profit of Rp404.309 billion in the first quarter of 2007, up by around 58 percent from Rp255.780 billion in the same period last year.

The Indonesian government hopes the country's present inflation rate will drop again in the next few months with the arrival of the harvest season which is expected to happen in March and to continue until April, a spokesman said.
We hope we can lower the inflation rate again within the next few months. 
We hope the prices of rice and other commodities will return to normal, Coordinating Minister for the Economy Boediono said after a coordination meeting to discuss infrastructures at the Finance Ministry Building here on Friday.
Boediono said the price of rice was a significant contributor to the inflation rate in February so the arrival of the harvest season was expected to be able to reduce the price of the commodity.
Besides rice, I do not see other commodities that contribute significantly to the inflation rate, he said.
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS, inflation in February this year was recorded at 0.62 percent while the year-on-year inflation figure was recorded at 6.30 percent.
The inflation rate from January to February this year meanwhile reached 1.67 percent.
The rice price hike contributed 0.52 percent of the 0.62 percent inflation rate, the BPS deputy for economic statistics, Pietojo, said.
Month-on-month inflation was recorded at 1.04 in January this year while the year-on-year inflation figure was recorded at 6.26 percent.
According to BPS, 31 out of 45 cities in the country experienced inflation and 14 cities deflation with the highest inflation occurring in Jayapura, namely 1.76 percent and the lowest in Lhokseumawe and Sibolga, namely 0.01 percent.
The highest deflation was recorded in Gorontalo 3.62 percent and the lowest in Bengkulu 0.02 percent, he said.
On reports about declining exports and imports of capital goods Boediono said monthly analyzes of these two activities would not yield accurate results. 
There are sometimes problems like disasters and other things which can also hinder exports or imports.
So let us see it not upon a monthly basis but semester by semester.
I am still optimistic our exports are still good, he said.
He said he was hopeful that the early downward trends in exports and imports would not eventually reflect the situation in the whole year.
The prices of our commodities are still reasonable.
Hopefully, these downturns will be mere temporary.
It is too risky if we have to react to data collected in just a month because they could be wrong.
So, for now, we had better remain calm, he said.
Bisnis Indonesia daily has named state-owned bank PT Bank Mandiri the most efficient bank among 130 banks existing in the country and winner of the daily's Banking Efficiency Award 2007.

We want the 2007 inflation rate to be below 6 percent.
If the inflation rate meets what we want to, I think all macro indicators can be maintained, meaning that the State Budget will not move far from the macro economic indicators, she said.

State-run Bank Rakyat Indonesia BRI will not abandon the micro, small and medium enterprises sector, although it has entered the infrastructure sector and provides corporate credits, a director has said.
Although we are now also dealing infrastructure including toll road development, we will give full support to micro, small and medium enterprises as we believed that reliable infrastructure smoothen the operation of businesses and the economy, BRI's micro, small and medium enterprises director Sulaiman Arif Arianto told the Asian Bankers Summit 2007 here Sunday.
BRI, he said, is committed to allocating 80 percent of its total credits to micro, small and medium enterprises and the remaining 20 percent to corporations this year.
Twenty pct of its credits covers the building of toll roads, he said.
Sulaiman said BRI will keep on developing its portofolio in the micro-financial sector.
Today, the micro-financial sector has developed rapidly into a very dynamic and innovative financial sector.
Many international financial institutions, banks, investors and donors have been actively eyeing the mic-rofinancial sector looking at it as a profitable investment portofolio, he said.
Asia, he said, is one of the regions in the world which has become a barometer of the world's micro-financial industry.
Micro-finance which originates from social activity to help less-fortunate people and poor farmers in rural areas has developed into a financial intermediation unit similar to a bank, he said.
BRI's uniqueness in its micro-financial sector is that the bank deals with the non-bankable market segment including less-fortunate people, he said.
The Asian Bankers Summit hopefully would make bankers more prepared for the micro-financial market, he said. 
Data showed that only 15 percent of over 42 million micro, small and medium enterprises in Indonesia has access to financial services.
These figures indicate that business people have good prospects in dealing with the micro-financial sector, Sulaiman said.

The central bank's director of public relations and strategic policies, Budi Mulia, said the reason behind the decision was the bank's strong confidence that inflation by the end of this year would be within the bank's target of six, plus or minus one, and five, plus or minus one, percent by the end of 2008.
However, the room and the time would be more limited for us to continue with the monetary policy this year.
In the future the opportunity will be more limited because of economic structural challenges, he said.
He said the structural challenges came from the offer side condition which was too stiff to make every move to push economic growth to result in a price hike and inflation pressure.

Indonesian credit ratings agency PT Pefindo stated it has increased Bank Rakyat Indonesia's Bank BRI rating from idAA- to idAA and its Rp500 billion subordinated I/2003 bond to idAA- .
The ratings reflected Bank BRI's strong franchise in financing micro-business and retail businesses and sound profitability, Pefindo stated in a statement made available here Thursday.

The decision by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to dissolve the Consultative Group on Indonesia CGI was expected to be a step to strengthen Indonesia's independence in formulating economic strategy and policies, a former minister said.
After more than 40 years since early in the New Order era, Indonesia was too dependent on the CGI formerly known as the IGGI the Inter Governmental Group on Indonbesia.
Practically, the consortium of creditors served as a cartel which forced Indonesia to follow the former's economic policies for the creditors' interest, former finance minister Rizal Ramli said here Thursday. 
According to the economic expert who strongly opposed the CGI, it was no guarantee that the creditor countries' interest could meet the interest of Indonesia and the people.
Thus, he added, Indonesia was unable to become a big country in Asia because it was the consortium of the creditor countries which dictated and formulated its economic policies.
In our experience, there was a member country of the consortium which only lent Indonesia US$100 million but frequently required a lot of conditions on economic, political and legal affairs among other things, Ramli said.
When he was a coordinating minister for economic affairs, Ramli along with his team visited Europe and the United States only to convince the creditor countries that Indonesia needed more leniency in developing its economy without disrupting relations between the two sides. 
However, the CGI served as a cartel that weakened Indonesia's bargaining position that time, he said.
The creditor countries also often used the CGI as a means to force Indonesia to buy capital goods from them with prices higher than those on the international market, he said.
In the new order era, President Soeharto liquidated the IGGI because among other reasons that the Netherlands showed dominant intervention in the forum, he said. 
Unfortunately, Soeharto and his team entrusted the World Bank making it to play a greater role in formulating Indonesia's economic policies, the former minister said.
In many cases, he noted, the borrowings from the World Bank and the CGI frequently obliged Indonesia to make laws and government regulations for the creditors' interest, not in favour of the country and the people.
Among the laws were law on water privatization which obliged farmers to pay for water and law on privatization of state-owned companies, he cited. 
Thus, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's courageous measure to discharge the CGI deserved a compliment in the hope the government would take other steps to make the national economy more independent, he said. 
Bank Indonesia BI or the central bank has set a target of fully implementing Bank Indonesia National Clearance System SKNBI in all 106 clearance regions this year, an official said.
The implementation of SKNBI in Palembang, Bengkulu, Bandar Lampung, Palangkaraya, Jambi and Lhokseumawe has caused 96 percent of clearance transaction nationwide to get connected.
The remaining 4 percent will be connected late this year, Bank Indonesia deputy governor S. Budi Rochadi said here Thursday.
He was here to inaugurate the implementation of SKBNI in six clearance regions in Sumatra and Kalimantan.
Data from the central bank show the value of daily clearance transactions reached Rp4.7 trillion as of January 2007. About Rp4.5 trillion of the figure was processed through SKBNI.
The value of clearance transactions in Palembang, Bengkulu, Bandar Lampung, Palangkaraya, Jambi and Lkhokseumawe was recorded at a total of Rp189.7 billion with a volume of 7,916 transactions daily.
Budi said for the banking sector, the SKNBI implementation will help banks use funds more efficiently in printing air letter as well as in managing human resources, among others.
An integrated SKNBI implementation can improve efficiency in bank liquidity management as a bank will no longer monitor the position of clearance transaction settlement in all clearance regions but only observe one clearance position nationwide, he said. 
Bank Indonesia is aware that the operational contribution of the transaction payment system to the economic growth is really dominant, Budi said. 
PT Bank Internasional Indonesia BII has developed an ATM network by setting up an ATM BERSAMA network provided by PT Artajasa Pembayaran Elektronis Artajasa, a statement said.
Through the partnership, BII will be connected with around 11,200 ATMs from 67 banks that have already joined the ATM BERSAMA network. 
BII itself has more than 700 ATMs and is also inked to ALTO network ATMs and Singapore's DBS/POSB Bank ATMs. 
The broadening of the ATM network is part of our efforts to improve BII customer services as well as our services to other banks' customers utilizing our ATM network, Henry Ho said. 
A national banker on Monday expressed deep regret over Bank Indonesia the central bank's decision to keep its benchmark interest rate BI Rate at 9 percent although it still had a wide room to fall further.
The lower-than-expected monthly inflation of 0.24 percent in March provided a room for the BI Rate to decline further, retail banking director of publicly listed PT Bank Mega, Kostaman Thayib said here Monday.
By keeping the BI Rate unchanged this month, Bank Indonesia appeared to take a precautionary measure to prevent capital flight, he said.
The policy however made it difficult for banks to lower their cost of fund soon, he said.
Only recently, the central bank issued a policy to loosen its credit rules to help banks increase their intermediary role as expected, he said.
But he added that the relaxation policy would be hampered following the decision to keep the BI Rate at 9 percent because banks still had to adjust their lending rates to it.
He said the lending rate, which now ranges between 13.5 percent and 14 percent, was still too high.
Ideally, it should be 12 percent.
State tin mining company PT Timah Tbk said on Tuesday its net profit in the first quarter of 2007 reached Rp314.3 billion, a huge jump from the same period last year when it was Rp11.6 billion.
The surge in net profit resulted from rising net sales in the three months ended on March 31, 2007 to Rp1.86 trillion from Rp809.8 billion in the same period a year earlier due to improving global tin prices, the company's unaudited quarterly financial report shows.
Operational profit in the first three months of 2007 climbed to Rp523.2 billion from Rp47.3 billion in the same period last year, proping up earning per share to Rp625 from Rp23.
PT Timah posted a net profit of Rp208.1 billion last year, up 93.6 percent from a year earlier.
The company in its recent general shareholders meeting said it would allocate 50 percent of its 2006 profit to pay out dividends. 
Eight national banks took part in a tender for an Electronic Toll Collection System ETC project, an official said here Friday.
The eight banks are Bank Mandiri, BNI, BRI, BCA, Bank Danamon, Bank Niaga, Bank Mega, and Bank BII, toll road operator PT Jasa Marga director Frans S Sunito said.
The eight banks have met the requirements for joining the tender for the Jasa Marga ETC project, he said, adding that PT Jasa Marga maintained a transparent bidding process which is free from intervention.
We will give attention to the most favorable price bid and good service, he said. 
ETC is similar to a prepaid card for toll road motorists which speeds up transactions at toll road gates.
Toll road users will no longer pay the normal toll road fees in cash, but use a prepaid card, Frans said.
The application of the ETC system will not cause a layoff, as employees can be transferred to newly built toll roads, he said.
ETC will be applied gradually.
However, these ETC system does not apply to all toll road gates, he said. 
The rupiah in the Jakarta Inter Bank Spot Market on Tuesday afternoon strengthened by seven points to Rp9,075/9,080 against the US dollar compared to Rp9,083/9,085 at the closing session on Monday after the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS announced the country was experiencing a deflation of 0.16 percent. 
Foreign exchange analyst at publicly-listed PT Bank Niaga Noel Chandra said here Tuesday BPS's announcement prompted local agents to buy rupiah causing the local unit to strengthen from its position the day before.
However, local agents purchased rupiah just before the closing session in the afternoon so that the positive sentiment did not make rupiah stay at higher position, he said.
He believed that the Indonesian currency could penetrate the level of Rp9,050 against the US dollar.
The rupiah in the past week stood at between the levels of Rp9,075 and Rp9,100 per US dollar because Bank Indonesia the central bank was still observing rupiah's movement on the market, he said.
According to him, the central bank had better let rupiah move according to the market's trend because with the strengthening position of the local unit to a certain level, the Indonesian fundamental macro economy was ameliorating.
However, the monetary authority might have other policies as the central bank controlled different interests especially those concerning the national economic growth, he said.
Thus, he said, the rupiah could not still approach the level of Rp9,050 per US dollar because Bank Indonesia would soon enter the market as the central bank had enough foreign exchange reserves.
However, the rupiah was gradually moving towards that position as the market gave positive supports in line with the world's economic growth changing from the US to Europe and Japan, he said. 
The market was also waiting for the US central bank the Fed's plan to lower its interest rate this year to boost US economic growth although the market was still worrying about the inflation rate, he said. 
The ratio of Indonesia?s debt to its gross domestic product GDP in 2006 declined to 35 percent from 47 percent in 2005, a World Bank official said here on Tuesday.
Muhammad Al Arif said he was optimistic Indonesia's debts which amounted to US$2.3 million in 2006 would continue to decrease in the future.
He said the amount of Indonesia?s debts to the World Bank during former President Soeharto's government reached US$30 billion, of which about 30 percent was allegedly embezzled by individuals in his New Order regime. 
Asked whether donors exercised any control over the use of their loans , Arif said the World Bank was trying to do so but its function and role were not the same as those of other donor institutions such as the International Monetary Fund IMF.
?The World Bank does not provide loans only but also tries its best to assist debtor countries in carrying out their development and in strengthening their administrations to enable them to keep corruption in check,? he said.
In the meantime, Peter Edward, program manager for governance of the Australian Agency for International Development AusAID, said his agency had set up three pillars to assist Indonesia in fighting corruption.
The three pillars were developing relations with Indonesia in making anti-corruption reforms, helping Indonesia reduce corruption and providing incentives to promote non-corrupt behavior.
Edward did not go into the details of the amount of AusAID assistance to Indonesia but said most of the assistance was used to finance governance reform and anti-corruption efforts.
AusAID was also concentrating on financing education programs by providing scholarships to Indonesians willing to pursue studies in various institutions in Australia.
Renaldy B Martin of the Canadian International Development Agency CIDA said meanwhile his organization was active in encouraging studies on gender equality development in Indonesia.
He said CIDA had two main programs in providing assistance to Indonesia, namely creating good governance and encouraging anti-corruption efforts. 
The government has lifted value added tax PPN on strategic goods, including primary products, in an effort to boost the development of the country's agricultural sector.
The decision to lift the PPN was based on Government Regulation No.7/2007 on the third round of amendment to Government Regulation No. 12/2001 on import/delivery of certain taxable and strategic goods but are exempted from PPN.
The Government Regulation, No.7/2007, a copy of which was made available to ANTARA here on Monday, was decreed by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on January 1, 2007.
Based on the new regulation, there are six groups of strategic products exempted from PPN.
capital goods in the form of machineries and factory equipment built-in or knocked down excluding spareparts
cattle, poultry and fish fodder/or raw fodder materials
agricultural products
seeds for agriculture, plantation, forestry, animal husbandry, breeding or fishery products
clean water distriubted through a pipeline and electricity except those with a capacity of over 6,600 watt.
On the agricultural products which are exempted from the PPN, the regulation stipulates that these products are those produced from agriculture, plantation and forestry.
South Korean share prices closed slightly higher Monday, extending gains for a third session, as foreign investors rushed to pick up financial stocks, dealers said.
The purchases effectively absorbed heavy programme selling and profit-taking by small investors, they said.
Dealers said the market was initially listless due to a mixed Friday close on Wall Street and a sense of fatigue after a nearly four percent gain in the past two sessions.
The KOSPI index ended up 4.81 points or 0.34 percent at 1,417.95, after 
moving between 1,409.71 and 1,420.42. Brokerages, insurers and utilities had strong gains.
State-owned Bank Rakyat Indonesia BRI has projected Rural Savings to increase by 15 percent and Rural Credits Kupedes by 20 percent in 2007, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises director Sulaiman Arif Arianto said.
Rural savings had reached Rp38.6 trillion while rural credits Rp43.4 trillion by December 2006, he said on the sidelines of the drawing of national Simpedes lottery here Tuesday.
The Simpedes scheme is meant for micro entrepreneurs in rural areas while Kupedes scheme for the micro, small and medium enterprises ranging from Rp5 million to Rp50 million.
As of September 2006, BRI's loan-to-deposit ratio LDR in rural areas has reached over 100 percent as the Kupedes scheme was larger than Simpedes scheme, Arianto said.
BRI's LDR was recorded at 77.7 percent, credit portofolio at Rp87 trillion, total credit for micro, small and medium enterprises at Rp76.05 trillion or Rp87.72 percent of BRI loan portofolio and third party fund at Rp112.17 trillion as of September 2006. 
As of September 2006, non-performing loans issued under the Kupedes scheme reached 1.6 percent, meaning that BRI has carried out a mandate to distribute credits to the needy only, Sulaiman said.
Under the Kupedes scheme, the total of NPLs was lower than gross NPLs amounting to 4.79 percent, the NPLs of other banks reached 7.95 percent as of September 2006.
The Asian Development Bank ADB predicts that government expenditures and investment will boost Indonesia's economic growth to 6 percent in 2007 and 6.3 percent in 2008.
It is expected that the lowering of bank interest rates will fuel investment and consumption growth, Edgar A Cua, ADB representative in Indonesia, said here on Tuesday.
Edgar A Cua made the remarks when he presented his report on the Asian Development Projection 2007.
He said that the Indonesian government should finish its reforms agenda in the coming six months and carry out infrastructure projects to attract investments.
The ADB representative also suggested that the government accomplish its unfinished regulations because in 2008 the focus of business makers would shift to the political sector in the run-up to the 2009 general elections.
The government should pay attention to legal certainty, regulations and transparency in order to attract investment, he said.
He said that the adoption of an investment law would not automatically attract foreign investment because its executing regulations must be prepared first.
In the meantime, ADB's project officer for small- and medium- scale businesses, Hari Purnomo, said that the ADB had projected Indonesia's inflation rate at 6.2 percent in 2007 and at 6.2 percent in 2008. 
This is on condition that the government would provide subsidy for electricity and consistently maintain a moderate level in food prices, particularly in the rice price.
He said gross capital investments would grow 25-27 percent of the Gross Domestic Product GDP or an increase by about 9 percent from the figure last year.
Export performance which greatly contributed to economic growth in 2006, would increase slighly in 2007 from 9.2 percent in 2006 to 10 percent in 2007.
He said the slight increase would mainly be due to slower growth in several export markets.
Market capitalization of 14 state-owned companies in the Jakarta Stock Exchange rose by almost 100 percent in the past two years from Rp250 trillion in 2004 to Rp493 trillion in 2006.
This means that the value of the firms rose by almost 100 percent, State Minister for State Firms Sugiharto said here on Monday.
He said with their capital reaching Rp493 trillion in 2006 the 14 state companies' market share reached around 40.23 percent of the total market capitalization of around 360 companies listed at the stock exchange.
So if eventuality occurs on the companies the market index will directly be corrected, he said.
As an example he cited the recent case of PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk PGN.
He said when the price of the gas distributor's shares fell early in January because the company was late to submit a report to its investors, the index at the stock exchange will immediately drop.
In view of that I must be very careful indeed in managing and producing policies for the companies, he said.
He said the sharp increase in the companies' market capitalization was the result of the improving performance of the companies and the implementation of good corporate governance in them.
The three state-owned companies that have recorded the largest market capitalization were PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk totaling Rp203.62 trillion up 17.59 pct, Bank BRI Rp62.57 trillion up 5.41 pct and Bank Mandiri Rp59.22 trillion up 5.02 pct.
The three controlled 28.02 percent of total market capitalization at the stock exchange.
The government is a mere minority shareholder in two of the 14 state companies currently listed at the Jakarta Stock Exchange namely in PT Indosat Tbk and PT Bank Bukopin Tbk.
Sugiharto said to improve their performance he had directed state companies that were considered able to compete to go public to raise funds to improve them like what he would do to PT Perkebunan Nusantara III that plans to conduct an Initial Public Offering this year to raise funds to develop crude palm oil-based industries.
Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank, has received statements of compliance from Temasek Holdings of Singapore and Khazanah Holdings of Malaysia which have controlling interests in four Indonesian banks, a BI official said. 
Yes, we have, BI Banking Research and Regulation Director Halim Alamsyah said when asked by reporters whether or not BI had received statements of compliance from Temasek and Khazanah in connection with BI's single-presence policy SPP.
Under BI's SPP foreign parties cannot own a controlling stake in more than one Indonesian bank and must submit statemensts of compliance to this rule by the end of this year. 
Khazanah, the holding company of CIMB Group, has an 86.52-percent stake in Bank Lippo through Santubong Investment BV, while CIMB Group itself owns 62 percent of Bank Niaga's shares through its subsidiary, Bumiputra Commerece. 
Meanwhile, Temasek owns 68.16 percent of Bank Danamon's shares through its subsidiary, Asia Financial, and 56.13 percent of Bank Internasional Indonesia BII's shares through its susidiary, Sorak Financial Holdings.
Halim said Bank Indonesia would study the policies of the two holding companies with regard to their share ownership in the Indonesian banks.
Senior Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia the central bank Miranda Swaray Goeltom said she expected that investment in 2008 would reach Rp1,165 trillion to meet the economic growth target of more than 6 percent. 
With the need of investment amounting to Rp1,165 trillion, banks have bigger opportunities to finance investment, she said at a function on the conferment of citations to the 2007 financial figures by a magazine in Jakarta on Tuesday. 
Currently, three fourths of investment are funded by banks, she said, adding that in 2008, banks were expected to fund more than three fourths of investment.  
Such a condition could be realized if investment on other financial markets would nor grow faster.
If the other financial markets grow better, bank funding would likely lessen, she said.
Meanwhile, she said the banking sector's growth was now ameliorating.
This can be seen from banking indicators like bank credit distribution whose year on year growth reached 24.3 percent and by the end of the year it was expected to reach 25 percent. 
The debt ratio over savings now reached 70 percent, the highest since the economic crisis 1998, while the non performing loan NPL continued to drop, she said.
Miranda said the central bank was optimistic the economic growth in 2008 would remain above six percent.
She said the economic growth in 2008 could be better than that in 2007 so that the growth in the third quarter would reach 6,3 percent.
The inflation was expected to reach between 6.3-6,5 percent by the end of this year or still within the central bank's target.       
In 2008, she believed the central bank could control the inflation due to pressure mainly from import goods. 
Capital Investment Coordination Board BKPM Chief M. Lutfi said investment in Indonesia is expected to grow by 15.2 percent in 2008 or faster than 12.54 percent as projected by the Finance Ministry.
Realization of investment in Indonesia next year will increase thanks to an expected improvement in the country's investment climate, Lutfi said when presenting a report on investment realization in the country in 2007 at the State Palace here on Tuesday.
Based on the report for the January 15 - September period, investment realization during the period totaled Rp125.95 trillion or about US$13.99 billion.
It jumped 169.02 percent from Rp74.51 trillion or US$8.28 billion in 2006.
Of the total of Rp125.94 trillion, foreign investment reached Rp91.8 trillion or US$10.20 billion.
It increased 170 percent from Rp53.73 trillion or US$5.97 billion in 2006.
Domestic investent accounted for Rp31.14 trillion or US$3.79 billion, or an increase by 164.29 percent from Rp20.78 trillion or US$2.30 billion in 2006.
Lutfi said in order to maintain the upward trend in investment realization, Indonesia needed to improve its investment climate through among others simplifying its investment services, tax reforms, fiscal facilities, excise customs, incentives and improvements in its bureaucracy in general.
Fitch Ratings said on Friday it has upgraded the national long-term rating of state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia BNI to 'AA-idn' AA minus idn from 'A+ idn.
The outlook of the rating is stable, the rating agency said in a statement.
This rating action resolves the positive outlook that BNI's national rating was placed on in September 2007. 
At the same time, Fitch has affirmed BNI's other ratings, as follow: long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings at 'BB-' BB minus with a positive outlook, short-term rating at 'B', individual rating at 'D', support rating at '4', and support rating floor at 'B+'.
The upgrade of BNI's national rating reflects its stronger capital, post its rights issue in the third quarter of 2007, its improving but still weak loan quality, generally stable but below-average profitability relative to that of its peers.
It also takes into account its majority state-ownership 76.36% and size 9.3% of system assets.
BNI raised Rp3.9 trillion in new capital in a secondary share offering in August 2007, which involved a rights issue of 1.99 billion new shares followed by a vendor sale of almost 4 billion government shares.
The rights issue increased BNI's total CAR to 17.6% at the end of September 2007 Tier-1: 13% from 15.3% at the end of 2006. However, this was still below the peer average of about 20% Tier-1: 15%.
Progress in loan restructuring and more favourable macro conditions in 2007 contributed to an improvement in loan quality.
NPLs were reduced to 8.3% of gross loans at the end of September 2007 from 10.5% at the end of 2006 and 13.7% at the end of 2005. 
In the first nine months of 2007, BNI finalised restructuring of about Rp1.3 trillion of non-performing corporate loans 1.6% of gross loans and upgraded about half to performing loans, and reduced the NPL ratio for the corporate segment to 6.4% at the end of September 2007 from 10.7% at the end of 2006.
Pre-tax ROA was stable at 1.8% in September 2007 and 2006, as higher trading and fee income offset weaker net interest income.
Net interest margins narrowed to 4.4% in September 2007 from 4.9% in 2006 partly due to higher funding costs as time deposits increased to 50% of total deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2007 from 42% at the end of 2005.
However, in the past six months ended September 2007, BNI has made the effort to cut the time deposit amount and raise the proportion of low cost savings and demand deposits, resulting in better funding mix - time deposits declined to 43% of total deposits at the end of September 2007. 
New lending has picked up, raising the share of loans to 44% of total assets at the end of September 2007 from 37% at the end of 2006.
Corporate loans remained substantial at 41% of total loans at the end of September 2007 but reduced from 72% at end-2001, reflecting increased exposure to better-yielding SME and consumer loans.
Bank Indonesia BI Senior Deputy Governor Miranda S Goeltom said the country's inflation rate in 2008 would show a downward trend and was expected to drop to below this year's figure.
Inflation next year will be lower than this year when the figure is estimated to range between 6.33 percent and 6.7 percent, Miranda said here on Thursday.
She said BI's studies on next year's inflation rate had used pessimistic assumptions such as high oil and commodity prices.
The downward trend in next year's inflation rate was one of the reasons why BI had lowered its benchmark rate from 8.25 percent to 8 percent, according to Miranda.
She said the United States subprime mortgage crisis had not affected Indonesia too much as the performance of the banking sector in the country had remained good.
We don't see that it affected Indonesia.
Data show that banking's performance remained good and is now even improving, she said.
She said banks' non-performing loans had dropped while their capital adequacy ratio CAR had increased.
With such resilience, it is just correct for BI to cut its interest rate in an effort to maintain the momentum for growth while continuing to play its stabilization role, she said.
Miranda said though there would be sluggishness in the global economy, Indonesia's economy would record high growth in 2008.
Amid the slow-down of the global economy, we are confident that Indonesia's economy will experience handsome growth at 6.3 to 6.7 percent with a mid point of 6.5 percent, she added.
Investment in Indonesia hit a 40-year record high of Rp125.94 trillion US$13.99 billion in the first nine months of 2007, the Capital Investment Coordination Board BKPM said.
Investment this year is the highest since 1967 when the capital investment law was put into force, BKPM Chief M. Lutfi said Tuesday.
Investment in 2007 consisted of foreign investment worth Rp91.8 trillion US$10.20 billion and domestic investment worth Rp31.14 trillion US$3.79 billion, he said.
Foreign investment jumped 170 percent from last year when it was Rp53.73 trillion US$5.97 billion, while domestic investment climbed 164.29 percent from Rp20.78 trillion US$2.30 billion last year, he said.
The 2007 investment figure is the result of the improved investment climate at home, he said.
He said paper, paper-related goods and plastic industries were the biggest recipient of domestic investment in 2007 with the funds sunk in those industries 8 projects totaling Rp14.54 trillion. 
Food industry came in second with Rp5.13 trillion invested in 24 projects, he said.
Trailing behind in third place were base metal, machinery and electronic industries in which 17 projects absorbed a total of Rp3.54 trillion in funds, he said.
Meanwhile, the transportation, warehousing, and telecommunication sectors took the biggest amount of foreign investment with Rp29.61 trillion in 41 projects.
This was followed by base chemical, chemical goods and pharmaceutical industries where 32 projects absorbed a total of Rp14.49 trillion.
West Java topped the list of domestic investment destinations with a value of Rp11.26 trillion in 33 projects, followed by Jambi Rp4.47 trillion in 2 projects, Jakarta Rp4.19 trillion in 32 projects, Riau Rp3.09 trillion in 11 projects, and Southeast Sulawesi Rp2.76 trillion in 1 project.
Jakarta remained the most attractive destination to foreign investment with Rp41.94 trillion in 349 projects, followed by East Java Rp15.2 trillion in 62 projects, West Java Rp11.81 trillion in 240 projects, Riau Rp6.51 trillion in 10 projects, and Banten Rp5.81 trillion in 76 projects.
Middle Eastern businessmen are keen to invest in Indonesia without any hidden agenda, the chairman of the Indonesian Syaria Bank Association Asbisindo, M Riawan Amin, said here Thursday.
With their huge funds, they will leave the US and the European Union, and are ready to enter Asia, including Indonesia, for business without any political agenda, Riawan told ANTARA.
As the world's largest Muslim country with the same cultural background Indonesia should take the opportunity, he added.
Citing an example, he said the Islamic Development Bank IDB had provided US$10 billion in funds for poverty eradication through payment of tithes.
IDB is a stakeholder in Bank Muamalat Indonesia BMI.
However, the Middle Eastern businessman's plan to invest in Indonesia could not be realized soon due to the absence of a law on Sukuk obligation in Islamic law, rampant corruption and double taxation risks.
We will have to do many things to attract them.
Moreover, syariah banking has yet to become a national agenda, Riawan said.
Some Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong had become main competitors to Indonesia in attracting investment from the Middle East, he noted.
Singapore and Hong Kong which had different cultural background with the Middle East, are planning to be centers for syariah banking.
Malaysia had offered facilities, including tax incentives, to lure Middle Eastern investors.
To date, Indonesian investment in the Middle East is made through third parties such as Singapore.
Riawan , who is also president director of Bank Muamalat Indonesia BMI, said the bank's presence was expected to lessen investors' doubts about Indonesia's business potentials and prospects.
The bank's customers had increased from 1.2 million in 2006 to 1.7 million in 2007.
Individuals' savings at the bank increased from Rp6.8 trillion to Rp8.2 trillion during the same period.
State telecommunication operator Indosat said on Thursday its net profit in the first nine months of 2007 jumped 56 percent to Rp1.445 trillion from a year earlier. 
Operating income in the nine months ended Sept 30 stood at Rp11.88 trillion, propping up operating profit to Rp3.204 trillion, President Director Johnny Swandi Sjam said.
The company's operating income and operating profit grew 34 percent and 31 percent respectively compared to the same period last year, he said.
Cellular services, fixed data services multimedia, internet and data communication services and fixed telephone services contributed 77 percent, 13 percent and 10 percent respectively to the company's operating income, he said.
Operating income from cellular services grew 38 percent compared to the same period last year with the number of cellular subscribers rising 54.8 percent to 22 million.
Meanwhile, operating income from fixed data services grew 11 percent to Rp1.568 trillion and that from fixed phone services 43 percent to Rp1.165 trillion compared to the same period last year.
Indonesian credit rating agency Pefindo has affirmed its idA ratings for Bank Jabar's bonds IV/2004 of Rp1 trillion and bonds V/2006 of Rp1 trillion.
Outlook for those ratings remained stable , Pefindo said in a statement issued on Friday.
The ratings reflected the bank's strong and growing market position, superior asset quality, and potentially improving capitalization after initial public offering IPO scheduled for the first quarter of 2008, it said.
However, those strengths had been offset by the bank's concentrated funding sources and tough competition in the banking industry, it said.
Established on May 20, 1961, Bank Jabar is currently the country's largest regional development bank with 133 offices mostly located in West Java and Banten provinces.
As of the first half of 2007, the bank was 81 percent owned by the West Java provincial government and 19 percent by the Banten provincial government.
A synergy between Bank Indonesia BI and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kadin can speed up the resurrection of business world notably micro, small and medium enterprises UMKM, central bank Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah has said.
Burhanuddin made the statement after he signed a memorandum of understanding to set up Kadin-BI cooperation forum FK2BI on the sidelines of a Kadin's national leadership meeting.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and some ministers witnessed the signing of the MoU between BI governor Burhanuddin Abdullah and Kadin chairman MS Hidayat.
The central bank has targeted that total UMKM credit expansion will reach Rp87.62 trillion in 2007, Rp98.3 trillion in 2008, and Rp117.96 trillion in 2009.
A BI survey showed UMKM credit was 65 percent targeted for trade and service companies and 35 percent for manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
Developing of UMKM sector should be focused on manufacturing and agricultural affairs that the micro small and medium business can play bigger role in boosting economic growth and in creating job fields, he said.
Therefore, Bank Indonesia will make consultation forums with business sectors and banks as well as develop BI offices into business and economic information centers in regions, Burhanuddin said. 
Bank Indonesia, he said, will likewise empower credit information bureau in a bid to increase banking risk management capability and risk assessment effectiveness including BI regulation amendment on intermediation function development. 
Meanwhile, state Bank Mandiri director Agus Martowardoyo said his office welcomes the information cooperation between BI and Kadin as it will facilitate monitoring system on banks and certain clients notably UMKMs which are grouped in Kadin. 
The rupiah in the Jakarta inter-bank spot market on Monday morning weakened by 50 points to Rp9,170/9,175 from Rp9,120/9,140 against the US dollar over the weekend as market players rushed to buy dollars.
The rupiah could still not reach the level of Rp9,100 per dollar, a foreign exchange analyst of PT Bank Saudara a private bank, Rully Nova, said here Monday, adding that if the rupiah strengthened on Monday it might weaken on Tuesday.
However, he said, the local unit was still in a stable position as it had remained in a range between Rp9,100 and Rp9,200 against the US dollar. 
He sad its was still possible for the rupiah to appreciate with the stable position of Bank Indonesia the central bank's interest rate at 8.25 percent and The Fed's plan to lower its interest rate later this month.   
We are optimistic that the rupiah will return to the level of Rp9,000 per US dollar if The Fed lowers its interest rate again, he said. 
He further said the rupiah should actually have strengthened to less than Rp9,100 against the US currency as a result of BI's efforts to curb the inflation rate which had tended to increase.  
If the rupiah strengthens, the cost of imports will decrease and thus offset the increase in world crude oil prices, he said.
He said the government had better reduce its subsidy cost to zero percent so that it would not burden the state budget and the rupiah would not be pressured further.

The Indonesian National Importers Association GINSI is uncertain about the government implementing the National Single Window NSW system or integrated inspection of imported goods as of December this year.
I am uncertain about the implementation of NSW system beginning in December 2007, GINSI chairman Amiruddin Suad told ANTARA here on Monday.
Amiruddin was responding to a statement made recently by director general of customs and excise of the Finance Ministry, Anwar Suprijadi, that the implementation of NSW had been postponed until December from March as originally planned.
Anwar Suprijadi, former state minister for administrative reforms, said the postponement was intended to enable customs and excise authorities to make better preparations.
However, the GINSI chairman said the postponement was chiefly caused by unreadiness of various institutions outside the Directorate General of Customs and Excise such as the Food and Drug Control Board, the Health Ministry, the Trade Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry's quarantine.
The Food and Drug Control Board has so far been responsible for deciding whether or not certain food and drug could be imported from Indonesia's trade partners.
The jobs of those institutions should have been combined with the NSW system, Amiruddin Suad said, adding that importers had to report to various institutions if they wanted to import goods.
He pointed out that if an importer wanted to import food or medicine, he or she should report it to the Food and Drug Control Board.
Amiruddin Suad said the NSW system had been applied in a number of countries, including Singapore.
The NSW system we apply is similar to that in Singapore, and in reality the flow of imported goods into the country runs smoothly, Amiruddin said. 
Asked if the postponement has hampered inspection of imported goods by customs and excise officers, Amiruddin said there was no problem because it used Electronic Data Interchange EDI system. 
Telecommunication company Mobile-8 and Samsung Electronics have signed a cooperation agreement to develop telecommunication networks in many regions in Indonesia, a spokesperson said.

Mobile-8 will embark on the construction of new infrastructure in the first quarter of this year.
We are optimistic that the project will be completed on time and will raise the number of our subscribers by four million by the end of this year, she said.
Sintawati expressed hope that the cooperation with Samsung Electronics will expand the Mobile-8 service area on Java and Bali islands from 70 percent in 2006 to 90 percent in 2007 as well as from 42 percent in 2006 to 70 percent in 2007 around the country.
Indonesia's tax receipts in the two months ended on Feb 28 reached Rp40 trillion-Rp50 trillion out of the target of Rp452.556 trillion for 2007, a Finance Ministry official said.
The tax receipts came from value added tax and income tax, exclusive of foreign exchange receipts, the ministry's director general of state treasury, Herry Purnomo, said on Monday.
Excise receipts in the first two months of 2007 meanwhile exceeded Rp10 trillion, he said.
However, the state budget spending on goods fell short of expectation, reaching about 5 percent, he said.
Overall, the state budget is still manageable as spending is low, he said.
Under Law No.18/2006 on the 2007 State Budget, the government and the House of Representatives are expecting a 23.51 percent rise in tax receipts in 2007 to Rp452.556 trillion from the target set in the 2006 State Budget.
The expected tax receipts will consist of Rp261.698 trillion from income tax, Rp161.044 trillion from value added tax, Rp21.267 trillion from property tax, Rp5.389 trillion from receipts from land and building titles and Rp3.157 trillion from other taxes.
Heavy-duty equipment provider PT Apexindo Pratama Duta APEX has won a US$13.9-million contract on a number of onshore drilling projects to be carried out over a period of six months, a spokesperson said.
The contract is an extension of an earlier one in which the company provided onshore drilling services for two VICO rigs, namely Rig 9 and Rig 10, in East Kalimantan, APEX director Hertriono Kartowisastro told the Jakarta Stock Exchange here Thursday.
He said APEX had also won three other contracts to carry out domestic drilling activities.
The three contracts comprised a $1.6 million commitment for a project in Tungkal in Jambi province, $2.5 million from Lundin Blora BV to drill rig 8 and $3.5 million from JOB Pertamina and Medco Tomori to drill rig 2 in Tomori block, Sulawesi.
Our success in getting the four contracts shows the on-shore drilling market in Indonesia is quite promising, he said. 
Until recently, APEX's business mostly involved offshore drilling projects.
APEX will continue to participate actively in both onshore and offshore drilling project tenders in order to strengthen its position as a leading drilling contractor, Hertriono said.
Bank Indonesia will ease its monetary rules including lowering the BI Rate and loosening conditions for application of credits to improve the banks' intermediary role to boost economic developement, the central bank governor, Burhanuddin Abdullah, said here on Thursday.
To facilitate it, some regulations would be relaxed, he said after meeeting with Vice President Jusuf Kalla and banking officials.
The meeting was also attended by Coordinating Minister for Economy Boediono, State Minister for State Firms Sugiharto and chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kadin MS Hidayat.
Regarding the BI Rate, Burhanuddin said BI would monitor closely internal and external developments including the development of inflation. If it is still possible, BI would lower the BI Rate after monitoring month-to-month developments, he said.
He said beginning on April 1 several monetary regulations would issued.
Unlike before, he said the provision of credits to micro-, small- and medium-scale businesses would later be based only upon repayment and timely payment capability. At present credits are provided on the basis of three pillars namely repayment and timely payment capability, in addition to business prospects and financial condition of debtors.
effective as of April 1, banks are already able to start implementing it now, Burhanuddin said.
The credits for small- and medium-scale businesses have been raised from a maximum of Rp500 million to Rp20 billion for four banks that have a strong risk management. Burhanuddin declined to name the banks.
He said the total of 98 banks with acceptable risk management would be allowed to provide a maximum of Rp1 billion per customer to enable them to net not only small but also medium customers.
Burhanuddin said companies that had problems caused by macro-economic conditions, crisis and others would now be allowed to seek credits again.
He said the government, the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Bank Indonesia would see which sectors would be focused on development.
There are 10 sectors that have been on the talk.
What is urgent is infrastructure.
Others will be discussed later.
All the regulations, God willing, will be completed on April 1, he said.
State-owned pharmaceutical company PT Kimia Farma Persero Tbk KAEF here on Friday announced that its net profit in 2006 dropped to Rp43.99 billion, or by 16.73 percent, from Rp52.83 billion in 2005.
The company's annual financial report showed that the decrease in its net profit was mainly due to an increase in its operational cost.
The company's net sales, in fact, increased from Rp1.82 trillion in 2005 to Rp2.19 trillion in 2006.
However, the gross profits of Kimia Farma decreased from Rp84.72 billion to Rp60.63 billion. 
Last year, the pharmaceutical company also gained an additional net income amounting to Rp7 billion, an improvement compared to the situation in 2005, when the company had to bear additional expenses worth Rp2.23 billion.
However, due to the decrease in its net profit, the company's Earning Per Share EPS also dropped from Rp9.51 to Rp7.92.
Meanwhile, Kimia Farma's share in yesterday's trading at the Jakarta Stock Exchange JSE was closed at Rp166 per share. 
Data on five percent or more share holders from the Jakarta Stock Exchange on January 31, 2007, showed that the Indonesian Government was still the majority share holder of PT Kimia Farma Tbk, namely 90.03 percent. 
PT Wahana Ottomitra Multiartha WOM Finance Tbk, an automotive finance company, here on Friday launched a public offer of WOM Finance's Obligation IV for 2007 worth up to Rp1 trillion at a fixed interest rate.

The number of each series of the bonds and the interest coupon would be determined later, the company said.
The offer of the bonds will take place from May 4 to 8, 2007 and will be listed in the Surabaya Stock Exchange SSE on May 24, 2007.

Publicly-listed cement maker PT Holcim Indonesia Tbk, formerly PT Semen Cibinong Tbk, announced on Friday it posted a net consolidated profit of Rp175.94 billion last year after suffering a loss of Rp334.08 billion a year earlier.
The company's annual financial statement shows the net profit was mostly fueled by net miscellaneous income rather than by operational income.
Net sales fell to Rp2.993 trillion in 2006 from Rp3.017 trillion the year before and accordingly, gross profit dropped to Rp637.16 billion from Rp719.59 billion.
Operational profit plunged to Rp6.18 billion from Rp143.09 billion due to a surge in operating expenses.
By Dec 31, 2006, the company's current liabilities totaled Rp855.82 billion, up from Rp665.35 billion in the same period of 2005, while its current assets fell to Rp1.049 trillion from Rp1.114 trillion.
Its total equities rose to Rp2.099 trillion in the year ended on Dec 31, 2006 compared to Rp1.842 trillion in the same period of 2005.
However, its total assets declined to Rp7.065 trillion from Rp7.324 trillion. 
To achieve the government's 6.3 economic growth target this year, the investment growth rate should reach 12.3 percent, Finance Minsiter Sri Mulyani Indrawati said. 
According to our calculations, if we want our economic growth to reach 6.3 percent in 2007, investment should grow by 12.3 percent, the minister said here on Friday.
She said the desired investment growth figure could be reached if public consumption grew by 5.1 percent, government consumption/expenditure by 8.9 percent and exports increased by 9.9 percent as in 2006.
Export growth in 2006 was quite good but the reverse had happened with investment growth, she said. 
Investment growth is, indeed, related to the real sector.
The real sector's growth reached only 12.91 percent last year compared with 10.8 percent to 2005, she said. 
She said to date the manufacturing sector had contributed much to investment growth at home but in the past two years 2005 and 2006, the sector only grew by 4.6 percent and 4.7 percent.
The manufacturing sector is traditionally the main contributor to investment growth.
Besides, the sector also provides many job opportunities, she said.
Before the 1998 crisis, the manufacturing sector's growth exceeded 8 percent but to support economic growth of above 6 percent in 2007, the sector should grow by at least 7.2 percent, she said.
And thus, to support investment growth of 12.3 percent, investment should be channeled to the manufacturing sector and other sectors such as construction, trade, hotels and restaurants and transportation, she added.
Sri further said to reach investment growth of 12.3 percent, a fixed capital gross of Rp989 trillion would be needed.
The government along with some state companies BUMN through its public private partnership PPP program would contribute some 35 percent of the amount, she added.
The banking sector, meanwhile, was expected to contribute some Rp96 trillion-Rp100 trillion or some 60 percent, she added.
The rest was expected to come from foreign and local capital investment through the money market and others, she said.
PT Bank Mandiri BMRI is preparing a credit scheme worth Rp11 trillion to help finance investment in the plantation sector in the 2007-2010 period, a BMRI director said here on Friday.
Director for Micro & Retail Banking Affairs of BMRI, Budi Gunardi, said in press statment that the funds would among others be used to develop 321,268 hectares of oil palm plantations.
According to Budi, the Rp11 trillion could meet the need for credit of 80,000 plasm farmers.
Besides, oil palm plantations, the credits were also intended to develop ccoa and rubber plantations. 
Up to now, the amount of credits Bank Mandiri had provided reached Rp14.39 trillion, of which Rp11.3 trillion were provided for large-scale plantations and people's nucleus plantations while Rp3.09 trillion had been extended to cooperatives and plasm farmers.
The bank had also distributed Rp7.14 trillion in credits to industries processing plantation products.
Bank Mandiri's credits for plantations accounted for 36.43 percent of the country's total credits for the plantation sector, which, based on Bank Indonesia data, reached Rp39.5 trillion.
The president director of state-owned Bank Mandiri, Agus Martowardoyo, said here on Friday he was optimistic the growth of the bank's credits would surpass the 20 percent target following the government's plan to ease the requirements for obtaining credits. 
We plan to conduct a budgetary revision in June.
If the condition is as it is now, synchronization has to be done.
Increase in the number of credits may surpass 20 percent, he said on the sidelines of a seminar on agrobusiness.
Bank Mandiri may move from micro-businesses to corporations.
In short it may enter into all segments.
In every segment we expect to be able to control 25 to 30 percent of the market, he said.
Regarding credits in the first quarter, he predicted that credit distribution would likely be slow because of the recent disasters such as floods.
We hope things would be better in the second quarter, he said.
On the occasion, he said Bank Mandiri had provided credits worth Rp11 trillion to finance investment in the plantation sector for 2007 to 2010.
Bank Mandiri's director of micro and retail banking Budi Gunardi said the funds would be used for the development of 321,268 hectares of people's oil palm plantations that would be distributed in stages according to needs.
He said the funds would be for 80,000 farmers.
The plantations to be financed include oil palm, cacao and rubber plantations, he said.
Until now the bank has distributed Rp14.39 trillion to the plantation sector.
Bank Mandiri's credits for the plantation sector had reached 36.43 percent of the national credits to the sector reaching Rp39.5 trillion, Bank Indonesia said.
Budi was optimistic the plantation business would develop considering the smooth repayment of the credits involved.
So far the repayment of credits in the oil palm plantation sector has been smooth.
The percentage of non-performing loans in this sector is relatively small compared to the NPLs in other sectors, he said.
The inflation rate in March will be 0.5 prcent or slghtly lower than in February when the figure was recorded at 0.62 percent, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said. 
It is a public secret that if the rice price is under control, the inflation rate will not rise.
I see the inflation rate in March will not be higher than in the previous month.
The prices of other commodities seem not to fluctuate too much either, BPS Head Rusman Herawan said at the Finance Ministry here Tuesday.
Rusman said that the rice price in the third week of March, 2007, had tended to decrease compared to that in the second week of the same month although it was still on a high level.
On the average, the rice price is still high nationally, namely, Rp6,000 per kg, he said.
In the fourth week of March, 2007, there were indications that the rice price would drop although not significantly but it would much influence the inflation rate, he said.
Rusman said other than rice, there was no commodity whose price had fluctuated until now.
Let's see the prices of non-rice commodities.
The price of sugar cane, for instance, seems to decrease and there is no indication that the sugar price will increase.
I think March is the most quiet month in terms of inflation among other things, he said.
BPS recorded the inflation rate in February 2007 at 0.62 percent and the year-on-year inflation rate was recorded at 6.30 percent, while based on the calendar year, the inflation rate was 1.67 percent.
In January, 2007, the inflation rate was recorded at 1.04 percent on a month-to-month basis and it was 6.26 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Publicly-listed instant noodle maker PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Tbk said on Wednesday it will issue Rp1.5 trillion worth of five-year bonds in May mainly to repay its dollar-denominated debts.
Indofood will use 62 percent of the proceeds from its bond issuance to repay its debts amounting to US$100 million, the company said in a condensed prospectus.
The remaining 38 percent, around Rp570 billion, will be used to repay its rupiah-denominated bank borrowings.
The bonds will be offered to the public on May 1-3 and listed at the Surabaya Stock Exchange on May 10.
The company has appointed PT Mandiri Securities, PT Danareksa, PT Trimegah Securities and PT Danatama Makmur as underwriters of the bond issuance.
International rating agency Standard & Poor's Rating Services said a divestment of PT Medco Energi Internasional MEDC's subsidiary, PT Medco E&P Brantas, will not affect the company's rating and prospects.
Medco announced last week it agreed on a plan to sell all its stake in Medco Brantas to Prakarsa Group at US$100, S&P said here Wednesday.
Medco Brantas controls 32 percent of Brantas gas block concession.
Brantas block is a gas well in Porong area, East Java, which has been spewing hotmud since May last year.
The mudflow has inundated many villages and farmland in Porong area as well as rendered hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
S&P said the sale of Medco Brantas will end the uncertainty in Medco's final obligation concerning the uncontrollable mudflow.
Medco has prepared $22 million in the third quarter of 2006 to cope with the mudflow.
Medco hoped that it will no longer be bothered with problems stemming from the mudflow following the sale of Medco Brantas.
According to S&P, Medco's rating is still negative due to its increasing debt.
The international rating agency, however, stated that Medco may have a good prospect as long as it raises its reserve and production as well as secured a guarantee for its latest contract. 
The Japanese government has already provided the Indonesian government with 99.811 billion yen or Rp7.718 trillion in loan, the Japanese Embassy said in a dispatch made available here Wednesday.
The loan which was approved by the Japanese Embassy's charge d'affaires ad-interim Satoru Satoh and Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry's management expert staff M. Ibnu Said on March 28 was designed to finance nine infrastructure projects in the country, the statement said.
The agreement on the new loan brought the Japanese loan to Indonesia to 4.166 trillion yen or Rp322.127 trillion, it said.
The loan is payable in 30 to 40 years and carries a 0.4 to 1.5 percent interest. 
The government has set the deficit in the 2008 state budget at 1.7 percent or around Rp73.1 trillion of the gross domestic product GDP which is estimated at Rp753.7 trillion assuming economic growth reaches 6.8 percent, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said.
The minister announced the government's decision after a cabinet meeting led by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono at the State Secretariat here on Wednesday.
Almost all cabinet members as well as senior officials of ministries and other government institutions attended the meeting.
Sri Mulyani said the government had set the 2008 budget and other macro-economic figures based on government working plans and projections made in the 2007 state budget.
The projection of economic growth in 2007 which is set at 6.3 percent is a heavy challenge although until today almost all quarters think growth could only reach around 6.1 percent.
It indeed needs hard work, she said.
She said if the rate of inflation in 2007 was predicted to reach 6.5 to seven percent it was expected to be lower or around six percent in 2008.
The exchange rate of the country's currency was also expected to remain stable at Rp9,300 against the US dollar while the BI Rate was expected to continue to drop to between 7.5 and 8 percent from around 8 to 8.5 percent now in line with a downward rend in the inflation rate. 
The government had set the crude oil price at around US$57 per barrel in the 2008 state budget with the country's oil production reaching 1.034 million barrels per day or up from 1.015 million barrels per day in 2007.
So foreign exchange reserves in 2008 are predicted to reach Rp60 trilion, she said.
Regarding income from taxes, the minister said the government hoped the tax ratio in 2008 would reach 13.5 percent of GDP, down from 14.4 percent projected for the 2007 budget.
She said the drop followed a change in the calculation bases for determining the GDP.
The Central Bureau of Statistics revised the GDP figures from 2000 to 2006 so that the GDP had increased from Rp3,531 trillion to Rp3,796 or by around Rp250 trilion.
This will cause the tax ratio to decline because the numerator is higher.
For 2007 the tax ratio is expected to reach 13.8 percent of the GDP but under the new system it will be around 12.9 percent, she said.
Regarding expenditures, she said they were estimated to reach Rp826.9 trillion in 2008 with government spending reaching Rp559 trillion rising from Rp504.8 trillion in 2007 and regional government expenditures reaching Rp267.9 trillion up from Rp258.8 trillion.
The increases would happen because the expenditures of government ministries and other government offices continued to rise every year.
In 2005, they reached Rp121 trillion but in 2006 they rose by 76.8 percent to Rp214 trillion.
In 2007 they were set at Rp258 trillion and in 2008 they were projected to reach Rp280 trillion.
The Indonesian government has set its economic growth target for 2008 at 6.8 percent or higher than its growth forecast of 6.3 percent for 2007, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said.
To achieve the growth target, we must boost household consumption, state consumption, exports and imports, Sri Mulyani said after a meeting on the government's work plans at the State Secretariat here on Wednesday. 
But she added the government would find it quite hard to achieve the economic growth target of 6.3 percent for this year.
This will also be an extra duty for the government in the sense that it has already set the growth target at a higher level than the average projection, she said.
She said household consumption, state consumption, investment, exports and imports would serve as the main engine of economic growth in 2008.
Household consumption in 2008 must grow by 5.9 percent compared to the growth forecast of 5.1 percent for 2007, she said.
Normally, household consumption can reach about 61 percent of the gross domestic product GDP, she said.
Likewise, state consumption would hopefully grow by 8.9 percent next year from the growth projection of 6.2 percent this year, she said.
Investment was expected to grow by 15.5 percent next year from the growth forecast of 12.3 percent
Meanwhile, exports were expected to grow by 12.7 percent next year from the growth projection of 9.9 percent this year, she said.
She said at least three factors would impede the attainment of the 6.8 percent growth target for 2008, namely declining risk resulting from global economic growth, frequent natural disasters at home and fluctuations in global oil and commodity prices.
The government has predicted that the deficit of the 2007 budget will rise from 1.1 to 1.5 percent, or two percent from Rp60 to Rp65 trillion, of the total gross domestic product GDP.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said after a cabinet meeting chaired by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono here on Wednesday that this year's economic growth was expected to reach 6.3 percent. 
She said a number of factors had contributed to the rise in the budget deficit such as rising expenditures in the wake of the floods and carry-over subsidies.
She said the acceleration of payments of delayed tax payments would also reduce the state's income by around Rp12 trillion.
These are some of the factors that might affect projections for the 2007 budget.
We do not know the exact figures as we are still monitoring the income and expenditures, she said.
Total budget of 2007 reached Rp723.1 trillion with government expenditures amounting to Rp763.6 trillion, or a deficit of Rp40.5 trillion.
In terms of income, the tax ratio for the 2007 budget has been projected at 14.4 percent of the gross domestic product.
This will be an extra job for the government.
The government has deliberately set a target higher than general projections, she said.
She said to meet the target, consumption by households should grow by 5.1 percent, by government by 8.9 percent, investment by 12.3 percent, exports by 9.9 percent and imports by 14.2 percent.

The Bank Indonesia BI or Central Bank, in cooperation with the Finance Ministry and the Deposit Guarantee Agency LPS, plans to set up a body to deal with possible instability in the country's financial system, a spokesman said.
Early next month, we will sign a joint decree for the establishment of a Forum for Financial System Stability FSSK, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Mulyaman D Hadad said at a seminar here on Monday.
The issue of financial stability had become a priority as Indonesia was a country that was receiving capital inflows from the current excess in global liquidity, he said.
He said the forum would be a formal crisis management institution in the country.
Hadad said although a lot of foreign capital had come into the country, the situation now was different from when foreign capital flowed into the country in 1997.
The country's economic condition now is better than 10 years ago.
We now have better macro-economic stability and a larger amount of foreign exchange reserves.
Still, we have to remain alert towards a possible disruption in our currency, he said.
He said apart from establishing the FSSK, Bank Indonesia was continuing to issue regulations, increase research and surpervision to identify and monitor possible risks that could threaten financial stability and taking preventive measures to avoid a crisis and find solutions to a possible crisis. 
Meawnhile, LPS chief executive Krisna Wijaya said on the occasion that other countries had already created a safety valve to overcome a possible financial crisis.
They had done so considering that past crises had caused their governments to bear huge fiscal cost burdens.
Quoting several economic experts, he said, Indonesia used 58 percent of its gross domestic product GDP to finance its financial crisis in 1997-1998.
This is the highest among crisis-hit countries in the world.
The crisis in Argentina that has often been considered to have brought a big impact only took 55 percent of that country's GDP to settle, he said.
Therefoe, he said, it was important to have a better financial risk management to overcome similar crises.
One of the ways is a deposit guarantee.

The rupiah at the Jakarta Inter Bank Spot Market on Tuesday afternoon strengthened to 8,975/8,980 per US dollar from 9,028/9,065 the day before or an improvement by 63 points.
Foreign exchange analyst with PT Bank Niaga, Noel Chandra, said here Tuesday purchasing of rupiah increased in the afternoon causing the local unit to strengthen drastically. 
However, according to Chandra, market agents also worried about the Japanese central bank's decision to increase its interest rate next August. 
If the Japanese central bank BoJ really raised its interest rates, market agents would buy yen in regional markets and it would eventually lead the rupiah to continue to strengthen, he said.  
The BoJ would this week hold a meeting to discuss interest rates and the market situation which had not not yet become bullish.     
We expect the rupiah to keep on strengthening as the market's positive sentiment still continues, he said.  
The market was now also watching the US central bank the Fed which would lower its interest rate, and worrying about the increasing inflation rate. 
He said the improvment in the rupiah's rate was also supported by the improving internal market conditions among others due to the decreasing number of rallies in the hope more foreign investors would enter the domestic market as the investment climate at home was improving. 
The Indonesian currency appreciated also because of the improving regional share market due to the strengthening Wall Street stock exchange despite worries that the global economy would adversely affect the share market, he said.  
The National Development Planning Agency Bappenas will cancel foreign-funded projects worth US$6-7 billion approved since 2000 as their execution had fallen short of expectations, an official said. 
The projects have not performed as expected due to slugggish fund absorption as a consequence of such problems as land disputes, Bappenas chief Paskah Suzetta said in a dialog with the rector of Padang State University UNP, Mawardi Effendi, here on Wednesday.
He said the government was determined to combine foreign and domestic funding sources to finance development projects in the future.
The combination of domestic and foreign funding sources is designed to avoid having to seek offshore loans such as those from multilateral and bilateral institutions that usually apply binding contracts, he said.
In 2007, the government would disburse offshore loans worth US$1.7 billion out of US$4 billion agreed to by the House of Representatives DPR.
Some of the loans would originate from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Japan Bank of International Cooperation.

Import duty receipts in the first semester of 2007 reached Rp7.3 trillion, representing 51 percent of the target of Rp14.4 trillion for that year, he said.

Japanese investors hoped that the implementation of regional autonomy in North Sulawesi would provide conducive climate for investment in the province, North Sulawesi Governor Sinyo Harry Sarundajang said here on Thursday.
We have to acknowledge some still believe that economic reforms have yet to be fully implemented in Indonesia but I have ascertained that North Sulawesi is serious in cutting down various bureaucratic procedures and rullings which hamper investment, the governor said.

Rullings made by the central government met with different implementation in provinces following the introduction of regional autonomy.
In the meeting we also discuss which projects that can get Japanese assistance through the JICA.
JICA has expressed readiniess to facilitate the flow of investment to North Sulawesi, the governor said.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the banking world's Consultative Paper of the New Basel Capital Accord or better known as Basel II should be applied with the purpose of creating equitable national prosperity. 
If the application of the system impedes disbursement of credits for the purchase of sugarcane and paddy seeds or for micro and small businesses, we had better abandon it, Kalla said before opening a national seminar on the application of Basel II and its impact on the consolidation of the national banking industry here.
Application of Basel II was not a goal but merely a means to help achieve the country's goal of improving the people's welfare and prosperity in a fair manner, he said.
The vice president said domestic banks must be able to compete with foreign ones so as not to allow the latter to gain control over the domestic banking industry.
Therefore, he added, Basel II must be applied with a high degree of nationalist ardor and in conjunction with adequate improvements in the banking industry's management system so that the industry can optimally peform its function in pursuit of conducive economic growth. 
He said application of Basel II must include provision of credits for farmers, fishermen and micro and small entrepreneurs who had been serving as the pillars of the economy since the monetary crisis engulfed the country in 1997.
Today, the national economy still relies on the grass-roots.
That's why the global banking system must accommodate our national needs such as the provision of credits for micro and small businesses, he said.
The size of a bank cannot be measured by the value of its assets but by its performance in extending credits to the public to create prosperity, he said. 
Basel II is the second of the Basel Accords which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
The final version aims to ensure that capital allocation is more risk sensitive; separating operational risk from credit risk, and quantifying both; attempting to align economic and regulatory capital more closely to reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage. 
Bank Indonesia the central bank is planning to apply the Basel II to all commercial banks in stages starting in 2008.
In implementing Basel II, the central bank will pursue two different approaches, namely standardized approach and basic indicator approach.
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, on Thursday cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 8.25 percent, citing continuing improvements in the county's macro-economic conditions.
The decision to cut the rate was made following a comprehensive assessment of economic developments and prospects that are showing signs of improvement, Bank Indonesia Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said after a meeting of the central bank's board of governors here.
He said the cut in the key rate, locally known as BI Rate, was also based on the likehood of the country hitting its full-year inflation targets of 6, plus and minus 1 percent for 2007, and of 5, plus and minus 1 percent, for 2008.
The results of a study conducted by the central bank suggested that inflationary pressure had shown signs of abating in recent months, he said. 
On a yearly basis, the consumer price index inflation and the core inflation rates in the second quarter of 2007 stood at 5.77 percent and 5.4 percent respectively, he said.
Inflation had slowed as the prices of volatile foods reported deflation despite an increase in the prices of several commodities.
Burhanuddin said the core inflation rate still tended to decline due to easing external pressure and adequate supplies to meet demand.
He expressed hope that the cut in the key rate, the 13th since last May, would give the business world more access to low-interest bank loans.
Indonesia's balance of payments in the second quarter of 2007 recorded a surplus of US$3.7 billion, Bank Indonesia said.
Preliminary data show that the balance of payments in the second quarter of 2007 recorded a surplus of US$3.7 billion, surpassing the initial projection of US$1.1 billion, Bank Indonesia Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah told a press conference here Thursday.
The higher-than-expected balance of payments had raised the country's foreign exchange reserves to US$51 billion in the month ending on June 30, 2007, he said.
The foreign exchange reserves were enough to finance imports and foreign debt repayments for 5.2 months, he said.
He said the rupiah which appreciated by an average of 1.5 percent to Rp8,968 per dollar in the second quarter of 2007 from Rp9,102 per dollar a quarter earlier had raised the balance of payment. 
The rupiah's appreciation was also fueled by positive developments in fundamental factors as reflected by improved balance of payments, attractive yields on the rupiah, and manageable risk factors, he said.
Taxation Director General Darmin Nasution said the country's tax receipts in the first semester of 2007 increased 20.75 percent to Rp191 trillion compared with those in a corresponding period in 2006.
The 20.75 percent increase exceeds the average 18.8 percent rise in tax receipts over the past five years, Darmin said here on Thursday.
He said realization of tax revenue from the oil and gas sector in the first semester of this year stood atRp171 trillion or an increase by Rp20.2 trillion if compared with the same period in 2006 when the figure was Rp141.5 trillion.
Darmin said tax receipts in the second quarter of this year came slower than in the first quarter due to the payment of restitution arrears worth Rp15 trillion, consisting of Rp7 trillion in last year's arears and Rp8 trilion in current year arrears.
The slow-tax receipts also happened because of a fall in deposit interest receipts following the decline in the deposit interest rate which was marked by improvements in the country's macro-economic indicators.
Besides, law inflation had also caused a decline in value-added tax receipts.
The director general also said the realization of tax revenues in 2007 was expected to drop by Rp19 trillion to Rp20 trillion from the target set in the 2007 state budget.
PT Perusahaan Pengelola Aset PPA, state-owned asset management company, will sell the government's stakes in insurance firm PT Asuransi Tugu Pratama Indonesia and reinsurance firm PT Tugu Reasuransi Indonesia late September.
At the end of the third quarter we will conduct public offering, PT PPA President Director M Syarial said following a working meeting with the House of Representatives DPR on Monday night.
Syarial said PT PPA would lobby state oil and gas firm Pertamina to also sell its stake in PT Asuransi Tugu Pratama Indonesia.
If the government's and Pertamina's stakes are combined, they will become majority shares so they can fetch higher prices, he said. 
The government now holds a 17.50 percent stake in PT Tugu Pratama Indonesia and a 25.04 percent stake in PT Tugu Reasuransi Indonesia. 
In total, the government's and Pertamina's stakes in PT Tugu Pratama reach more than 70 percent of the company's shares, he said.
He said the recent general meeting of Pertamina's shareholders had given the green light to the company to release its non-core assets in PT Tugu Pratama.
The current economic growth is still not enough to significantly reduce the high unemployment rate and to lift the people out of poverty, a central bank official said.
At present we are still concerned about the high level of open unemployment which stands at 10.9 million or 10.3 percent, well above the pre-crisis level of 4.7 percent in 1997, Senior Deputy Bank Indonesia Governor Miranda Goeltom said in a seminar here on Wednesday.
The higher unemployment rate and limited job opportunities reflected a slow pace of the real sector's growth, she said.
This happens because the business world lacks new capacity to develop businesses to absorb rising labor force, she said.
The business world still had difficulties obtaining additional capital, either investment capital or working capital, from the banking sector, she said.
Ironically, the banking industry had a surplus of liquidity funds, she added.
In addition, she added, the key interest rate, locally known as BI Rate, had recorded a significant drop which was actually expected to encourage banks to lower their lending rates to spur the real sector's growth.
Miranda said the lower bank lending extended to the real sector showed the high degree of uncertainty about doing business in the country.
The lower bank lending could be seen from the banks' loan-to-deposit ratio LDR which had tended to fall since 1999, she said.
The LDR fell to 64.7 percent at the end of 2006 from the pre-crisis level of 100 percent.
The LDR slightly increased to 65.8 percent at the end of May 2007.
Undisbursed loans in the second quarter of 2007 rose Rp6.9 trillion, bringing their amount to Rp172 trillion or 20 percent of the total banking loans at the end of the quarter, she said. 
The significant increase in undisbursed loans happened to working capital credits reaching Rp4.3 trillion.
This implies that a great chunk of undisbursed loans in the second quarter of 2007 was still dominated by working capital credits, reaching 70.7 percent, she said.
If undisbursed loans did not occur, the economy would expand faster than expected and create more jobs, she said.
After all, she said, the central bank saw the economic indicators until July 2007 remained on the right track, raising the hope that the economic growth would hover above 6 percent this year.
It is a global phenomena and it happens in almost every emerging market, he said.
He said it would continue to happen so long as return on earning was still there.
Asked if Indonesia was ready in case of a reverse he said it was and there was nothing to worry about.
Our foreign exchange reserves are more than enough so that there is nothing to worry about, he said.

The plan to buy the two tankers was decided in a shareholder?s extraordinary meeting which was held on July 28 last year.
The Asian Development Bank ADB once applied to the Finance Ministry for a permit to issue local currency bonds in Indonesia, an official said.
They ADB once applied for a permit to issue local currency bonds but until now they have yet to issue the bonds, the ministry's director general of debt management, Rahmat Waluyanto, said on Friday. 
Waluyanto said the ministry had no problem with the bank's application.
On the contrary, the issuance of such bonds would benefit Indonesia.
We will much benefit from it, meaning that if the ADB which has high rating pushes through with the bond issuance investors will consider Indonesia a good place of investment, he said.
Asked if the finance minister had approved the bank's application, he reiterated that in principle, the minister had no problem with it.
The issuance of ADB bonds would have no impact on the bonds issued by the Indonesian government so far, he said.
The amount of ADB bonds is small so it will have no impact, he said.

The remaining $10 million would be paid in the second phase, Kurnardi said.

According to BNI managing director Sigit Pramono, at present BNI was engeneering a 60 percent market credit of the bank for non corporate and 40 percent for corporate in expanding the role of credit for SMEs and Syariah. 
However, we cannot leave behind the corporate credit, he said. 
For syariah funding, Sigit said that his side had a composition of about 80 percent for micro, small and medium businessmen and 20 percent for corporate.
The funding for April, 2007, according to him, reached Rp1.3 trillion and the target till the end of this year was set at Rp1.7 trillion. 
Rupiah on the Jakarta Inter-bank Spot Market on Monday morning strengthened approaching a level of Rp9,000 per US dollar to Rp9,013/9,020 against the US greenback compared to Rp9,015/9,051 to the US currency at last week's closing session.
Money market observer Edwin Sinaga said the market agents still speculated about buying rupiah rather than US dollar although the latter strengthened against Japanese yen on the regional market.
We are optimistic that rupiah will rebound to reach a level of Rp9,000 against the US dollar if the positive sentiment still continues, he said.
He said the Indonesian unit could actually increase higher because foreign agents predicted that the Janpanese central bank BOJ would raise its interest rate. 
BOJ was expected to increase its interest rate from 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent or 25 basis points, he noted.
He said the increase in the Japanese interest rate would give a positive sentiment to the Indonesian currency. 
Meanwhile, yen now drops to the US dollar as market agents are anticipating the planned interest rate, he said.
He said rupiah was expected to reach a level of Rp9,000 to the US dollar in the afternoon due the safe situation at home prompting local agents to buy the Indonesian unit. 
He said US dollar has strengthened to 123.28 against yen, and euro against the US dollar to 1.3535 from 1.3540.  
Publicly-listed integrated energy company PT Medco Energi Internasional has acquired Anadarko Tunisia Anagui Company's 40-percent participation right in the Anaguid Block in Tunisia worth US$10 million, a company executive said. 
The acquisition was conducted by the group's subsidiary, Medco Tunisia Anaguid Ltd. The agreement was made retroactive to June 12, 2007, Medco International Energi's corporate business development director Rashid I Mangunkusumo told the Jakarta Stock Exchange here Monday.
He said Anadarko which previously had a 55-percent stake in the Anaguid Block had sold the remaining 15 percent of its participation right to Pioneer Natural Resources which already had a 45-percent stake in the Anaguid Block.
However, implementation of the agreement on the transaction depends on the fulfilment of a precedent condition, namely approval from the Tunisian government to transfer Anaguid's participation right to Medco Tunisia and Pioneer, Rashid said.
Through the acquisitions, Medco Tunisia would hold a 40-percent and Pioneer a 60-percent stake in the Anaguid Block.
Pioneer Natural Resources was thus named operator of the block.
A surge in the price of red chili was the main cause of June's inflation of 0.23 percent, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said.
The price of red chili climbed to Rp18,000 in June from Rp14,000 a kg a month earlier, adding 0.10 percent to the month's inflation rate, BPS Deputy Chief for Economic Statistics Pietojo said here Monday.
June's inflation brought the calender year inflation rate to 2.08 percent and the year-on-year inflation rate to 5.77 percent, he said.
The prices of other food stuffs such as cooking oil and onion also rose, contributing 0.08 percent and 0.02 percent respectively to the inflation rate, he said.
The price of rice in June fell 0.10 percent from a month earlier but it was not enough to lower the consumer price index, he said.
Last month's core inflation stood at 0.10 percent, bringing the calender year core inflation rate to 2.11 percent and the year-on-year core inflation rate to 5.40 percent, he said.
All ASEAN member states had agreed to accelerate ASEAN's economic integration in accordance with the ASEAN leaders' commitment set forth in the blueprint for ASEAN Economic Community AEC, the Indonesian Finance Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
The AEC blueprint contains economic and financial aspects as well as measures that must be taken to bring about ASEAN's economic integration by 2015.

The meeting deemed it necessary to consider the different levels of member states' preparedness to face economic integration.
Therefore, the meeting agreed to give a kind of flexibility to any of the member states that still needed time to implement the AEC blueprint. 
In a narrower scope of discussion, the meeting felt the need to draw up a clear timeline for the liberalization of financial service subsectors in pursuit of ASEAN's economic integration. 
To make the discussion more intensive, the member states agreed to continue the discussion on the AEC blueprint at the 16th WC-FSL/AFAS meeting to be held in Bangkok on June 19-20 next year.
The AEC blueprint is expected to be agreed upon by ASEAN economic ministers at the ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting AEM in August 2007 in the Philippines and to be endorsed by the ASEAN heads of state/government at the ASEAN Summit on November 13-21 in Singapore.

This will be known only at the end of 2010, he said.

An Indonesian delegation arrived at Narita Airport, here on Wednesday for participating in a final-stage of negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement EPA with its Japanese counterpart.
The 30-member delegation was led by senior diplomat Soemadi DM Brotodiningrat and Halida Mijani, the Indonesian trade ministry's special staff for international cooperation.
We are determined to complete the negotiations on the pending clauses so that the agreement could be signed by the two Heads of State, Brotodiningrat, former Indonesian ambassador to Japan, told ANTARA. 
The pending clauses included those concerning technical cooperation.
Meanwhile, some clauses on investment, agriculture, trade and manpower supplies, have been dealt with and agreed upon.
The final stage of the negotiations was expected to last for days to settle remaining problems before the final draft agreement would be signed by Sumadi and Japan deputy foreign minister Mitoji Yabunaka.
Sumadi Brotodinngrat said that Japan, however, would need around two months to process the final-draft agreement in accordance with its internal procedures. 
The final draft of the agreement would later be formulated into an official agreement for signing by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Jakarta on August.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be accompanied by a number of Japanese businessmen and investors during his visit to Indonesia. 
Under the agreement Indonesia would be expected to be able to export its farm as well as manuffactured products to Japan as Japan would cut import tarrifs on the products by 90 percent or scrap them within 15 years.
In exchange, Indonesia would also cut or scrap import tarrifs on Japanese products in stages within 15 years to come.
Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu said early this month the issue that remained pending was about increasing cooperation capacity.
The minister said the EPA would give much benefit to the country, adding it would also put the country on an equal footing with other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN that had already signed similar agreements with Japan.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said Thursday the government remains upbeat about the economic growth forecast of 6.8 percent for 2008 while realizing it has to work hard to achieve the target.
The macro economy showed signs of improvement at the start of this year with the economic growth rising to 6.3 percent in the second quarter from 6 percent in the previous quarter, she said in the government's reply to the House factions' general views on the draft 2008 state budget and the financial notes.
Overall, the economy expanded 6.1 percent in the first half of 2007, she told a plenary session in the parliament building.
The growth was driven by the people's high purchasing power, relatively strong export growth and rising investment, she said.
In addition, there had been economic stability, evident from easing inflation which clocked in at 2.81 percent in the first seven months of 2007 against 3.33 percent a year earlier, she said.
Likewise, the rupiah's exchange rate which followed the floating system moved in a balanced range of fluctuations -- thing which was favorable to healthy economic activities, she said.
Although the rupiah's volatility has gone up it can be kept in a narrow range of fluctuations.
Interest on three-month Bank Indonesia certificates tends to decline to up to 7.83 percent in August 2007, she said.
She said the 2008 economic growth forecast of 6.8 percent would mainly be driven by much-anticipated strong consumption and export growth.
The consumption's role in spurring the economic growth should not necessarily be interpreted in a negative way.
Instead, the strong consumption indicated the revival of the people's purchasing power which would in the end boost the real sector's growth, she said.

The Economic Partnership Agreement EPA Indonesia and Japan are expected to conclude soon will provide opportunities for Indonesian agricultural and manufactured products and skilled manpower to enter Japan, an Indonesian official said.
The EPA will bring a lot of benefits to Indonesia, particularly in marketing agricultural and manufactured products in Japan, Halida Mujani, a senior advicer on international cooperation to indonesia's trade minister, said here on Wednesday.

The director general of taxation, Darmin Nasution, said here on Friday he would summon big crude palm oil producers for questioning on suspicion that many of them did not pay their tax properly causing a potential huge loss to the state.
There are around 600 CPO businessmen in the country but only 17 groups of CPO businessmen would be summoned to Jakarta with each group consisting of 22 to 23 businessmen.
He said his office had discovered that 90 percent of CPO businessmen had reported their income tax below its benchmark.
By paying below the benchmark it does not automatically mean that they have lied because it is possible that their plantations had been damaged or they have to repay their US dollar loans at a higher rate.

Privately-run Bank Bumiputra said on Wednesday its net profit in the first semester of 2007 climbed 316 percent to Rp17.91 billion from the same period last year.
The surge in net profit was driven by a 70.72 percent rise in net interest income to Rp184.282 billion on June 30, 2007 from Rp107.940 billion on June 30, 2006, the bank's president director, MC Palaniaptan said in a press conference here Wednesday.
Operational income rose 69.52 percent to Rp21.19 billion on June 30, 2007 from Rp12.50 billion on June 30, 2006, he said.
This was particularly caused by an increase in fee-based income to Rp13.77 billion from Rp9.53 billion, he said.

Domestic sales rose 8.6 percent to 4.8 million tons in the first semester this year from 4.4 million tons last year.
The company's business profit in the first semester this year however was down to Rp580 billion from Rp629 billion in the same period last year.
The decline happened because the company expanded to the market outside Java. 
We sell to outside Java because consumption there rose 14.2 percent and this has increased transportation and sale cost significantly, he said.
Business costs rose eight percent to Rp522 billion in the first semester this year from Rp482 billion recorded in the same period last year.
Although business profit dropped, the interest burden was down 36 percent to Rp104 billion from Rp163 last year.

Strong economic fundamentals would insulate Malaysia from the negative effects of rising oil prices in the world market, the central bank governor said Monday.
While inflation would likely expand slightly, the overall effect would be minimal, Bank Negara governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz was quoted by the official Bernama news agency as saying.
Our economy has been able to absorb the increase in oil price and we expect that with stronger fundamentals now, we are well positioned to aborb these higher oil prices, she said on the sidelines of an anti-poverty summit.
Malaysia has been able to maintain a low level of inflation despite oil prices rising to new heights, she stressed.

The GDP was estimated at Rp3,761.412 trillion, or lower than the government-proposed Rp3,804.154 trillion. 
The lower-than-estimated GDP was due to a change in the assumption of the rupiah's exchange rate to Rp9,050 from Rp9,100 previously, he said.
The economy was expected to perform better throughout this year thanks to internal and external factors, he said.
He said the economic growth rate target of 6.3 percent for 2007 was expected to be driven by robust investment, non-oil/non-gas exports, public consumption and relatively strong global economic performance.

With the key rate remaining at 8.25 percent, the room for the banking sector to cut lending rates in support of the real sector's growth would remain available, he said.
The central bank noted that banking loans grew by 4.4 percent to Rp38.5 trillion in July from a month earlier, he said.
Debt rating agency Moody's Investors Service said Tuesday it has put the ratings of 11 publicly-listed Indonesian banks' long-term foreign currency debts and deposits under review for possible upgrades.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has asked national banks to boost economic growth with their equity by providing credits to productive sectors and micro, small and medium businesses UMKM. 
All financial and capital resources like bank credits should take advantage of the construction of power plants, trasportation and infrastructure. 
Without these three elements, the economy will not run well, and reduce competitiveness and investment, he said here on Wednesday. 
In addition, the national banks should also support the development of investment, boosting exports, industries, agriculture and services as well as the real sector for a substantial contribution to economic growth. 
I am calling on you at Bank of Indonesia and leaders of other banks to make available your credits to finance economic growth. 
For increasing their equity, national banks should support the development of micro, small and medium businesses, he said.
Economic development using one's own equity, the president added, should be made as an ideology in the economic development of the country for the sake of the people. 
Economic development with equity should be made an ideology, a choice, and paradigm which will enable us to make progress with the participation of the people, he said, adding that there was no use to pursue a 6-7 percent growth if it is only designed to strengtheng the conomic fundamentals, he said. 
In addition, decisions on channeling indirect credits should not be made in legal and criminal cases such as in non performing loans.
Lippo Group has set aside US$650 million for a broadband multimedia business to be developed by its subsidiary, First Media, in the next four years, a spokesman said.

which was 31.6 times the Rp.23.9 billion profit it recorded in a corresponding period in 2006.

The new location sits on 13 million tons of good quality coal deposits.
PTBA has been relocating a number of its mining facilities such as vehicle pool, mechanical assistance facility, K-3 office and a number of other facilities.
The relocation of these facilities was in the framework of the company's long term plan, he said.
Eko said construction of the new factory was expected to start at the beginning of 2008. 
The company would familiarize all it shareholders with he plan in September 2007.
PTBA Tanjung Enim was established in 1997 with a production capacity of 10,000 tons per annum. 
In 2006, the company's coal briquette production reached 6,300 tons of which 30 percent was supplied to consumers in South Sumatra and 70 percent to Jakarta and its buffer cities of Bogor, Bekasi and Tangerang.
The realization of the company's production was small because briquettes were not competitive compared to subsidized kerosene, Eko said.
Publicly-listed PT Indonesia Air Transport IATA has won a US$49.9 million contract with ConocoPhilips Indonesia for the leasing of 3 EC155B1 helicopters, an IATA executive said.
On September 10, 2007 we received a letter of intent from ConocoPhilips dated September 7 to lease three of our helicopters, IATA finance director Krisman Tarigan said here Wednesday.
The letter of intent said ConocoPhilips would lease the choppers for five years, namely from February 1, 2008 to January 2013.
Publicly-listed PT Bank Victoria International has officially acquired 99.80 percent or 8.233 million of Bank Swaguna's 8.25 million shares with the signing of a relevant agreement by the two parties last September 7, a spokesman said.
Bank Victoria was also planning to increase Bank Swaguna's capital from Rp2.5 billion per December 2006 to Rp80 billion by late this year, Bank Victoria Director Daroel O. Aboebakar said in a report to the Jakarta Stock Exchange JSX here Thursday.
The injection of more capital into Bank Swaguna would be done to meet the capital adequacy ratio requirement for commercial banks under the Indonesian Banking Architecture scheme, Daroel said.
Bank Swaguna which Bank Victoria bought from its main shareholders, the Moeis family, would eventually be developed into its sharia division, he said.
However, the conversion into sharia bank would not be done in the immediate future but in stages until next year.
Bank Swaguna will continue to be operated as a conventional bank until it is turned into a sharia bank in 2008, he said.
PT Ramayana Lestari Sentosa RALS, one of the country's largest retail chains, failed to acquire 55 percent of PT Alfa Retailindo ALFA's shares as the companies were unable to agree on some of the terms. 
Our plan to purchase 55 percent of ALFA's shares failed to materialize as we could not agree on a number of clauses in the draft sales and purchase agreement, RALS Director Suryanto said in a report to the Jakarta Stock Exchange here on Monday.
Both sides signed a note on September 21 canceling the planned sales and purchase agreement, he said.
State bank BRI is ready to become an anchor bank as it is sound and is performing well, its director, Sofyan Bashir, said here Tuesday.

Publicly-listed cement maker PT Semen Gresik Tbk is planning to issue US$400 million bonds next year to meet nearly 50 percent of its need for funds from external sources.
We project proceeds from the issuance of bonds to account for 50 percent of Semen Gresik's external funding sources, the company's finance director, Cholil Hasan, said here Monday.
The company's total need for funds in five years' time was estimated at US$1.3 billion with US$500 million of it expected to originate from internal sources, he said. 
The dollar-denominated bonds would be issued next year due to the uncertain conditions of the bond market this year, he said.
We still depend on market conditions. 
The present bond market is not yet stable, he said.
Besides the dollar-denominated bonds, PT Semen Gresik would also issue local currency bonds next year with the amount still to be adjusted to the company's plan to make bank loans, he said. 
It is possible for us to issue both of the bonds next year. 
The issuance of bonds is expected to increase leverage and reduce cost capital
PT Astra Internasional Tbk, one of Indonesia's largest business conglomerates, has decided to pay an interim dividend of Rp160 per share for the book year ending December 31, 2007.

Coordinating Minister for Economy Boediono has admitted that the national economy in the past three years had yet to see promising and significant development, although the government had worked hard to implement a number of policies.
We have worked hard to reach our national economic goals but we still have a long way to go. We have done what we had to do in the context of global and national economy but the results have yet to be promising, Boediono said after attending a ceremony to welcome visiting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at Merdeka Palace here on Monday.
He made the statement in response to a question on national economic development in comparison with other development sectors during the past three years of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's government.
The government's economic team came under public criticism because its performance had yet to reduce the poverty and unemployment rates.
Commenting on the high unemployment rate, Boediono said the government would make every effort to increase investment and to absorb as much manpower as possible.
But he admitted that increasing investment in the country remained difficult because of the complicated licensing procedures.
However, the minister expressed optimism that economic growth this year would reach 6.3 percent and 6.8 percent in 2009.
I am optimistic that economic growth will reach 6.3 percent this year and edge up to 6.5 to 6.8 percent in 2009, Boediono said.
Concerning the world oil pricce which had hit US$90 per barrel, the coordinating minister said he was still observing the trend in the world oil price whether it would continue to rise until after the end of the year.
Let's wait and see if the world oil price will continue to fluctuate. But if it remains high, I am afraid it will have a negative impact on our national economy, he said.
Domestic car sales in September fell to 41,035 units from 41,471 units a month earlier, data show.
PT Arona Bina Sejati Tbk, a wood processing company, dismissed all its employees on Oct 10, 2007 in connection with the company's restructurization, its president director said.
The mass lay-off was part of the company's restructurization and the settlement of its debts to wood suppliers, the company's president director, Chang Yen Pao, told the Jakarta Stock Exchange BEJ here on Monday.
He said PT Arona Bina Sejati had received some Rp8 billion from PT Benjamin to settle all of its debts.
PT Benjamin has expressed its wish to buy PT Arona's assets, Chang said.
The Indonesian economy in the third quarter of 2007 grew by 3.9 percent, bringing the calendar year growth to 6.3 percent and the year-on-year growth to 6.5 percent, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said.
The GDP growth, exclusive of oil and gas, in the year to Sept 30 was 6.8 percent, or higher than the overall GDP growth which reached 6.3 percent. 
This is something normal as the growth of oil lifting and so forth usually goes downward, he said. 
The GDP in the first nine months of 2007 totalled Rp2,901.3 trillion, raising the hope that the GDP would reach Rp4,000 trillion by the end of 2007, he said.
He said household consumption contributed 5.3 percent to the year-on-year growth, government consumption 6.5 percent, gross fixed capital formation 8.8 percent and exports 7.8 percent.
In terms of regional economic growth, Java contributed the most to the third quarter GDP with 59.3 percent, followed by Sumatra 23.2 percent, Kalimantan 9 percent, Sulawesi 4 percent and other regions 4.5 percent, he said. 
He said the government hoped inflation in the fourth quarter of 2007 would be the same as the current calendar inflation figure of 6.3 percent.
If we look at the impact of global oil price hikes, we must keep sectors that are not directly affected by the global oil price hikes. 
The sectors are construction, trade, telecommunication, financial and services and agricultural sectors, he said.
Economic Coordinating Ministry senior adviser M Ikhsan predicted that Indonesia would no longer be a net oil importer in 2008 because of increased oil production capacity and economization of domestic fuel oil. 
Possibly 2008 will be the last year for Indonesia to be a net oil importer. 
Whatever will happen in 2008, there will be an increase in our oil and gas production, he said at a seminar on national growth amid global world oil price fluctuations in Jakarta on Thursday. 
So far Indonesia was in the category of net oil importers whereas the total value of its oil imports was higher the value of its oil exports. 
According to him, a change could happen in Indonesia's status as oil production in the Cepu Block would reach at least 30 of capacity in 2009 and 100 percent in 2010. 
In addition, according to him fuel oil consumption would sharply decline in 2009 on account of the operation of gas-fired and thermal power plants. 
He also said the kerosene-to-gas conversion program would become effective in 2009 and be completed in 2010 
while supply of gas would also increase as Tangguh gas fields would start producing with partial capacity in 2008 and with full capacity in 2009. 
A World Bank statement that Indonesia's poverty rate will have dropped 2.6 percent by 2008 is not more than an effort to justify the government's poverty programs, a private economic analyst said. 
Henri Saparini, an analyst at the Advisory Group on Economics, Industry and Trade Econit, was referring to a World Bank projection that Indonesia's poverty rate in 2008 would be 42.6 percent 100.7 million people or down from 45.2 perent 105.3 million people in 2007. 
The projection appeared to be just an attempt to justify the government's poverty alleviation progrms most of which were funded by the World Bank, Henri said here Friday. 
He said the poverty rate projection in the latest World Bank review was made using its new calculation method. 
As we know the World Bank has introduced a new method to calculate poverty rates, namely one in which economic growth, poverty programs and poverty budgets are taken into account, he said.
Henri said if the World Bank wanted to use these components in calculating the poverty rate, it should also pay heed to the sources of economic growth, the direction of poverty programs and the period in which the poverty budget was realized, If the sources of growth are not labor-intensive or the poverty programs are not directly aimed at the poor or the poverty budget is realized at the end of the year, the poverty rate will still increase, he said.
Previously, the World Bank had projected that Indonesia's economy would grow 6.4 percent in 2008, or more rapidly than its projection of 6.3 percent in 2007, This, according to the World Bank, would reduce Indonesia's poverty rate.
Stock rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia Pefindo has upgraded its rating for PT Bank NISP Tbk to idAA- from idA+ previously, and its subordinated bond I/2003 to idA+ from idA .
The outlook of the ratings is stable, Pefindo analysts Hendro Utomo dan Yans Simbolon said here on Thursday.
The analysts in their statement said that the upgrading of the bank's ratings reflected a strong business position of NISP and the asset quality which was under control, including sound capitalization.
However, the ratings were still mitigated by a moderate profitability.
NISP Bank is one of the oldest bank in Indonesia. 
Since 2004, OCBC Bank of Singapore through OCBC Overseas Investment Pte. Ltd., OCBC's full subsidiary, has been the majority shareholder of NISP Bank, controlling 72.4 percent of the bank's shares as per June 30, 3007.
Other share holders of NISP included International Finance Corporation 7.17 percent and the public 20.43 percent.
Indonesian stock rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia Pefindo has upgraded its ratings for PT Bank Negara Indonesia Persero TBk or BNI and the state-owned bank's bonds I/2003 due on July 10, 2011, to idA+ from idA previously.
The rating also showed the bank's strong capital basis, strong liquidity after the right issues, as well as BNI's strong business position, the statement said.
However, the national rating agency said that the bank's rating was still mitigated by the weak quality of its assets.
Up to date, BNI has a large coverage of banking commercial activity through its 972 offices and 2,325 ATMs throughout Indonesia. 
The bank has around 18,649 employees to support its daily business activities.
As per August 2007 after the right issue, the Indonesian Government owned 73.26 percent of BNI's shares, and the remaining 26.74 percent were owned by other share holders including the public.
Publicly-listed Bank Mega Tbk will issue a 10-year subordinated bond of Rp1 trillion to strengthen its capital and get long-term financing sources.
In its prospectus published on Thursday, Bank Mega said the bond which offeres purchase option after the fifth year of issue will carry fixed interest with interest rate in the first five years to be lower than that in the ensuing years.
However, the fixed interest has yet to be set.
The bank expected the bond to be traded at the Surabaya Stock Exchange starting on December 12, 2007. 
Acting as bond issue underwriters will be PT Mega Capital Indonesia, PT Standard Chartered Securities Indonesia, and PT AAA Securities with Bank BRI as a trustee agent.
Fitch Ratings on Wednesday assigned a national long-term rating of 'A+idn', an individual rating of 'D', and a support rating of '4' to publicly-listed Bank Mega Tbk.
The outlook was stable, Fitch said in a press statement.
At the same time, Fitch assigned an expected rating of 'Aidn' to the bank's proposed 10-year subordinated bond I/2007, amounting to a maximum of IDR1.5 trillion. The final rating is contingent upon receipt of final documents conform to information already received.
Along with a bigger increase in non-interest income, although about half was a one-off trading profit, Bank Mega booked a higher pre-tax return on investment ROA of 2.5% in the first semester of 2007 compared to 0.8% in 2006 and 1.2% in 2005.
Fitch expects Bank Mega to sustain its modest profitability in the next one to two years with support from benign economic conditions, while noting constraints on profitability from its improving but still less favourable funding composition as compared to those of its peers.
The bank's total CAR of 12.8% Tier 1: 11.7% at the end of the first semester of 2007 was much lower than the industry average of about 20%.
Rupiah on the Jakarta Inter Bank Spot Market tended to be stable against US dollar on Friday morning as market agents prudently bought and sold the two units. 
The rate of rupiah was recorded at Rp9,142/9,145 per US dollar compared to Rp9,143/9,147 to the greenback the day before.
Money market observer Edwin Sinaga said rupiah stood at a narrow range as seen from the price of the two currencies, namely, Rp9,150/9,147 to US dollar. 
Such a condition showed that rupiah was still on the normal position although there were worries about unstable global economy, he said.    
He pointed out that the rate of the Indonesian currency was held by the strengthening price of world crude oil which exceeded US$90 per barrel but it was offset by the ameliorating regional stock market.   
Rupiah tended to strengthen also due to the weakening rate of US dollar against yen and euro, he said.  
He said the expected global economic fluctuation which was predicted to create economic lethargy might not occur as a number of top-shelf banks have announced that they have performed better.  
Thus, the global economic fluctuation would not happen in Asia, particularly Indonesia, he said. 
adding that the government was even optimistic to reach the target of the 2008 economic growth by 6.8 percent although the world crude oil price tended to strengthen.  
The government has made new policies to overcome possible economic fluctuation by taking efficient measures including setting the amount of state budget subsidies, he said.   
Meanwhile, US dollar dropped against Japanese yen to 114.08 compared to the previous rate of 114.20 while the US greenback was on a stable position to euro at 1,4325. 
US dollar dropped to yen as data showed an indication of weakening US economy and the Fed might lower its interest rate.   
Rupiah was expected to strengthen in the afternoon after three days price corrections, Edwin said.   
The Indonesian central bank predicts the country's economic growth will reach 6.3 percent in the third quarter of 2007, driven by increasing consumption and exports.
While in the fourth quarter it is expected to reach 6.4 percent because credit distribution will be more expansive, the bank's director of economic research and monetary policy, Made Sukada, said here on Tuesday.
The central bureau of statistics will officially announce record of the country's economic growth in the third quarter on November 15.
Sukada said the country's balance of payments in the third quarter showed a surplus although it was not as big as in the second quarter.
The country's foreign exchange reserves reached US$54.2 billion by the end of October or were enough for paying imports and foreign debts for five months , he said.
He said his office would closely monitor the effect of the hike in the year-on-year inflation in October from 6.03 percent to 6.13 percent that occurred in spite of the fact that inflation in the month reached 6.98 percent or higher than September's inflation of 6.95 percent.
The inflation rate was driven by increasing prices as a result of a hike in the prices of world commodities besides high public expectation of future inflation. 
Pressures from volatile foods and administered price are lower than the month before, he said.
Made said the central bank's target would remain unchanged from its early prediction , namely six plus and minus one percent and five plus and minus one percent in 2008.
Among the risks to be monitored is the world oil price hike that continues increasing the prices of goods including crude palmoil, rubber and other agricultural export commodities, he said.
The central bank would also closely monitor the impact of the subprime mortgage crisis that has not yet settled down, he said.
In 2008 Made predicts the country's economy will grow more than 6.5 percent because imports from emerging markets like China would remain high.
Although imports from advanced countries will probably drop as a result of slowing world economy caused by oil price hike they will be compensated for by imports from the emerging markets, he said.
He said the central bank predicts the world oil price would decline because of a slowing world economy and probably increasing production from OPEC.
Bank Indonesia BI Tuesday kept its key rate at 8.25 percent for the fourth month in a row after it had conducted comprehensive evaluation of the present economic developments and identified the existing risk factors.
BI also observed the upward trend in global crude prices and the further impact of subprime mortgage crisis in the US, Made Sukada, the director of the central bank's economic research and monetary policy, said.
He said the key rate, locally known as BI Rate, still had a room to go down by 25 basis points to 8 percent until the end of this year.
The BI Rate still has a wide room to fall due to the difference between our interest and other countries', he said.
The decision to keep the key rate unchanged would not have an adverse impact on the country's economic growth, he said. 
The BI Rate at the current level is still able to stimulate the country's economic growth in the future as banks still have room to lower their lending rates, he said.
Indonesia in cooperation with Japan has organized the same workshop twice, namely Workshop on Deposit Insurance System and Valuation in January 2004 and Workshop on Deposit Insurance System in July 2004.
About 60 delegates from various member countries of ASEM will attend the workshop here on Wednesday and Thursday.

Speakers will among others come from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Commission, Japan and Thailand.
Cellular telephone operator Telkomsel said it would obey Monday's order by the Business Competition Supervisory Commission KPPU to lower its average tariffs of mobile communication services by up to 15 percent.
In line with our policy of obeying regulations in operating the company, PT Telkomsel will respect whatever decision is made in a legal process in Indonesia, including the decision of KPPU, PT Telkomsel Prsident Director Kiskenda Suriahardja said here on Tuesday.
He said Telkomsel whose majority stake 65 percent was owned by the government through state telecommunication company PT Telkom would always run its business based on regulations in force.
Basically, Telkomsel will always abide by existing regulations and law-based decisions but for the sake of clarity Telkomsel will appeal the KPPU decision, he said.
He said Telkomsel would appeal the KPPU decision because it felt that so far it had always abided by the regulations and had never quoted excessive prices.
Domestic motorcycle sales in the first ten months of 2007 stood at 3,807,985 units compared to 4,427,342 units throughout last year.
Honda motorcycle maker took a commanding lead, selling 1,707,339 units in the first ten months ended on Oct. 31, according to data from the Indonesian Motorcycle Manufacturers Association AISI made available on Tuesday.

Credit rating agency Pefindo has affirmed its idA- ratings for state-owned Bank Ekspor Indonesia and the bank's outstanding bond I/2003, bond II/2005, and bond III/2006.
The ratings reflect the bank's strong position in export credit segment, strong assets quality, and favorable liquidity profile, the agency said in a statement on Monday.
However, marginal growths of export financing during the past several years despite the promising potential, have constrained the above ratings.
Outlook for the ratings have been revised to `Positive' from `Stable' considering the possibility of the bank's transformation to become Indonesia's Export Credit Agency ECA in the near future.
Bank Ekspor Indonesia is a state-owned institution established to facilitate the country's export transactions. The establishment of the bank was based on the government's decree, while the operating license was issued by Bank Indonesia the central bank in 1999.
Its main business activities are providing financing, guarantees, consultation and other supporting services for export-oriented activities. 
Until now, the bank's business mostly comprises of lending activities divided into direct financing to exporters, as well as refinancing other banks' export credits.
Credit rating agency Pefindo has upgraded its corporate ratings for state electricity firm PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara PLN and its bond VIII/2006 of Rp2.2 trillion and Ijarah bond I/2006 of Rp200 billion to idA+ and idA+sy from idA and idAsy .
The ratings upgrade reflects strong and proven support from the Indonesian government, the company's superior market position and relatively strong liquidity, Pefindo said in a statement issued on Monday.
However, the ratings are still constrained by inflexible tariff adjustments, high exposure to foreign exchange currency risks and high production cost in the medium term, the agency said.
PLN which is wholly owned by the state is engaged in power generation, transmission and distribution throughout the country.
Following the cancellation of law No. 20/2002, PLN retained its monopoly on electricity supply in Indonesia.
Indonesia's inflation rate was recorded at 0.18 percent in November 2007, fueled by an increase in the prices of clothing. 
The inflation figure brought on-year inflation to 6.71 percent and calendar year inflation to 5.43 percent, Central Bureau of Statistics BPS Chief Rusman Heriawan said here Monday. 
The prices of clothing rose as many people bought clothes after instead of before the Lebaran post-fasting month festivities, he said.
The prices of almost all goods which were in great demand during the Lebaran festivities dropped in November, he said.
The price of the cheapest rice only increased 0.09 percent and that of standard rice rose 0.16 percent. 
The price of chicken meat dropped 13.56 percent, that of beef declined 17.23 percent and that of kerosene fell 7.45 percent, he said.
However, the price of cooking oil slightly increased 0.73 percent and that of wheat powder rose 4.03 percent, he said.
Publicly-listed tin mining company PT Timah Tbk has set itself the target of producing 60,000 tons of tin next year compared to the 2007 production forecast of 57,000 to 59,000 tons.
The 2007 production represents a significant increase if compared to our production target of 50,000 tons for that year. 
This is due to high demand for the commodity on the global market, the company's finance director, Krisnha Syarief said here Tuesday.
PT Timah expected its profit in 2008 to increase by 20 percent from its target of Rp1.5 trillion for this year, he said.
Income in 2007 was estimated at Rp7.5 trillion, he said.
The Japanese government has agreed to extend a Yen 23.18 billion loan to Indonesia to fund a program to tackle natural disasters causing both economic and social losses.
A memorandum of understanding on the loan was signed here on Tuesday by Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Shin Ebihara and the secretary of the Directorate General for Asia Pacific and Africa of the Foreign Ministry, Kenssy Dwi Ekaningsih.
A statement from the embassy said the loan was intended to support restoration and rehabilitation work in the aftermath of the disasters that occurred in Indonesia in 2007 and also as an effort to improve the Indonesian government's disaster managemnt policy and system.
A total of 129 disasters occurred in Indonesia in the past 10 years, causing the state a loss of some US$9.64 billion and a death toll of 320,000 people.
The United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF has extended a US$131.5 million grant to Indonesia to improve the welfare of children and help to fulfil their rights in 2008.
A press statement from the UNICEF said on Monday the grant was meant to support the government efforts to improve the situation in mother-and-child health services, nutrition, access to clean water and environmental sanitation.
The grant which was US$11.5 million higher than the amount UNICEF had given for 2007 was to cover programs which will be started in 2008 would be implemented in 104 districts in 17 provinces.
A memorandum of understanding on the grant was scheduled to be signed on Monday. 
PT International Nickel Indonesia INCO and the energy and mineral resources ministry are currently discusssing a plan to review the rate of the company's royalties to the government, the company's chief said. 
We and the mineral resources ministry are discussing the rate of our royalties but we have not yet decided how much we have to pay to the government, PT INCO President Director Arif S Siregar said here on Monday.
He said under its first work contract PT INCO was required to pay royalties on a floating basis, namely based on the nickel price prevailing in the world market.
Based on the signed 2008-2025 work contract, however, PT INCO was required to pay royalties at a flat rate based on the assumed nickel price of US$7 - US$8 per pound.
Indonesia's economic growth rate in 2008 is expected to reach six percent only, instead of 6.8 percent as officially projected, an economic researcher said here on Monday.
Indonesia's economic growth rate next year is estimated to settle at between six and 6.5 percent only. 
The higher figure can be reached only if the economic performance level in 2007 can be maintained next year, Latif Adam, an economic researcher at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences LIPI said.
The International Monetary Fund IMF has predicted that the world's economic growth would slow down from 5.2 percent to 4.8 percent in 2008.
Only Africa will experience an increase in economic growth from 5.7 percent to 6.7 percent in 2008, he said.
The LIPI researcher said the United State would see an economic growth stagnation at 1.9 percent while the growth of the European Union's economy would drop from 2.5 percent to 2.1 percent and Japan's from two percent to 1.7 percent.
He said about 45 percent of Indonesia's direct exports would be shipped to the three destinations. 
There were also indications that Indonesia's exports to Singapore, Hong Kong and China would be reexported to the United States, Europe and Japan.
Economic sluggishness in the three destinations of Indonesia's exports will automatically disturb Indonesia's economic performance. 
And the world's hope for economic drive is likely to turn to China, India and Russia, Adam said.
But the problem was that the IMF prediction indicated that China's and India's economies would also slow down. 
In the 2007- 2008 period, China's economic growth was expected to drop from 11.5 percent to 10 percent and India's from 8.9 percent to 8.4 percent, he said.
Rupiah on the Jakarta Inter-Bank Spot Market on Monday morning dropped to Rp9,370/9,375 against US dollar compared to Rp9,335/9,375 to the greenback on the closing session last weekend.
The Indonesian unit plunged by 35 points as market agents actively bought US dollar before the end of the year, private bank PT Bank Saudara's foreign exchange analyst, Rully Nova, said here Monday. 
Rully said it would be hard for rupiah to near the level of Rp9,400 per US dollar as Bank Indonesia the central bank would again enter the market. 
The central bank would likely release its dollar to make rupiah away from the psychological limit of Rp9,400 against the US currency, he said.
Motorcycle distributor PT Wahanaartha Harsaka plans to sell 590 million shares or 29.5 percent of its fully paid-up capital through an initial public offering IPO in January 2008.
The shares will be offered from January 23 to 25 and listed at the Indonesian Stock Exchange BEI on January 31, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.  
Wahanaartha posted a net profit of Rp11.50 billion in the first nine months of 2007, up from Rp7.84 billion throughout last year.
Economic Coordinating Ministry senior adviser M Ikhsan predicted that Indonesia would no longer be a net oil importer in 2008 because of increased oil production capacity and economization of domestic fuel oil.
Possibly 2008 will be the last year for Indonesia to be a net oil importer.
 Whatever will happen in 2008, there will be an increase in our oil and gas production, he said at a seminar on national growth amid global world oil price fluctuations in Jakarta on Thursday. 
He also said the kerosene-to-gas conversion program would become effective in 2009 and be completed in 2010.
Henri said if the World Bank wanted to use these components in calculating the poverty rate, it should also pay heed to the sources of economic growth, the direction of poverty programs and the period in which the poverty budget was realized.
If the sources of growth are not labor-intensive or the poverty programs are not directly aimed at the poor or the poverty budget is realized at the end of the year, the poverty rate will still increase, he said.
Previously, the World Bank had projected that Indonesia's economy would grow 6.4 percent in 2008, or more rapidly than its projection of 6.3 percent in 2007, This, according to the World Bank, would reduce Indonesia's poverty rate.

Few buyers who speculate to buy US dollars before The Fed the US central bank lowers its interest rate next year continue to buy the US currency, Foreign Exchange Analyst of private bank PT Bank Saudara, Rully Nova, said here Thursday.
The drop in the rupiah rate is only temporary in nature due to a sudden need of US dollar before New Year's Eve, and rupiah is expected to strengthen next week, he said.
He said rupiah would likely strengthen due to the weakening US dollar against Japanese yen, one US dollar is now recorded at 114 yens and the US unit is expected to weaken further to below the level of 100 yens. 
Such a condition would likely make The Fed lower its interest rate next month, the US dollar weakens due to the housing case in the US and the credit tightening measure which have inflicted losses on US financial institutions, he said. 
The rupiah rate will likely approach the level of Rp9,300 to US dollar if The Fed drops its interest rate by 50 basis points, he said. 
The Fed lowered its interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent last month but rupiah only stood at a range between Rp9,370/9,390 to the US currency, he said.  
Rully said he was optimistic that the government would continue to maintain the rupiah rate in order that the currency would not go down further to a worse position till the 2009 general elections. 
He said the government should also heed the weakening economic growth in Europe and the United States as it would affect Indonesia's foreign exchange earnings although the domestic market remained conducive.

The Indonesian unit dropped by 65 points to Rp9,345/9,350 against US dollar compared to Rp9,280/9,300 to the greenback at the closing session last week. 
Retail Banking Director of PT Bank Mega Tbk publicly listed, Kostaman Thayib, said here the domestic money market was still under pressure due to the fluctuating global money market.   
The fluctuation triggered market agents to buy US dollar as they were more confident in dollar to rupiah, he said.
According to Kostaman, the market is actually still waiting for follow-up effects of the US subprime mortgage which has pressured the Wall Street due to the crisis in the US housing credits.  
A number of analysts are still difficult to predict whether or not the market fluctuation would continue after several central banks spent funds in anticipation of such a condition, he said.    
Rupiah would likely continue to slump to Rp9,400 per US dollar but Bank Indonesia the central bank might enter the market to anticipate strong pressures against rupiah. 
We are optimistic that the central bank will keep monitoring the movement as US dollar is weakening against Japanese yen on the global market, he said.  
Actually, rupiah still has the opportunity to strengthen but worries about the fluctuation of the global money market still remain, he said, adding that rupiah was expected to be bullish in the afternoon.

At the secondary offering, the state bank stocks dipped from Rp2,125 per share to Rp2,050 or a fall by 3.5 percent at the opening session of the stocks trading.
It even happened to plunged to the Rp1,975 level, but rebounded again where it stayed at the Rp2,000 level.
The fall of the BNI share prices was due to the fact that it floated its shares in the wrong time, when the market was undergoing turmoil circumstances.
In the meantime, underwriters of the BNI share issuance, namely PT Bahana Securities and PT Danareksa Securitas could not do much to halt the sliding of the bank's share prices.
A number of foreign underwriters such as Marryl Linch and Kim Eng Securities, as well as Danareksa, also joined the market to release their stocks, while they, as underwriters, should have played their mediation role in protecting the fall of BNI share price.
Minister for State Enterprises Sofyan Djalil said he could understand if BNI stock price fell. 
It is understandable as the market now is undergoing turmoil.
But the fundamentals of BNI remain strong and it still promises profit in the long run for investors to purchase BNI's stocks.
We are convinced its share price would regain a strong level, the minister said.
BNI President Director Sigit Pramono acknowledged BNI floated its shares at an unfavorable time.
But its share price would increase again when the market turmoil returned to normal.
Our fundamentals are good so that there is nothing to worry about, he added.

The rating reflected the bank's strong market position, sound capitalization and good diversified businesses, the agency said in a statement. 
However, the ever increasingly fiercer competition in the banking industry, particularly in the medium commercial business had reduced the supporting factors, it said.

The prices of other commodities will certainly slow down inflation but I don't know which commodities.
I think it is not proper to talk about the matter, he said.

September's inflation figure brought the calendar inflation rate to 4.41 percent and the year-on-year inflation figure to 6.95 percent, BPS Chief Rusman Heriawan said here on Monday.
We have so far concentrated on basic necessaries but it turns out that the biggest contribution to inflation was from the education sector, he said.
The rise in tuition fees contributed 0.10 percent to the total inflation figure, followed by an increases in the prices of fresh fish 0.10 percent, purebred chicken meat 0.07 percent and gold jewelry 0.04 percent, he said.
The toll tariff hike contributed 0.02 percent to the inflation rate although the toll tariff rose 22.8 percent, he said.
Despite the rise in September's inflation figure, the BPS chief said he believed the full-year inflation target of 6.0 percent for this year could be achieved, depending on volatile food prices in the two weeks ahead of the post-fasting month Lebaran festivities.
What we need to be watchful about is the prices in the first two weeks of October.
If the prices are kept in check, inflation can be controled.
Normally, the prices of goods recede again after Lebaran, he said.
With the cumulative inflation figure at 4.41 percent in September, the government still had up to 0.5 percent in each of the three remaining months to achieve the full-year inflation target of 6.0 percent, he said. 
In December, there will be another inflationary pressure, namely from Christmast festivities, he said.
The World Bank has expressed support to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's decision to terminate the Consultative Group on Indonesia CGI
We welcome President Yudhoyono's announcement yesterday Wednesday that Indonesia would no longer rely on the CGI framework, World Bank Country Director for Indonesia Andrew Steer said in a press release issued on Friday.
Indonesia had skillfully built a strong economy and was no longer dependent on donor funding, Steer said.
According to him, the old CGI model in which the government presented a financing gap and donors pledged funds to fill it was no longer relevant to a strong country like Indonesia.
For the past two years, the CGI had been fully chaired and led by the Indonesian government and had moved away from a focus on financing gaps and pledging, he said.
We believe it is now appropriate that Indonesia should graduate from the CGI process, he said.
He added, however, that it was valuable for Indonesia to maintain a dialog with the international community on issues relating to access to technology, ideas, capital and trade.
The CGI which is a consortium of creditor and donor countries and institutions for Indonesia was set up in 1992 to replace the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia IGGI.
It is made up of around 30 bilateral and multilateral creditors, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and governments of industrialized countries like Japan, the United States and Britain.

Kotaro Tamura, parliamentary secretary for financial services at the Cabinet Office, told a Japan-Europe symposium in Tokyo, In order to sustain the size and dynamism of the economy, we have to increase productivity per person .
We are good at manufacturing, but we have some problems with the productivity in the service sector, especially financial sector, he said.
We need to increase our productivity in the financial sector.
Otherwise, our economy will shrink .
Tamura, who attended the event in place of Financial Services Minister Yuji Yamamoto, said Japan's position as a major financial center has been threatened by its Asian rivals in close time zones, such as bourses in Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Mumbai.
They are catching up with us at a very fast speed, he said.
The parliamentary secretary also said that creating more efficient capital and bond markets in Japan will help improve the fiscal health of the state, which is saddled with debts equivalent to about 160 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
The government has made massive investments in those markets.
As for concrete financial reform measures, Tamura said the government will urge the Tokyo Stock Exchange to expand the scope of transaction items, extend its trading hours and step up cooperation with overseas bourses.

McCreevy said the European Union has implemented financial services integration measures since 1999 and that they bore fruit as shown by the creation of pan-European banks and the lowered financing costs following the convergence of interest rates in many markets.
The commissioner said that as a next step the European authorities must monitor closely newer products and financial trends, such as hedge funds and private equity .

The banks are ready to disburse Rp65.39 percent of their total funds amounting to Rp418.75 trillion in state debentures SUN to the real sector provided that the government and Bank Indonesia BI are ready to facilitate the real sector's development, a banker said here on Monday.
The banks are ready to divert their SUN funds into credits owing to the fact that banks are surplus with liquidity, But it should be balanced with preparations by the government and the central bank BI, Retail Banking Director of Bank Mega, Kostaman Thayib
The minister of finance said earlier that the real sector was expected to grow and banks were, thus, expected to support it through their intermendiary roles, In this case, banks should release their SUN funds and channel them in the form of credits.
Kostaman said 65.39 percent of the banks' total SUN funds of Rp418.75 trillion were a large amount to be diverted into credits.
He said that the flow of funds to the real sector had been limited so that provision of credits to the production sector needed to be boosted.
Kostaman said that banks nowadays was surplus in liquidity so that they investment their funds in the BI certificates.
This caused the loan to deposit ratio of banks to reach 50 percent.
Basically we are ready to channel the SUN funds provided that the government also adopts various policies which could boost the economic growth, he added.
He said that credits would carry an interest rate of between 14 and 16 percent, which were higher than those of the SUN.
Therefore, the banking sector had big interest to divert their SUN funds in credits to the production sector.
But the government should prepare conducive investment climate, taxation, labour and security systems as well legal certainty.
We have to be catious in channeling credits to customers because otherwise it is feard the credits would turn to be problematic, he added.

The raising of the BBI's rating reflected its strong business position following the presence of UOB as a major shareholder of BBIA, Pefindo said in a statement made available to ANTARA here Tuesday.

Pefindo, however, reported the rating was weakened by decrease in asset quality last year.
It said the bank's total assets reached Rp17.4 trillion in the first semester of 2006, accounting for about 1.2 percent of the total banking industry's assets.

The banking sector has begun lowering interest on both rupiah-and dollar-denominated deposits following the recent decision of Bank Indonesia the central bank and the Deposit Insurance Agency LPS to cut interest rates to 9.5 percent, an official said.
The decrease in lending interest was important for the business world and could encourage higher national economic growth, Hagabank Group financial division head Jenny Santosa said here Friday. 
She added, however, that the fast national economic growth depended not only on lower interest on deposits and the amount of bank credits extended but also on the government's efforts to boost the real sector's growth. 
The banking sector had predicted that the growth of credit expansion in 2007 might exceed the Bank Indonesia-set target of 18 percent, she said. 
This year is a good momentum for the banking sector to channel as much credits as possible after the government has set the economic growth target of 6.3 percent for this year, she said. 
She suggested that the government invest its funds in the productive sector so that the state budget would contribute to the economic development.
Jenny predicted that the lending interest would likely decrease from 14-15 percent to 12-13 percent provided that the BI rate dropped to 7-8 percent.

The Capital Market Supervisory Board- Financial Institutions Bapepam-LK of the Finance Ministry said state-owned gas company PT. Perusahaan Gas Nasional PGN proves to have violated existing rules on public information transparency. 
In a written statement released on Thursday, Bapepam-LK said through an investigation it had obtained enough evidence to prove that PT PGN had violated rule No X.K.1 on the obligation of companies to maintain openness in informing the public about their operations. 
It said Bapepam had already reviewed the relevant documents which it had collected from many parties. 
In addition, Bapepam-LK had also questioned some directors of the company, the company's public accountant, project coordinator and the manager of the SSWJ South Sumatra-West Java pipeline transmission project. 
Bapepam-LK had initiated a deeper probe into the case following indications that there was a violation of regulation in capital market in addition to violation of regulation No. X.K.1 including an investigation into transactions on PT. PGN shares conducted by a certain stock company. 
PGN's shares with PGAS code during trading at the Jakarta stock exchange BEJ on January 12 drastically went down.

In the meantime, the LQ45 index dropped 5.411 points or 1.48 percent to a position of 361.396. 
If there was no halting system at the Jakarta Stock Exchange, PGN's shares would possibly have continued to go down.

According to the statement, some $41 million of the funds will go to a program to empower farmers through a farmers group capacity development scheme and to an agriculture-based grant program.
The programs, it said, will hopefully help the Indonesian agricultural sector to grow by 3.9 percent and develop agricultural diversification so that in the long run the poverty rate will decrease.
The World Bank's country director for Indonesia, Andrew Steer, meanwhile, said revitalizing agricultural productivity may become the main effort to lower the poverty rate and strengthen the agricultural community. 
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Agriculture Ministry's Human Resources Development Agency head Ato Suprapto expressed hope that the World Bank loan would increase the number of Agricultural Information Posts BPP to 1,000-1,200 in sub districts across the country. 
Nowadays, he said, Indonesia had 5,815 BPPs although some of them had no office buildings and were sharing buildings with other agencies.
Therefore, the loan would also be used to build BPPs in 71 districts in 18 provinces, Ato said.

For the time being, there would be no public disclosure on the illegal activities of the perpetrators because police investigations are still underway , he said after attending a ceremony on the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Papua provincial administration and the BPKP.
But following investigations, certain circles felt they have caused the state a loss, and returned Rp781 million in state finances, he said.
In the meantime, BPKP chief Didi Widayadi said that if the case which had caused losses to the state has solid evidence, the culprits will be brought to justice.
Papua Governor Barnabas Suebu after receiving information and data from the BPKP, said the case must be followed up immediately.

The central government has allocated deconcentration fund amounting to Rp18.3 trillion for transportation development sector across the country in 2007, a minister has said.
Allocating the deconstration fund will hopefully narrow inter-region gap in infrastructure development, Coordinating Minister for Economy Boediono said in a document for the Regional Representatives Council DPD made available here Thursday.
According to the document, the government has also allocated a deconcentration fund of Rp4.6 trillion for irrigation sector, Rp1.99 trillion for flood management program, and Rp1.2 trillion for drinking water and wastes management projects.  
The deconcentration fund is the central government's money which is handed to the provincial administration for various development programs.
Aside from the deconcentration fund, State Budget 2007 has allotted fund amounting to Rp190 billion for border area development, Rp464 billion for strategic and growing zone development, Rp1.02 trillion for less-developed region development, and Rp847 billion for rural infrastructure and means development.
The document stated that other instrument which will be used to narrow inter-region gap is Public Allocation Fund DAU.
Quoting a latest study on DAU impact on regional disparity, Boediono said DAU 2006 brought better impact than previous DAU.
However, he said, there is still a room to improve DAU formula that in the long run it is more capable of further narrowing inter-region development gap. 
Boediono was also quoted as saying that the government provided 434 districts and towns with Special Allocation Fund DAK totaling Rp17 trillion which can be used to improve various infrastructures and means.
Some Rp5 trillion of the fund will be used to make roads and irrigation as well as to set up clean water facilities, Boediono was quoted as saying.
The Asian Development Bank ADB will fund a study on the quality of water in the Tarum Barat Canal which is meeting 80 percent of Jakarta's clean-water needs, a statement said.
In its official website on Friday, the ADB said the canal was in bad condition and the process of siphoning water from the canal for supply to Jakarta had been polluted over the past few years.
It said people living along the canal's banks and rivers flowing into the canal had polluted the canal water. 
According to the dispatch, the polluted condition of the water had increased the cost of purifying the water before it was distributed to consumers in Jakarta.
The study would be carried out over a period of 12 months in cooperation with clean water service provider Perum Jasa Tirta PJT 2 and a South Korean water firm co-sponsoring the study, it said.
Meanwhile, PJT 2 director Djendam Gurusinga said a study on the Citarum river had shown that most pollutants in the Citarum river came from industrial wastes and garbage generated by Bandung residents.
The results of the study on the Citarum river would be used as reference in efforts to improve the quality of the water in the Tarum Barat Canal and in the long term, the quality of water in some other rivers in the country, he said.  
Based on a study on about 20 rivers in the country, the ADB would make recommendations on how to improve the water quality, it said adding the efforts to improve water quality was part of ADB assistance to help the Indonesian government prepare a 15-year investment program and to promote an integrated water resources management system for the Citarum river flow.
The integrated Citarum water resources management program would begin late this year with the collaboration of the central government, the West Java administration, local people, the industrial sector and community organizations. 
A series of workshops held in 2006 formulated a vision that the government and local people should work together to create water catchment areas as well as clean and productive rivers that can give sustainable benefit to the people living along the Citarum river.
The workshops also produced a roadmap of a program focused on seven issues, namely institution of and planning for integrated water resources management, water resources development and management, water distribution, environmental protection, disaster management, people's empowerment and information management.
Last year, the ADB announced that it would raise water investment in Asia to US$2 billion per year to meet high demand for water in the region.
Sharia banks in Indonesia planned to raise in their credits to small and medium enterprises this year in view of the potential market of SMEs and increasing Bank Indonesia BI rate, an official said.
Sharia banks are predicted to increase their credits by 30 percent this year compared to last year's, Sharia Mandiri Bank BSM director Yuslam Fauzi said here Friday.
The recent drop in BI rate by 25 base points to 9.25 percent will likely lower sharia bank credit interest rates and encourage debtors to obtain fresh credits, he said.
Considering that the national economy has been growing steadily, we are optimistic that demand of SMEs for credits will also increase, he said.
Yuslam said, BSM will be more aggressive in providing SMEs with credits with a view to turning the banks into non-corporate sharia banks.
BSM had channeled Rp7.7 trillion to SMEs in 2006 and may allocate Rp10 trillion in 2007.
In 2006 third-party funds in BSM amounted to Rp8.219 trillion, assets Rp9.612 trillion and fundings Rp7.401 trillion. 
He also said BSM had opened three branches in Kalimantan, bringing the total number of BSM offices across the country to 225.
The Indonesian economy grew by 5.5 percent last year, down by 0.1 percent from a year earlier due to lower-than-expected investment, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said on Friday.
Overall, investment in 2006 was far lower than in previous years.
Investment which was originally expected to stimulate economic growth in 2006 remained stagnant, he said.
Investment rose to Rp800.1 trillion in 2006 from Rp657.6 trillion the year before, contributing only 0.7 percent of the 2006 economic growth, he said.
Investment in the construction sector rose by 8.9 percent, while investment in the machinery and equipment sector and investment in transport means fell by 25 percent and 42 percent respectively, he said. 
Overall, the 2006 economic growth was driven by exports 4.1 percent, followed by household consumption 1.9 percent, government consumption, and investment growth 0.7 percent.
Meanwhile, imports grew 2.8 percent to Rp870.1 trillion in 2006 from Rp816.4 trillion in 2005, he said.
It is the first time for components other than household consumption to make the biggest contribution to economic growth, he said.
He said a spate of natural disasters such as earthquakes engulfing Yogyakarta and flash floods hitting South Sulawesi this year were partly to blame for the lower-than-projected economic growth in 2006.
But the main engine of 2006 economic growth was the processing industry which contributed 1.3 percent to economic growth. Last year, the processing industry's growth registered a 4.6 percent increase from the figure a year earlier, he said.
Bank Indonesia BI or the central bank predicted that national economy would grow by six percent in 2007 or higher than the realization of economic growth which was recorded at 5.5 percent in 2006.
Economic growth in 2007 will likely to reach 5.7 to 6.3 percent with a median of 6 percent, Bank Indonesia governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said here Tuesday.
The predicted highest economic growth of 6.3 percent can be reached so long as the government is capable of implementing such structural agendas as investment climate improvement and law enforcement, he said.
He also said export flow will reach higher level this year compared to that of last year while import value will also high thanks to activity of investment in the second semester of this year. 
Import will rise so that the surplus of balance of payment will drop yet it is still able to keep rupiah exchange rate stability, he said.
The year 2007, he said, is the momentum to boost national economy as the country had already reached macro-economic stability in 2006.
So don't forsake this momentum as it is very dear.
We should utilize available macro-economic stability to bolster economic activity in 2007, he said.
Burhanuddin, however, said there are two things that may affect efforts to improve economic growth namely unpredictable world fuel oil price and spiraling rice price.
We have been making a research and study on agricultural commodity development notably rice.
Last year we predicted that skyrocketing rice price could bother our efforts to keep inflation rate from going further, he said. 
Data of the central bank showed that Indonesia successfully reached macro-economic stability in 2006 despite a heavy economic pressure in 2005.
Inflation rate which was recorded high in early 2006 slowly dropped to 6.6 percent late last year while the rupiah?s exchange rate has continued to become stable with low volatility, it said.
Publicly-listed information technology company PT Astra Graphia Tbk announced on Tuesday its net profit rose 54.1 percent to Rp55.56 billion in 2006 from Rp36.06 billion a year earlier on an increase in operational income and difference of the rupiah's exchange rate against the dollar.
Operational income rose 13.48 percent to Rp619.03 billion in 2006 from Rp545.46 billion the year before, according to the company's financial statement submitted to the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
The company earned Rp3.01 billion from the difference of the rupiah's exchange rate against the dollar last year, up from minus Rp3.04 billion a year earlier.
The 2006 profit raised earning per share to Rp41.20 from Rp26.74.
National banking sector is planning for a credit growth of 22 percent in 2007 or higher than the realization of banking credit growth of 14.1 percent in 2006, an official said.
Report on the bank credit growth has already been conveyed to Bank Indonesia.
The report shows that the national bank credit plan minus BPD will grow by 22 percent, central bank deputy governor Mulyaman D Hadad said here Tuesday.
National bank credit grew by 14 percent last year.
So, if it can raise 18 percent this year it will be good enough let alone if it reaches 22 percent, it will be very encouraging, he said. 
The bank credit scheme is a guide for the central bank to observation of banks' efforts to realize the plan, he said.
Half of the bank credit growth of 22 percent will be allotted to micro small medium enterprises UMKM sector.
Bank credit growth was recorded at 14.1 percent or Rp102.8 trillion in 2006, lower than 22.7 percent or Rp135.1 trillion in 2005.

PT Energi Mega Persada, Indonesia's second biggest oil company, is negotiating with several investors for possible sales of part of its stake in the Kangean gas block, East Java, its director said.
The company is in the process of negotiating with several strategic investors who have shown interest in cooperating with the company to develop the block, Norman Harahap told the Jakarta Stock Exchange here Wednesday.

Some bankers on Friday hailed the central bank's decision to ease credit rules to increase banks' intermediary role to boost the sluggish real sector.
The easing of credit rules is an opportunity for bankers to increase their intermediary role which currently falls short of expectations, PT Panin Bank Deputy Vice President Roosniati Salihin said on Friday.
Actually, banks were determined to distribute more banking credits this year than last year but many debtors refrained from making new bank loans, she said.
Banks prefered channeling credits to investing their funds in Bank Indonesia short-term promissory notes SBI because interest on banking credits was more profitable, she said.
She said many banks invested their funds in SBI which carries an interest rate of 9 percent merely to reduce cost risks.
Lending interest now ranges from 13 to 14 percent.
The high lending rate was one of the main factors discouraging consumers to apply for new credits and that banks must soon lower it, she said.
The government will likely raise the target of its global bond issuance to cover its extra budget deficit which may reach 1.5 percent of the gross national product GNPin 2007, State Minister for National Development Planning/National Development Planning Agency chairman Paskah Suzetta said.
The government may increase the number of its global and local bonds and try to secure more soft loans or international development assistance this year, he said here Wednesday.
I have told the public and private partners of the World Bank to provide Indonesia with soft loans or international development assistance to cover the deficit which may reach less than 2 percent this year, he said.
Paskah said the government will determine an extra deficit figure and a refinancing composition scheme in the revised 2007 State Budget.
In the 2007 State Budget, the government has projected a net income of Rp40.6 trillion and gross income of Rp66.8 trillion from the bond issuance.
The government has issued global bonds totalLing US$1.5 billion to cover the 0.7 percent or Rp26.1 trillion worth of gross national product in 2007.
The World Bank has supported the policy of Indonesia's central bank Bank Indonesia BI to maintain BI's interest rate at the level of 9.00 percent. 
Senior Economist of the World Bank in Indonesia William Wallace here Thursday said that the move of maintaining the BI rate was in accordance with the main task of the central bank to suppress the country's inflation rate and protect the exchange rate.
He believed that it would be easy for Bank Indonesia to lower the rate further, but the most important task of BI was to keep the inflation rate down because it could affect the interest rate, currency exchange rate and other variables. 
According to William Wallace, the current level was quite convenient given the other aspects of BI's main tasks.
He said that he would be careful in giving statement if he were BI.
If the lowering of the interest rate triggered an increase of money in circulation, the lowering trend could be slowed down, However, there was still room for further lowering, he said.
The Bank of Indonesia BI in its Governor Board Meeting RDG here on Thursday decided to maintain the level of the interest rate at 9.00 percent, which represented BI?s first decision of such a move since May 2006.
PT Panin Bank is planning to issue senior bonds worth Rp1.5 trillion in May to strengten capital and expand lending.
The bonds, divided into series A with a maturity of three years, series B five years and series C seven years, would go on sale between May 15 and 21, the bank's treasury director, Johnny Wiraatmadja, said on Thursday.
The series A bonds would carry an indicative interest of 9.25 percent to 9.75 percent, series B bonds 10.25 percent to 10.75 percent and series C bonds 10.50 percent to 11 percent, he said.

The bank was planning to channel 60 percent of its lending to the retail sector and open more than 50 branches in 2007, he said.
Coordinating Minister for the Economy Boediono said here on Monday the government would possibly increase its foreign debt this year to cover the national budget deficit which was predicted to surpass the target.
Yes, probably because the deficit is likely to increase this year and it has to be covered, he said, adding he had not yet seen budget deficit figures in detail.
Asked what the government had discussed with the World Bank at a meeting in Washington, the minister said it was not him but the state minister for national development planning who had attended the meeting.
I have to wait for him to know about it because I did not attend the meeting, he said. 
The finance minister stated earlier there was a possibility the government would seek a foreign loan through a bilateral or multilateral scheme to cover the 2007 budget deficit estimated to reach 1.5 to 1.8 percent or Rp56.9 to Rp68.3 trillion so long as the risk involved equaled those in other debt instruments.
So it is possible for us to seek a foreign loan if the deficit rises sharply.
We will seek the loan from reptable sources at home or abroad through bilateral or multilateral schemes so long as its terms are comparable to those set by other instruments, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said.
The deficit of 1.1 percent or Rp40.6 trillion in the 2007 national budger would be covered through the issuance of treasury bonds SUN worth Rp66.7 trillion gross and Rp40.6 trillion net.
Contributions from dividends meanwhile were expected to reach Rp14.462 trillion, privatization Rp2 trillion and sale of assets held by the Assets Managememt Company PPA Rp1.5 trillion.
Most 70 percent of the budget for poverty eradication management would come from foreign loans, Boediono said.
Next year, we will possibly raise the allocation of funds which mostly may come from our own sources.
It is a combination, he said.
He said there had been improvements in the implementation of poverty eradication programs that had been carried out since 1999 so that they had been treated as government programs.
The World Bank has been implementing a variety of poverty eradication programs in sub districts since 1999 and we have improved them he said.
The undisbursed bank credits in Central Java by February 2007 reached Rp7.1 trillion, accounting for 13.71 percent of the total bank credits of Rp52.1 trillion.
Director of Semarang's Bank Indonesia BI office Amril Arief said here on Monday that the undisbursed loans reflected a 14.64 increase compared to the undisbursed Rp6.2 trillion in December 2006.
This unfavorable situation is an indication that the real sector in starting with their business operations has not done enough, in spite of the banking financial support.
This is quite deplorable, he said.
He also revealed that the total bank assets in February 2007 increased by 17 percent to Rp83.7 trillion, third-party funds by 15.22 percent to Rp67.1 trillion, and credits by 13.04 percent to Rp52.1 trillion.
Dengan pertumbuhan kredit yang lebih rendah dari pertumbuhan DPK, membuat loans to deposit ratio LDR turun dari 79,13 persen menjadi 77,64 persen, sedangkan rasio nonperforming loans NPLs naik dari 4,92 persen menjadi 6,06 persen.
He said that consumer credits increased by 16.41 percent to Rp17.9 trillion, work capital by 12.02 percent to Rp30 trillion, but investment credits by only 5.45 percent to Rp4.2 trillion.
Nevertheless, he added, work capital credits are still the biggest contributor to the total credits, with 57.56 percent, consumer credits 34.47 percent, and investment credits 7.96 percent.
Under these circumstances, the central bank BI called on the banks to increase their credits to support the national economic growth and at the same time to apply the principle of prudential banking properly, enabling them to better manage their credit risks, he said.

The rupiah at the Jakarta Inter Bank Spot Market strenghtened by five points in the afternoon to Rp9,075/9,080 from Rp9,080/9,085 against the US dollar on the previous day after market agents released the US greenback and bought the Indonesian unit. 
The market agents who released rupiah in the morning session released US dollars and bought the Indonesian currency before the closing session in the afternoon, PT Bank Mega's Retail Banking Director Kostaman Thayib said here Friday.
However, the market agents bought only a small amount of rupiah so that the increase in the rate of the Indonesian currency was also relatively small, he said.
He added that the increase was also supported by Bank Indonesia the central bank which prevented rupiah from passing the psychological limit of Rp9,100 per US dollar.
The central bank wanted rupiah to stay at a rate between Rp9,050 and Rp9,075 per US dollar, he said, adding that the market agents bought rupiah because they saw the positive issue as the US dollar strenghthened against Japanese yen. 
The US dollar strengthened because investors were waiting for data on the US economic growth which would be reported by the US central bank, he said.
He noted that the yen weakened because the Japanese central bank decided not to raise its interest rate in the near future prompting foreign agents to release the Japanese unit. 
The Yen weakened to the US dollar to 119.65 compared to the previous rate of 119.55, he said. 
He further said the market was now focusing its attention on the issuance of data on the US economy in the January-March period.
The US economy in the first quarter of this year was predicted to grow 1.8 percent, a decrease since 2005.
We are optimistic that the rupiah will remain below Rp9,100 against the US dollar, he said.
Bank Indonesia BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said here on Wednesday the central bank would strive to lower its reference interest rate to 8.5 percent, the figure assumed in the 2007 State Budget. 
The target in our mind is to lower it to 8.5 percent but we will see how the dymanics will be, he said after attending the swearing in of new cabinet ministers and attorney general at the presidential palace.
He said the room for lowering the BI rate further was still quite big in view of the dynamics of the country's economic growth.
If the dynamics of growth is like this while international liquidity is abundant and the inflation target is likely to be met, I think the rate may still be lowered.
By how much it can be cut will depend on coming month-to-month developments, he said.
Burhanuddin said however he also saw problems that could hinder efforts to lower the rate to reach 8.5 percent such as the target of five percent plus and minus one percent inflation in 2008.
The target is quite hard to achieve because the idea of double-digit inflation has long been rooted in the people's minds, he said.
To change the mindset, he said BI would strive to ensure that the inflation rate would be one digit or even lower.
How far the inflation rate would be lowered Burhanuddin said it would be compared to that in the country's rivals such as Thailand and Malaysia.
If it could reach four to five percent it will be good for the economy, he said.
Bank Indonesia BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said here on Wednesday the central bank would maintain the rupiah's exchange rate at between Rp8,500 and Rp9,500 against the US dollar.
He said the recent appreciation of the national currency is still within a range in line with Bank Indonesia's survey.
We are still quite comfortable .
He said according to a BI survey conducted on 400 exporters and importers in the country, the ideal range for the rupiah's exchange rate was Rp8,500 to Rp9,500 per US dollar.
Burhanuddin said the sharp rise in the rupiah's value this week reaching Rp8,670 per dollar had occurred following a big flow of funds from overseas.
We continue to maintain the volatility of the rupiah's exchange rate, he said adding that the rupiah's recent appreciation was attributed to international funds that were seeking places for investment and Indonesia proved to be still attractive.
Indonesia will ask the World Bank, the Asian Developemnt Bank ADB and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation JBIC to disburse all the aid commitments of its donor countries totaling US$1.75 billion to cover a deficit in its 2007 state budget, a development planning official said. 
Syahrial said the deficit was meanwhile expected to increase to 1.5 - 1.8 percent but the government had at present no plan to seek additional loans to cover the extra shortfall. 
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani and National Development Planning Minister Paskah Suzetta have said if the deficit increases, the extra deficit should be covered with foreign loans only if efforts to raise funds from other sources fail, Syahrial said.
He said the increase in the deficit could be covered with money saved through greater efficiency in spending and the issuance of state debentures.
If these efforts failed, steps could be taken to obtain more foreign laons.
The US$1.75 billion loans consisted of 600 million dollars from the World Bank, one billion dollars from the Asian Development Bank and the remaining one from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.
Bank Indonesia BI will keep safeguarding the volatility of the country's currency, the rupiah, which continues to strengthen and now has reached Rp8,750 against the US dollar.
We will never announce the tolerable range of the volatility but we will continue to control it because volatility may cause uncertainty which is not good for the economy, BI Senior Deputy Governor Miranda Gultom said here on Monday. 
She said BI did not want the rupiah to appreciate or to weaken abruptly and therefore, as you have seen BI sometimes intervenes to prevent a sharp rise .
Miranda declined to tell if BI would soon take action to slow down the rupiah's appreciation or to lead it to a certain level.
She said the current appreciation would improve the balance sheet in companies that had overseas debts.
It will also automatically improve inflation as inflation will drop if the prices of imported goods and investment decline, she said.
She said in the short term the appreciation would dampen inflation and boost economic growth.
A rupiah appreciation always carries connotations of improving indicators of the economy as a whole.
That is the main indicator of a country's economy so that we hope the economy will be better as a result of the appreciation and sentiment is also improving, she said.
Miranda said based on its study BI concluded there was a positive relationship between the rupiah's appreciation and the economy and inflation.
According to BI calculations an appreciation of one percent will create 0.05 growth and depress inflation by 0.07 percent or in other words a ten percent appreciation will create 0.5 percent growth and a 0.7 percent inflation decline, she said. 
Miranda said in the long term the appreciation if responded to well would not cause inflation pressure.
The appreciation, if followed by improving expenditures of the government and companies and infrastructure in the long term will also increase supply and if supply is increasing in the long term, inflation expectation will decrease, she said. 
She said BI would support indicators that could bring inflation down.
Integrated timber processing industry company PT Barito Pacific Timber BRPT has stopped operating PT Mangole Timber Producers, a subsidiary in Mangole island in North Maluku province, a spokesperson has said.

Indonesian rating company PT Pefindo has given publicly-listed recreational park firm PT Pembangunan Jaya Ancol PJAA and its Rp200 billion worth of bond `idA+', a spokesperson has said.
The rate showed that PJAA had strong market position, stable income, very conservative capital structure and very strong cash flow protection, Pefindo analyst Andi Setiawan said here Tuesday.
However, he said, legal affairs potential in property business and lack of growth potential in recreational business segment had weakened the rate.

Bank Indonesia Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said he was optimistic the Indonesian Interest Rate SBI would reach between 7.5 and 8.0 percent in 2008.
He said after meeting with members of the House of Representatives' Commission XI here on Tuesday the target would be reached following improvements in the world economy in terms of liquidity or macro-economic conditions.
He said there would also still be the possibility for the central bank to conduct monetary operations to meet the target.
We see the possibilities for the monetary operations at home.
Based on calculations, it is possible for us to lower the SBI to 7.5 or 8.0 percent, he said.
According to a government projection, global economic growth will slow down a bit from 5.4 percent in 2006 to 4.9 percent this year.
Bank Indonesia this year had lowered the rate four times.

The House of Representatives DPR agreed to a number of macro economic assumptions for 2008 in a working meeting with the government here on Monday, Economic growth in 2008 was estimated at 6.5-6.9 percent, inflation 5.5-6.5 percent, interest on Bank Indonesia short-term promissory notes SBI 7-8 percent and the rupiah's exchange rate Rp9,100-Rp9,400 per US dollar.
Earlier, the House's Commission XI on finance, national development planning, banking industry, and non-bank financial institutions considered the government-set economic growth target of 6.6-7.0 percent for 2008 too high and proposed what its said was the realistic growth rate of 6.5-6.9 percent. 
In response, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said if the government-proposed economic growth of 6.6-7.0 percent for next year was lowered, the inflation rate might slightly be lower than 6.0-6.5 percent as projected before.
In our view, the moderate figure is 5.5-6.5 percent, she said.
Both the government and the House agreed to the rupiah's assumed exchange rate of Rp9,100-Rp9,400 per US dollar, particularly when it came to the prospects for the balance of payments.
Since the 2008 inflation rate was expected to fall short of the projection, the SBI rate might decline to a range of 7.0-8.0 percent from 7.5-8.0 percent as originally proposed, Sri Mulyani said.
The House's Commission XI only discussed macro economic assumptions related to economic growth, inflation rate, SBI rate, and the rupiah's exchange rate, while those related to oil prices and production were to be discussed in a meeting between the government and the House Commission VII on energy and mineral resources, research and technology and the environment.
The results of the meeting between House Commission XI and the government will be referred to a meeting of the House's Budgetary Committee for approval.

We noticed that the amount of PT Indosat's tax payments has been declining in the last several years, It is worth noting why it happened, the director general told media editors here on Tuesday night.
He said that his office had been told by PT Indosat about the reasons why the amount of its tax payments declined but it still needed to gather more inforamtion and recheck it following lagislator Dradjad H Wibowo's revelation of that matter.
Let's collect and assess the information, We will take actions if we find any indication, Nasution said.
But the taxation director general stopped short of making more detailed comments on the matter.
As a result, the government lost potential tax revenues worth Rp323 billion.
Wibowo of the House's Financial Affairs Commission suspected that PT Indosat had embazzled taxes by filling a report of losses from derivatives transactions made from 2004 to 2006.
This, Wibowo said, is apparent in Indosat's consolidated balance sheet which has an item on loss on change in fair value of derivatives, which in 2004 showed a loss of Rp170.45 billion, Rp44.21 billion in 2005, and Rp438 billion in 2006.
Indosat's total losses as the result of the derivatives transactions covering a period of three years amounted to Rp653 billion.
These, however, have yet to be audited, and therefore can change.
But these losses are still a financial scandal which cannot be tolerated, he pointed out.
The number of individual tax payers in Indonesia increased by only 200,000 to 300,000 a year during the past five years, the country's top tax official said. 
In addition, only about 33 percent to 34 percent of them pay their taxes regularly, Darmin Nasution, director general of taxes, told media editors here on Tuesday night.
The number of individual tax payers was increasing at a very slow pace as at the end of 2006 it stood at only 3.3 million, and only 2.9 million of them were effective tax payers, Darmin said.
He said the slowness in the increase in the number of individual tax payers was due to the fact that the directorate general of taxes had not yet provided maximum service to the people while the people's desire to pay taxes was still low.
Nasution said if Indonesia's population was 220 million, the number of individual tax payers should be at least between 20 million and 25 million.
In order to increase the number of tax payers the directorate general was trying to modernize its taxation services and extensify its tax-base sources.
We will improve our services, provide facilities and develop a database and administration system, he said.
Robert Zoellick, the presumed next head of the World Bank, will shoulder the task of rebuilding trust in the development lender after a scandal at the top exposed deep divisions.
US President George W. Bush nominated Zoellick to succeed World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz, who was forced to resign over a favoritism scandal involving his companion, a bank employee.

Local rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia Pefindo has reaffirmed its idA- stable outlook rating for leasing company PT Indomobil Finance Indonesia for a period of January 19, 2007 to May 1, 2008, Pefindo director Urip Suprodjo said.
The rating was based on financial data and information provided by the company and its audited financial statement ended on December 31, 2006, he said.
A company with an idA rating has stronger financial support than any other Indonesian obligor to meet its long-term financial obligations but is fairly sensitive to detrimental situation, he said.
The mark - indicates that the rating was relatively weak and below the average category of its kind.
Bank Indonesia BI is urging banks to increase their credits for sugarcane-based industries, BI Deputy Governor Muliaman D. Hadad said here on Tuesday.
Banks' role in providing credits for sugarcane-based industries has remained small because the industries have not shown their real potentials, the central bank deputy governor said on the sidelines of a seminar on the prospects and financing of sugarcane-based industries.
He said there were actually a lot of banks which had provided credits for sugar industries, This was because the industries' non-performing loan level was low and they had good prospects not only in sugar production but also in the making of down-stream products such as ethanol
Muliaman said BI had recorded that a total of 32 banks had financed projects in this sector with credits totaling Rp1.6 trillion, He said the credit amount was relatively big but it still could be increased further, After all, this sector had good potentials
Banks have begun to understand and to provide relatively big credits after these industries' experience was exposed to them, he said.
He said the sugarcane-based industires non-performing loan ratio was also small, namely only 0.33 percent in the plantation sector and 2.11 percent in sugarcane industries and its down-stream actvities.
The industries also needed support in the form of clear policies with regard to environmental impact analyses in accordance with their condition without sacrificing the environment.
The prospect of the financing in this sector was categorically bright as these industries needed some Rp8.3 trillion in the 2005-2010 period throughout the country.
But the BI official also said the problem faced by these industries did not only have to do with financing but also with technical aspects. 
The problems are not only related to financing but also to techincal aspects which we and other relevant agencies have to think of, this of course will need coordination, he said.
The value of the rupiah against the US dollar on the Jakarta Inter Bank Spot Market on Tuesday afternoon dropped to approach the level of 9,100 per US$ as market agents actively bought the US greenback.
Trading in the Indonesian unit was closed at Rp9,063/9,070 against the US dollar compared to Rp9,023/9,045 on the previous day or weaker by 40 points.
Retail Banking Director of PT Bank Mega Tbk publicly listed Kostaman Thayib said the rupiah was under greater pressure on the market as state companies actively bought US dollars to pay debts that had matured.  
Therefore, market pressure was stronger causing the rupiah to drop although there was an external rumor that the Japanese yen was strengthening against the US dollar. 
He said the yen had strengthened after the Japanese finance minister reminded the market of the recent drop in the Japanese currency.  
We are optimistic that the yen will continue to strengthen to the position of 110 which constitutes the psychological border figure as the position of the yen is now still far over the level of 120, he said. 
The US dollar weakened by 0.2 percent against the yen to 123.40 yen and the euro also weakened to 166.05 or dropped by 0.25 percent.  
According to him, the strengthening yen would have a positive impact on the domestic money market, especially the rupiah but the positive external factor did not happen. 
Such a condition occurred because market agents still focused on the purchase of US dollar to meet their needs, he said.
He pointed out that the rupiah could reach the level of 9,100 to the US dollar as at that level the rupiah exchange rate was considered still stable. 
However, the Indonesian currency still has the opportunity to rebound if the Japanese central bank BOJ and the US central bank The Fed was certain to increase their interest rates.
BOJ would raise its interest rate to make yen continue to strengthen as its position was now still far over the level of 110, and The Fed would also do the same to curb the inflation which tended to rise, he said. 
We are awaiting the local agents' reactions to the improving yen which is expected to give positive impacts to rupiah, he added.  
The rupiah is now corrected as the regional share market is weakening due to the decrease in the stocks of Wall Street, while the market agents worry about the US market which tends to drop, Kostaman said.
Publicly-listed telecommunications operator PT Bakrie Telecom Tbk said on Tuesday it has secured a syndicated loan of US$145 million from foreign financial institutions.

The government will propose an additional budget of Rp500 billion to Rp600 billion for the construction of infrastructure that had been damaged by the mudflow of Lapindo Brantas mining company in Sidoarjo, East Java.
The government has made a request to the House of Representatives for additional budget of Rp 500 billion to Rp 600 billion for the rehabilitation damaged infrastructure, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said at a socialization of the proper management of government accounts at the different ministries and agencies, here on Wednesday.
The minister said that the additional funds would be proposed by the Public Works Ministry through the 2007 revised state budget.
The funds are for damaged infrastructure rehabilitation, the budget implementation list DIPA is in the hand of the Minister of Public Works, she said.
Mulyani said that based on Presidential Decree No. 14/ 2007 on the Sidoarjo Mudflow Handling Agency BPLS, the government was responsible for the repair and rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure which affected the people's life and the national economy such as roads and railway tracks.
Because of flooding and bing covered by mud, the infrastructure like roads and rail tracks can no longer function, and have to be rehabilitated or relocated.
As it now has entered the year 2007, we will propose an additional budget allocation in the revised 2007 state budget to the House of Representatives DPR through the Public Works Ministry, the finance minister said.
On the occasion the minister also said that the government would not bail out compensation funds for the mudflow victims.
There is no bail out fund, she added.
Previously, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said the government would not lend money for paying compensations to the victims of mudflow from PT Lapindo Brantas operations in Porong, Sidoarjo, East Java.
Actually there has been an idea of the government to lend money, but it would no longer be necessary, because PT Lapindo Brantas is able to make the payments, he said at a press conference after a meeting to discuss the handling of the disaster.
The Indonesian government last year canceled 11 foreign-funded projects across the country for various reasons, the Finance Ministry said.
The Danish-funded project worth 21.96 million euros was canceled due to the absence of a permit from the Office of the State Enterprises Minister, it said.
The two projects which involved the Health Ministry were canceled because of failure to use up the total loans until the end of loan period.
One of the ADB-funded projects was Metro Medan Urban Development Project worth US$5.82 million of the total US$82.8 million pledged, The project run by the Public Works Ministry was canceled because it had already been closed.
The other ADB-funded project was Small Medium Enterprise Export Development Project worth US$72.83 million of the total US$85 million pledged, The project run by the Directorate General of Treasury at the Finance Ministry was canceled because the executing bank failed to distribute funds to small and medium enterprises
The JBIC-funded project was Ciliwung-Cisadane River Flood Control Project worth US$16.91 million of the total US$17.33 million pledged. The project was canceled because of problems related to land clearance.
PT Charoen Pokphand Indonesia Tbk at a shareholders' general meeting here on Wednesday decided to distribute dividends worth Rp38 per share.

The Finance Ministry has projected the state budget deficit in the second aemester of 2007 at Rp59.92 trillion with expenditure estimated at Rp458.02 trillion or 60 percent of the 2007 state budget, and revenues at Rp398.10 trillion 55.1 percent.
The state expenditure forecast consists of the central government's expenditure estimated at Rp320.56 trillion 63.5 percent and regional governments' expenditure projected at Rp137.461 trillion 53.1 percent, according to the second-half state budget prognosis, a copy of which was made available on Friday. 
The higher absorption of the central government's budget in the second semester of 2007 has to do with the start of physical projects and the disbursement of electricity subsidy due to an increase in the production cost of power supplies, the report said.
The state revenue projection consists of tax receipts projected at R284.257 trillion 55.8 percent, non-tax state revenues estimated at Rp111.503 trillion 52.9 percent and grants projected at Rp2.342 trillion 87.8 percent.
The higher state revenue and grant projections in the second semester of 2007 are due among others to developments in macro economic variables; measures to revise tax, customs and excise arrangements and procedures; as well as measures to revise the system and procedure of paying non-tax state revenues, the report said.
To offset the Rp59.92 trillion deficit, the ministry has projected domestic funding at Rp39.389 trillion 71.5 percent and foreign funding at Rp9.887 trillion minus 67.9 percent.
The report said Rp10.823 trillion of the domestic funding will originate from the domestic banking industry, Rp4.7 trillion from the privatization of state firms, Rp521.7 billion from the sale of banks' assets under the restructuring program, and Rp28.044 trillion from the issuance of state bonds, minus Rp2.7 trillion as a result of state capital participation.
Foreign funding would come from disbursement of program loans worth Rp19.11 trillion and project loans worth Rp20.184 trillion, minus Rp29.40 trillion in instalments on foreign debts.
The government is optimistic about achieving the economic growth target of 6.3 percent for 2007 although the state expenditure in the first half of this year is projected to reach 37.8 percent of the state budget, a minister said.
I am optimistic that the economy will expand 6.3 percent in 2007, State Minister for National Development Planning Paskah Suzetta said here at the weekend.
He said the 2007 economic growth would be driven not only by state expenditure but also by exports, imports, public consumption and private investment.
Earlier, the government announced that the state expenditure in the first semester of 2007 is projected to reach Rp288.4 trillion or 37.8 percent of the state budget amounting to Rp763.6 trillion.
The government said the central government's expenditure in the first half of 2007 is estimated at Rp173.3 trillion 34.3 percent and the regional governments' expenditure at Rp115.1 trillion 44.5 percent.
The central government's expenditure included goods spending which reached Rp15.1 trillion 20.9 percent and capital spending which reached Rp12.3 trillion 16.8 percent.
Paskah, who is also chairman of the National Development Planning Board Bappenas said both goods and capital spending was very low on the early days of the budget year but the spending began to increase in the second quarter up to the fourth quarter of this year.
Earlier, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the 2007 economic growth would be about the same as the initial forecast of 6.3 percent, to be helped by public consumption growth of 5.1 percent, government consumption growth of 8.9 percent, investment growth of 12.3 percent, export growth of 9.9 percent, and import growth of 14.2 percent.
The economy is projected to expand 6-6.1 percent in the first half of 2007, fueled by public consumption growth of 4.7 percent, government consumption growth of 6.6 percent, investment growth of 9.9 percent, export growth of 9.3 percent, and import growth of 12.3 percent.
The minister hoped the economy would expand 6.4-6.6 percent in the second semester of 2007 with public consumption expected to grow 5.6 percent, government consumption 11.1 percent, investment 14.6 percent, export 10.6 percent, and import 15.9 percent.
Indonesian rating agency Pefindo has upgraded the rating of PT Kalbe Farma Tbk KLBF and its 1/2006 bonds worth Rp300 billion to idAA from idAA- with a stable outlook, an analyst said. 
The idAA rating reflected the company's strong market position, good diversification of product portfolio and better financial performance, Pefindo analyst Vonny Widjaja said on Monday. 
However, the rating was limited by a slow sale growth in 2006, she said. 
KLBF is currently Indonesia's largest pharmacy company which is supported by several subsidiaries namely PT Bintang Toedjoe, PT Hexpharm Jaya, PT Saka Farma, PT Finusolprima and PT Dankos Farma. 
PT Kalbe Farma is also engaged in several other businesses such as in health food production through PT Sanghiang Perkasa, in distribution services through PT Enseval Putera Megatrading Tbk and in packaging services through PT Kageo Igar Jaya Tbk, she said. 
Per March 31, 2007, KLBF's share holders consist of PT Gira Sole Prima 9.43 percent, PT Santa Seha Sanadi 8.94 percent, PT Lucasta Murni Cemerlang 8.76 percent, PT Diptanala Bahana 8.65 percent, PT Bina Artha Charisma 7.32 percent, PT Ladang Ira Panen 7.31 percent and the public 49.59 percent. 
KLBF intended to buy back not more than 10 percent of shares that the company had released with a total fund of about Rp1.23 trillion, Vonny said.
Up to March 31, 2007, the company managed to buy back shares worth Rp23 billion, or about two percent of its target.
Stock rating agency PT Pefindo has assigned an idA- rating to publicly-listed telecommunications firm PT Bakrie Telecom Tbk. and its plan to issue bonds worth Rp750 billion to finance part of its capital expenditure.
The rating reflected profitable telecommunication industry, proper business model and potential business growth, Pefindo analyst Niken Indriarsih said in a statement on Monday.
But she added the rating remained fragile due to the company's aggressive expansion leading to high financial leverage, and high exposure to foreign currency risks including domestic stiff competition. 
As of March 31, 2007, Bakrie Telecom is 50.25 percent owned by PT Bakrie & Brothers Tbk., 15.08 percent by CMA Fund Management, 3.17 percent by PT Bakrie Communications, 2.08 percent by Richweb Investments Ltd., and 29.43 percent by the public.
Bank Indonesia BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said on Monday the central bank is optimistic the economy will grow by more than 6 percent this year, citing robust lending growth as a reason.
Apart from that, with the state budget realization rate expected to improve in the third and fourth quarters, economic growth is likely to exceed the figure, Burhanuddin said following a meeting of the bank's board of governors here on Monday.
The meeting agreed that the economy would perform better in the second semester, he said.
The economy in the two previous quarters was on the right track and it would continue to expand during the rest of the year, he said.
He believed full-year inflation rates would hit the central bank's inflation target of 6, plus or minus 1, percent for 2007 and of 5, plus or minus 1, percent for 2008.
Stock rating agency PT Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia Pefindo has upgraded the rating of packaged food industry PT Mayora Indah Tbk and its bond due in July 2008 to A+ stable outlook from A.
The A+ rating reflects the good market for the company's packaged foods, as evident from its sales which grew by 73.48 percent in the first quarter of 2007 from a year earlier, Pefindo analyst Niken Indriarsih said here Tuesday.
The rating was however weakened by increasing cost of raw materials, she said.
Mayora is 32.93 percent owned by PT Unita Branindo, and 67.07 percent by the public.
Publicly-listed PT Bakrie Sumatra Plantation Tbk has set up a joint venture company, Agri Resources BV, with several foreign investors to expand its oil palm plantation area.
We plan to conduct extensive expansion with a target of increasing our plantations by 100,000 hectares within six years' time.
We just received US$250 million worth of funds which are certainly very significant for implementing our plan, the company's president director, Ambono Janurianto, said here on Tuesday.
He said his company had a 20-percent share in the new company which is based in the Netherlands by paying around US$10 million in participation capital. 
The other US$90 million of the capital was paid by foreign investment companies and another US$150 million from senior secured notes issued by AI Finance BV, an affiliated company set up by the investors' partners in Singapore.
Ambono said on June 26 he had signed a document relating to capital participation in the Agri Resources BV that plans to acquire several plantation companies in the country.
As an initial step he said Agri Resources BV recently acquired a plantation company that holds 36,000 hectares of land in the southern part of Sumatra with 19,000 of them already planted, adding 75 percent of the trees in the planted area was already mature.
Ambono said the joint venture company had entrusted Bakrie Sumatra Plantation Tbk to manage plantation companies it would acquire based on a management agreement.
We enjoy direct advantage through a management fee of US$100 per hectare per year from every plantation we manage, he said.
He said Bakrie would also get a marketing fee of US$10 per ton of crude palm oil and US$5 per ton of palm kernel sold based on an off-take agreement.
We are optimistic the series of transactions that we have made will bring much benefit not only in terms of corporate financial performance but also income and operational performance, he said.
He said Bakrie itself expected to increase its plantation area by at least 7,000 hectares by the end of this year.
Publicly-listed nickel company PT International Nickel Indonesia INCO said it would extend its cooperation with publicly-listed national diversified mining firm PT Antam.
The current cooperation agreement with Antam will expire next year but we have agreed to extend our association, INCO President Director Arif S Siregar said here Wednesday.
Under the cooperation agreement signed in February 2003 Antam had been buying nickel ore from INCO's work contract area in Pomalaa Timur in Southeast Sulawesi to support its ferronickel production activity in Pomalaa.
PT Antam had since mid-2005 bought a total of 1 million tons of nickel ore from PT INCO.
Arif also said INCO would build the Karebbe dam in Pomalaa district starting next month to increase the capacity of its hydropower plant from 275 MW to 365 MW.
The Karebbe dam project would cost US$275 million to US$580 million and was expected to be completed in mid-2010, he said.
Indonesia could have been stronger than China, India or Japan in economic terms because it had the advantage of possessing a wide variety of natural resources, Vice President Jusuf Kalla said. 
During my overseas trips this year, I witnessed the economic progress many countries including China, India, and Japan are making.
But there was never any doubt in my mind that we could have made faster progress than other countries because not many of them are endowed with as wide a variety of natural resources as we are, Kalla said in his address at a seminar on Mid-2007 Economic Projections here on Thursday.
The vice president said Indonesia's economic strength lay in the world's economic weaknesses in terms of natural resources.
The world's economic weaknesses are limited energy sources, shortage of commodities and also of metals.
These three weaknesses in the world economy are our gain because not many countries have an abundance of energy sources, commodities and metals as we do.
We have oil, coal and many other natural resources, Kalla said. 
He said when gas wells in Natuna and Cepu had come on stream next year, Indonesia would again have an energy surplus. 
We also have a lot of commodities.
In spite of the recent increase in the cooking oil price, only 30 percent of production poses a problem while the remaining 70 percent is our gain, Kalla said, adding that the 30 percent was needed at home and was exchanged with export duty.
The vice president predicted that the prices of cocoa, corn and coffee would rise and thereby stengthen the Indonesian economy. 
The government's present policy should be reversed.
Bank Indonesia BI has given telecommunications company Telkomsel permission to market its E-Money products, a BI official said.
The license has been issued, the central bank's director of accounting and payment systems, Dyah NK Makhijani, said here on Saturday at a central bank discussion on national payment systems for economic journalists and banking staff.
He said the central bank issued the permit after considering the Telkomsel's capability to issue the products.
Besides performance, they Telkomsel also have more than two years of experience in providing pre-paid and post-paid cellulair telephone services, he said.
She said BI was currently promoting non-cash transactions through the use of an E-Money card in economic transactions in the country.
More than 100 million people in the productive-age group in the country were currently only making an average of 12 non-cash transactions a year.
This is very small, she said.
Therefore, she hoped the development in the use of E-Money would change cash to non-cash transactions so that circulation of cash money would be reduced to economize on the printing of bills.
An E-Money card is similar to a credit card which can be used for transactions like paying toll road fees and restaurant bills and other expenses.
Bank Permata posted an unaudited profit of Rp289 billion in the first semester of 2007, up 41 percent from Rp205 billion in a corresponding period in 2006, a spokesperson said.
Its net profit after tax in the first six months of this year was recorded at Rp198 billion or 39 percent more than Rp143 billion in the same period of last year, the bank's president director, Steward D. Hall, said here Monday.
He said the increased net profit was supported by a raise in net interest rate and net non-interest rate income.
The bank's loan-to-deposit ratio LDR reached 83 percent as of last June 30, an increase of 74 percent compared to the figure in a corresponding period the previous year, The two figures were higher compared to the national LDR level which stood at 64 percent.

The Jakarta Stock Exchange JSX has temporarily suspended Bank Negara Indonesia share trading until further notice, an official said here Wednesday.
The suspension was designed to avoid uncontrollable fluctuations in the Bank BNI share price following its second initial public offering, JSX trade division head Hamdi Hassyarbaini said.
The bourse, he said, was continuously asking information from BNI on the suspension.
Bank BNI sold 3.47 billion shares at the price of Rp2,050 per share beginning Tuesday.

Indonesia's biggest glaze producer PT Ferro Mas Dinamika is one of the industries which are planning to increase their production capacity, Bambang Sugiyaro, a senior manager at the company, said here Wednesday.
Our company is making efforts to raise its production capacity to 1,100 tons per day after PT PGN promised to supply 1.2 million cubic meters of gas a month, he said.   
The US company had reduced its production capacity sharply for the past three years due to limited gas supply.
It had even reduced its production capacity by 50 percent last year.
Meanwhile, foodware ceramic manufacturer PT Narumi Indonesia president director Hisashi Sato said his company would also step up production capacity following the beginning of PGN gas supply through the SSWJ distribution system.
The Cikarang-based PT Narumi Indonesia which uses cowbones as raw material for food ware ceramic industry had been relying on expensive liquefied petroleum gas or LPG for the past three years.
Sato said his firm was planning to increase its production capacity by 150 percent next year after PGN started channeling its gas through the SSWJ pipes.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has asked state-owned bank BNI to continue its divestment and right issue although the world's stock markets were fluctuating.
The president asked that the process be continued in accordance with initial plans and he said he had no problem with it, Minister for State Enterprises Sofyan Djalil said here on Thursday.
The minister met with the president in order to report the divestment process of state bank BNI.
He said that the president suggested that the divestment process be continued because the prices BNI offered for its shares were already at the optimum level in the current market conditions.
The minister said that the president was satisfied with his report and understood the market condition as well as the process of BNI's divestment process.
The price is set based on our announcement and our estimates at Rp4 trillion to cover the state budget, he said.
It has now been oversusbscribed.
And there would be no more change under whatever condition so that the government and BNI's revenues from the divestment were guaranteed because it was fully guaranteed by underwriters, he added.
He said that the global market would shortly improve as seen Thursday morning where global stocks gained strength at about 1.5 to 2.5 percent.
The Jakarta stock composite also gained a strength.
We hope it would improve on Friday and Monday based on our expectation, the BNI director said.
In going public, BNI would carry out two parts of its going public activities namely offering 15 percent right issue for BNI's additional capital and 15 percent divestment of government shares.
But of the 30 percent, only 26 percent would be floated in the stock exhange.
Sigit said that the price per share of the right issue was set at Rp2,025, while the price per share of the divestment was fixed at Rp2,050.
The government is likely to find it hard to meet investment needs in 2008 to achieve the economic growth target of 6.8 percent, a lawmaker said.
The challenges to meet the investment needs will come from the government itself.
One of the challenges will be the low absorption of the state budget, spokesman of the United Development Party faction in the House of Representatives DPR Syumli Syadli said here Tuesday.
Syumli made the remarks when delivering the faction's general views on the draft 2008 state budget and the government's financial notes in a House plenary session here.
To achieve the economic growth target of 6.8 percent for 2008, a gross fixed capital of Rp1,296 trillion would be needed, he said.
The government expects private investment in 2008 to reach Rp168.48 trillion or 35.5 percent of the total.
The banking sector is expected to contribute Rp168.48 trillion 13 percent to the investment needs next year, state enterprises 11.7 percent, infrastructure projects 7 percent and other investments 22.5 percent.
Although the government investment is small, it will play a greater role in spurring the real sector's growth as much of the state spending will go to labour-intensive projects, he said.
To achieve the economic growth target of 6.8 percent for 2008 the government would need a direct investment of US$100 billion, he said.
However, most of investment inflows had so far been in the form of portfolio investment which was susceptible to turbulence in the financial sector, he said.
We must realize that the lower-than-expected government investment is much caused by domestic factors, namely the government's inconsistency in managing many sectors which have so far impeded investment inflows, he said.
He said rampant illegal levies and weak investment management, coupled with high leakage of investment caused by high cost economy had posed a stumbling block to investment inflows.
Publicly-listed tyre maker PT Gajah Tunggal Tbk has set aside US$170 million as capital expenditure to expand its business until 2010.
To increase the capacity of producing radial tyres, vehicle tyres and vehicle internal tyres, about US$170 million in investment is needed, Gajah Tunggal director Catharina Widjaja said in a public presentation here Wednesday.
She said the company needed US$100 million in funds to raise the capacity of producing radial tyres to 50,000 units from 30,000 units per day.
The capital expenditure originated from proceeds from the issuance of bonds worth US$325 million in 2005, she said.
Part of the fund has been used for business expansion and the remaining US$120 million has been used to repay debts, she said.
The company's total debts now reached US$487 million, she said.
Gajah Tunggal in the first half of 2007 posted a net profit of Rp73 billion compared to Rp125 billion in the previous semester.
The government has to earmark US$556 million in counterpart fund for project loans worth US$2.624 billion in the draft 2008 state budget, a government official said here over the weekend.
The project loans in the draft 2008 state budget were drawn up based on the amount of loan need for a multi-year project funding which will be carried out in 2008, Director for Funding Monitoring and Evaluation of the National Development Planning Board Bappenas, Benny Setiawan, said.
He said that the amount was proposed by the Bappenas and was approved by the government, in this case the Ministry of Finance as the competent institution.
Setiawan said that the amount of the project loans covered 176 projects, most of which were to be financed by Japan Bank for Reconstruction JBIC, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank ADB.
He said that the Bappenas had proposed a project loan of US$3.208 billion with a counterpart fund amounting to US$679.9 million.
But after a fiscal calculation is made, only US$2.64 billion project loans were approved.
Thus, the counterpart fund also decreased to US$556.09 million, he said.
Based on the previous proposal, the JBIC would provide the biggest amount at US$775.1 million for 37 projects, followed by the world bank US$708.3 million for 37 projects, the ADB US$608 million for 40 projects, other international donor institutions such as the Islamic Development Bank IDB and the International Fund for Agricultural Development IFAD US$132.2 million for 17 projects.
Donor countries such as Australia, the Netherlands, China, Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Germany, South Korea, Spain and Norway would also provide US$405.7 million for 35 projects, besides that, an amount of US$579.1 would be obtained from export facilities for projects in the defense and security sector
Indonesia's monthly inflation rate rose 0.75 percent in August, fueled by an increase in the price indice in the education, recreation and sports sectors and in the prices of foodstuffs, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said. 
August's inflation brought the calendar inflation January-August rate to 3.58 percent and the year-on-year inflation August 2006-August 2007 rate to 6.51 percent, BPS Chairman Rusman Heriawan said here Monday.
The on-year inflation rate stood at 3.58 percent in August.
Since the government has set the inflation target of 6.0 percent for this year we still have a reserve of 2.4 percent.
This means that on-month inflation must average 0.60 percent in the four months ahead. 
Over the period there will be inflation which may be lower or higher than expected.
What is important is that the government can ensure consumers of an adequate supply of goods, he said.
He said the government-set inflation target of 6.0 percent for 2007 was somewhat risky as the monthly inflation figures in July and August 2007 were fairly higher than in the same period last year.
Inflation rose on month to 0.72 percent and 0.75 percent respectively in July and August 2007 from 0.45 percent and 0.33 percent in the same period last year.
The BPS noted that spending on education, recreation and sports in August rose 3.18 percent, foodstuffs 0.79 percent gas and fuel 0.77 percent from a month earlier.
The kerosene price rose 9.7 percent, contributing 0.16 percent to inflation.
Kerosene belongs to the group of administered prices besides premium gasoline and diesel oil.
So far, Pertamina gasoline stations are the only premium gasoline and diesel oil retailers, he said.
The keronese price rose due in part to state oil and gas company Pertamina's decision to reduce supplies in line with the government's kerosene-to-gas conversion program, he said, since August 2006, the price of cooking oil had increased 42 percent, he said.
The price of cooking oil in August increased 4.3 percent from July, adding another 0.07 percent to the inflation figure, he said.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food prices and administered fuel prices, was recorded at a monthly 0.69 percent and an on-year 5.66 percent.
Indonesia saw a surplus of US$3.55 billion in its foreign trade in August with exports rising to US$9.81 billion and imports standing at US$6.26 billion.
Cumulatively, the country's trade surplus in the first seven months of 2007 reached US$23.64 billion, Central Bureau of Statistics BPS Chief Rusman Heriawan said on Monday, in the January-July 2007 period, Indonesia's exports reached US$63.53 billion and its imports stood at US$39.89 billion, he said.
He also said Indonesia suffered a deficit in its trade with China over the past few months.
Cumulatively, China was listed as the biggest supplier of non-oil/non-gas commodities to Indonesia, reaching US$4.35 billion, Our exports to China were only recorded at US$3.70 billion so we suffered a deficit, he said.
He said the surplus came mostly from Indonesia's trade with Japan, Indonesia's exports to Japan last month reached US$7.994 billion, while its imports from the East Asian nation stood at US$3.47 billion.
Indonesian chocolate ingredients maker PT Davomas Abadi through its subsidiary, International Finance Company Pte Ltd., has issued more guaranteed senior secured notes worth US$88 million.
The notes follow the US$150 million notes issued at coupon of 11 percent and due in 2011, Davomas Abadi President Director Anthonius Azer Unawekla said in a report to the Jakarta Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
He said the additional notes would not be offered to investors considered public bidders.
Local rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia Pefindo has assigned an idBBB rating to Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional BTPN with stable outlook.
The rating showed the bank's strong profitability, good capitalization and reliable assets, Pefindo analyst Hendro Utomo said in a statement on Friday.
However, the rating was weakened by the high risk of funding concentration, tight liquidity indicators and limited growth of its core business, he said.
Established in 1958 under the name of Bank Pegawai Pensiunan Military BAPEMIL, the bank was mainly engaged in receiving savings from and channeling credits to retired servicemen.
In 1986, the bank changed its name to Bank Tabungan Pensiun Nasional BTPN and became a commercial bank in 1993.
As of March 31, 2007, the bank was 28.39 percent owned by PT Pengelola Aset PPA, 22.61 percent by PT Recapital Advisors, 20 percent by Fuad Hasan Masyhur, 19 percent by PT Danatama Makmur and 10 percent by PT Bakrie Capital Indonesia.
The government is optimistic its full-year inflation rate target for 2007 of 6.3 percent will be achieved after concluding it has succeeded in securing distribution of basic necessaries, a minister said.
I am optimistic inflation will reach the target set in the 2007 state budget, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Boediono said here Friday.
He said the government was making every effort to ensure the smooth distribution of basic necessaries ahead of the Lebaran post-fasting month festivities to keep inflation under control.
Inflation is the balance between the flows of money and goods.
We will secure the flow of goods particularly basic commodities in the months ahead.
It seems that we will be able to secure the flow of goods, he said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Bank Indonesia Governor Hartadi said the inflation rate was projected to fall this month. 
The results of various surveys show signs of easing inflation in September compared to August.
The August inflation figure was exceptional, It was beyond what all parties had forecast, including Bank Indonesia.
Judging by the drop in the prices of several goods this week the inflation rate will fall this month, he said.
But the prices of some goods in the first week of September fell, I don't know their prices in the ensuing weeks as the fasting month of Ramadhan started just two days ago.
We saw the prices of rice fell on the average, he said.
The Central Bureau of Statistics BPS forecast the inflation rate in September would be below 1 percent.
I don't know this month's inflation because we still have two weeks away.
Bank Indonesia BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said there will be room for the central bank's key rate to go down if the US Federal Reserve cuts its rate at its meeting on Tuesday. 
If the Fed Fund rate drops by 25-50 basis points tomorrow, we will certainly have room to lower the key rate.
But we must also take into account domestic conditions, he said here Monday. 
In addition, he said, Bank Indonesia would also consider international financial conditions to decide whether or not to cut the key rate, locally known as BI Rate.
On Sept 6, the central bank decided to keep the key rate at 8.25 percent for the third month in a row while still carefully considering the impact of the subprime mortgage turmoil despite the country's improving macro economic conditions and the rupiah's stable exchange rate.
The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC is set to convene a meeting on Tuesday to decide its interest rate policy and US economic projections.
Some analysts believe the Fed will lower its interest rate at the meeting as part of monetary policies to help resolve the subprime mortgage turmoil in the US.
The much-anticipated drop in the Fed Fund rate is expected to encourage banks to lower their already high lending rates. 
To ease the impact of the subprime mortgage crisis, the Fed had cut its dicount rate to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent previously to strengthen the banking industry's liquidity. 
The World Bank has suggested that the Indonesian government and the House of Representatives DPR amend the newly-enacted law on limited liability companies, particularly regarding clauses on minimum capital requirements MCR.
I think the Doing Business Report published by IFC International Finance Corporation and the World Bank will explain what the government can do to increase the ease of doing business in Indonesia.
And one of the indicators is minimum capital requirements.
Many other countries in this region have zero minimum capital requirements.
So, the question is that must Indonesia increase minimum capital requirements for the establishment of companies? Hans Shrader, IFC advisory services general manager, said here Wednesday.
The IFC is the World Bank's private investment arm.
It was difficult to revise the implementation regulation of Law No.40/2007 on limited liability companies given the requirement for a minimum core capital of Rp50 million stipulated in the law, he said.  
I think amending the minimum capital requirement from the current position to zero level is the step that must be taken, he said. 
Based on the Doing Business 2008 Report published by the IFC, Indonesia improved its 'easiness of doing business' index worldwide.
In the report, Indonesia ranks 123 out of the 178 countries surveyed.
World Bank country director for Indonesia Joachim von Amsberg said the bank would no longer give concessional loans to Indonesia because it had become a middle-income country.
Indonesia has undergone a change in terms of the loans it receives from the World Bank, namely from International Development Assistance IDA schemed loans such as subsidies and grants to IBRD schemed loans.
This reflects the country's success in managing its economy.
Indonesia is now considered to be a mature middle-income country, he said.
He said, however, seeking World Bank loans was still more advantageous than issuing international bonds. 
There are a lot of advantages Indonesia can enjoy by seeking loans from the bank.
We will always make the loans more favorable for Indonesia.
The interest of our products is 50 basis points above Libor which always fluctuates but is still lower than market interests.
If Indonesia seeks loans in the international market their interest is between 100 and 200 basis points above Libor.
The World Bank also offers loans with longer grace periods, he said.
He said the World Bank is currently trying to make its products more attractive for its members including trying to lower their interest from the present level.
Indonesia's outstanding debts to the bank from 1967 to 2006 reached US$7.424 billion under the IBRD scheme and US$1.323 billion under the IDA scheme.
Bank Syariah Mandiri BSM expects its net profit this year to reach Rp113 billion revising its earlier target of only Rp75 billion.
Until August this year its net profit has reached Rp78 billion while there are still five months left to meet the target, its president director, Yuslam Fauzi, said here on Wednesday.
He said the target would be met with support from distribution of financing that was expected to reach Rp10.5 trillion by the end of this year.
The financing has already reached Rp9.2 trillion, he said.
He said the financing target was supported by non-corporate financing namely financing below Rp 10 billion as well as corporate financing which was above Rp10 billion.
He said the ratio between non-corporate and corporate financing was fifty-fifty.
He declined to tell further about the syndication saying I will tell you further about it later .
He said he hoped by the end of this year there would be additional capital incoming from shareholders reaching up to rp100 billion, it is hoped the addition will increase the capital adequacy ratio and strengthen distribution of financing to reach up to Rp1 trillion, he said.
The BSM, according to him, will maintain the CAR at 12 percent while its present ratio is 14.1 percent.
With the CAR in its present position, there is still room for expansion which will be wider following the Rp100 billion addition.
The addition of the paid-up capital, he said, would strengthen the BSM's capital currently reaching Rp775 billion in core capital and Rp1.049 trillion in total capital.
Yuslam said he was now considering syndication with three other shariah banks to finance projects worth more than Rp1 trillion.
BSM under the syndication will take a quarter of the financing, he said.
Bank BCA is preparing Rp 15.82 trillion in cash on the occasion of this year's post-fasting celebrations, to be distributed to the bank's ATM machines.
Rp 9.5 trillion will be made available to Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi, and the rest for other regions, vice president director of BCA Jahja Setiaatmadja said in Jakarta on Wednesday.
He said that the bank's ATM facilities will remain open even during holidays, but the bank's branch offices will be closed from October 12 through 14.
In the meantime, Bank BNI is preparing Rp 3.3. trillion in cash for a week starting from the Idul Fitria in anticipation of increased cash needs of the public.
For a month we are preparing Rp9,7 trillion in cash, Head of BNI's operational division Hemawati said.
State Minister for National Development Planning/Head of the National Development Planning Agency Paskah Suzeta said the government still hoped the World Bank would continue providing Indonesia with concessional loans under the International Development Association scheme, although Indonesia had managed to become a middle-income country. 
Paskah said in Jakarta on Wednesday that Indonesia was still in need of concessional loans to cover its 2007 budget deficit which had reached 1.54 percent of the country's GDP, or Rp58.285 trillion, besides issuing state bonds.
Paskah also hoped the World Bank would even increase the concessional loans. 
He also said that Indonesia will also try to secure low-interest loans from the Asian Development Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.
In the meantime, World Bank Country Director for Indonesia Joachim von Amsberg said the bank had stopped providing concessional loans to Indonesia since the country had managed to develop into a middle-income country.
Indonesia, which has been receiving concessional loans from IDA International Development Association in the form of subsidies and grants, now received loans as a medium-income country from the IBRD International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
This is a reflection of Indonesia's success in the management of its economy.
Indonesia is now regarded as a mature middle-income country, Joachim said in Jakarta Wednesday.
Nevertheless, he added, a World Bank loan is more favorable to Indonesia compared to the issuance of international bonds.
Indonesia would derive many advantages from World Bank loans, and we are also trying to make them increasingly advantageous to Indonesia.
The interest rate of our products is 50 basis points above the fluctuating LIBOR, but still lower than market interest rates.
If Indonesia goes to the international market, it will find that interest rates ranged from 100 to 200 basis points above LIBOR.
The World Bank also offers longer borrowing and grace periods, Joachim said.
He said the World Bank is currently trying to make its products increasingly interesting to its members, including the possibility of the lowering of its loan interest rate.
Indonesia's outstanding World Bank loans under the IBRD scheme in the 1967-2006 period had reached 7.424 billion US dollars, and under the IDA scheme 1.323 billion US dollars.
Germany has converted an Indonesian debt of Euro 50 million into a health program fund dubbed Debt2Health Program to fight three deadly diseases, a report said.
Indonesian Ambassador to Germany Makmur Widodo, German Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul and Global Fund Executive Director Michel Kazatchkine signed the debt swap in Berlin on September 26 in conjunction with the opening of Global Fund donors' conference, the Global Fund said in a statement made available here Thursday.
The debt conversion required Indonesia to invest half of the debt value in various national health projects to combat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria through the Debt2Health Program.
The program would strengthen Indonesia's health system as well as allow Germany to fulfill its commitment to fighting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, Minister Wieczorek-Zeul was quoted as saying.
Publicly-listed oil drilling company PT ATPK Resources will manage old oil wells in Cepu district in Central Java through its subsidiary, PT ATPK Energy Resources, and a local firm, PT Anugrah Global Esa, a spokesperson said.
The location of the old wells is near ExxonMobil's oil field in Bendoharjo village, Gabus sub district, Central Java, ATPK Resources' Corporate Secretary Andreas Andy told the Jakarta Stock Exchange JSX here Friday.
The project to re-operate the old wells in Gabus sub district in Cepu district would eventually be developed into a joint operation program between PT ATPK Resources and state oil and gas firm PT Pertamina.
After PT ATPK had obtained the joint operation permit, PT ATPK Energy Resources would conduct exploration deep down in the old oil wells.
Andreas said it was hoped the old wells would initially produce 50 barrels per day but the output would later be gradually increased to 2,000 barrels per day. 
ATPK would get 70 percent of the profit and PT Anugrah Global Esa 30 percent, Andreas said.
Indonesia's balance of payments in the second quarter of 2007 recorded a surplus of US$3.6 billion compared to US$3.4 billion in the same period last year, Bank Indonesia said.
Current accounts and capital and financial accounts contributed to the surplus, the central bank said in a press statement issued on Friday.
In the second quarter of 2007 current accounts enjoyed a surplus of about US$2.6 billion against US$1.7 billion in the same period last year, while capital and financial accounts recorded a surplus of US$2.1 billion against US$25 million, it said.
The central bank projected the balance of payments in 2007 to see a surplus of an estimated US$11.5 billion with current accounts expected to record a surplus of US$10.8 billion or 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product. Last year, current accounts recorded a surplus of US$9.9 billion.
The promising prospects for current accounts were particularly fueled by the strong growth of the country's non-oil/non-gas exports thanks to the improving global economy and rising prices of export commodities, it said.
Meanwhile, capital and financial accounts in 2007 were expected to record a surplus of US$2.6 billion, about the same as last year, it said.
The surplus in capital and financial accounts reached a record high of US$4.4 billion in the first half of 2007 but the figure was expected to fall in the second semester due to a decline in portfolio investment in the aftermath of the subprime mortage turmoil in the US.
Given the surplus in the country's balance of payments, foreign exchange reserves were expected to increase to US$54.4 billion at the end of 2007 from US$42.6 billion a year earlier.
Among the main components of the current accounts that enjoyed a surplus in the second quarter of 2007 were the balance of non-oil/non-gas trade, the balance of gas trade, and the balance of current transfers.
The balance of non-oil/non-gas trade in the second quarter of 2007 saw a surplus of US$7 billion compared to US$5.7 billion a year earlier.
The Indonesian central bank's decision to keep its key rate at 8.25 percent for the third month in a row is expected to strengthen the rupiah, a banker said.
The stable BI rate has led to a very large spread between the rupiah and dollar interest rates, reaching about 3.50 percent 8.25-4.75 percent, Kostaman Thayib, banking retail director of privately-run Bank Mega, said on Tuesday.
The very large spread had prompted foreign investors to invest in the domestic financial market such as Indonesian retail bonds ORI, he said.
They were optimistic about the prospects for the Indonesian economy given the government's active role in spurring the infrastructure sector's growth and the banking industry's active part in channeling credits, he said. 
Market players who still held the rupiah were worried about buying the dollar due to imminent economic recession in the US, he said.
Even the US Federal Reserve itself would further lower its interest rate to boost the economy, defying inflationary pressure, he said. 
The BI Rate was kept unchanged as the inflation rate in October was expected to be higher than in the previous month, he said.
After all, the central bank still had the chance to lower the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 8 percent in November if the inflation rate that month fell, he said.
November's inflation rate was expected to fall due to a drop in public spending after the posting-fasting month Lebaran festivities, he said.
Publicly-listed pharmaceutical company PT Kalbe Farma Tbk KLBF invested another US$1 million in its Singapore-based subsidiary, Kalbe International Pte. Ltd. KI, on October 4.
The investment brings KLBF's paid-up capital in KI to US$2,000,001, KLBF Corporate Secretary Justian Sumardi said in a statement to the Jakarta Stock Exchange here on Tuesday.
Established on June 11, 2007, KI which is engaged in medicine trade is fully owned by KLBF.
PT Indah Kiat Pulp & Paper Tbk is planning to import pulp from Finland and New Zealand following a polemic between the Indonesian police and the Forestry Ministry over illegal logging.
We predict our pulp stocks will be enough until late October.
Therefore, we will import pulp from Finland and New Zealand, the company's vice chief commissioner, G Sulistiyanto, said on Wednesday.
He said the company did not use illegal wood to produce pulp.
The natural wood we use to produce pulp only accounts for 20 percent of the total needs, and the rest originates from timber estate .
Because of pulp difficulties, the company had laid off hundreds of its workers, he said.
PT Indah Kiat's pulp need this year is estimated at 4.6 million tons, he said.
Director General of Customs and Excise Anwar Suprijadi has expressed optimism that the country will achieve the import duty receipts target of Rp13 trillion and the excise receipt target of Rp42 trillion for 2007.
Excise receipts until early October reached 80 percent of the target, surpassing our projected 75 percent.
This is better than what we achieved until the same period last yaer, he said here Wednesday.
The higher-than-expected excise revenue were attributable to at least four factors, namely good law enforcement, an increase in domestic production, better inspection of goods, and employees' integrity, he said.
As an institution functioning as trade facilitator, community protector and law enforcer, the Directorate General of Customs and Excise has a sustainable commitment to make every effort to make internal improvements, he said.
The government has finally agreed to restructurize non-performing loans amounting to Rp17.9 trillion of 1,470,692 micro, small and medium enterprises UMKM in four state banks, Cooperatives and UMKM Minister Suryadharma Ali said here Tuesday.

Publicly-listed oil and gas drilling company PT Energi Mega Persada ENRG has already stopped a drilling operation in Banjarpanji-1 BJP-1 and BJP-2 oil fields in Porong area in Sidoardjo district, East Java, a statement said.
ENRG terminated the drilling operation at 3,594 feet and 1,170 feet in BJP-1 and BJP-2 fields respectively, ENRG director Faiz Shahab said in the weekly report which was conveyed to the Jakarta Stock Exchange here Monday.
Drilling equipment in BJP-1 field has already dispersed on January 23 and BJP-2 on Jan 26.
Drilling activity in BJP-1 and BJP-2 began in the second week and the third week of September 2006 respectively, the statement said.
The drilling operation was done to stop hot mudflow from PT Lapindo Brantas exploration location in Renokenongo village in Porong area, Sidoarjo, East Java Province, the incessant hot mud came for the first time on May 29, 2006.
The disaster has affected economic activities in East Java as many residential areas, paddy fields, plantations, schools, offices and industrial zones in three subdistricts have been inundated by the mudflow for almost one year.
The government is to set up an energy food company called PT Pangan Energi Nusantara as a joint venture among nine state-owned companies operating in the agricultural sector in an effort to increase domestic rice production and raise farmers'income, a minister said. 
We are seriously studying the possibility of setting up PT Pangan Energi Nusantara as a subsidiary of nine state-owned companies.
The establishment of the company is intended to help the government's program to raise farmers' income and increase domestic rice production by combining organizational and technological approaches, State Minister for State Enterprises Sugiharto said here Monday.
According to the minister, the planned company would not be a substitute for or a rival to the State Logistics Agency Bulog as Bulog would provide assistance for PT Pangan Energi Nusantara's operations.
Besides Bulog, eight other state companies were expected to join the consortium sponsoring the planned company, namely PT Sang Hyang Sri dealing with food, PT Pupuk Sriwijaya fertilizer, PT Pupuk Kaltim fertilizer, PT Pupuk Kujang fertilizer, PT Petrokimia Gresik petrochemicals, PT Pertani food, Perum Jasa Tirta I water and Perum Jasa Tirta II water.
We are completing the plan, We have asked the nine state companies to incorporate the plan in their respective 2007 work plans and company budgets, the minister said.
He said with the nine state companies joining the consortium, the relevant parties could be coordinated to enable farmers to increase rice production. 
In every 10,000 hectares, a company belonging to farmers could likely be built so that there is organizational and technological certainty.
With hybrid technology, average production could be increased from four tons per hectare to 10 tons per hectare, he said.      
The plan was expected to be materialized in stages and the farmers would get added value not only from dried unhulled rice but also from other derivative products and greater volume of rice.  
Commercially, the planned project is very feasible as rice production will increase so that it can help meet the government's target of producing two million more tons of rice or about 3.5 million tons of dried unhulled rice between 2007 and 2008, the minister said.    
He said Bulog would be involved in the establishment of the company as it had warehouses and was able to become a standby buyer besides having logistics management to improve prices.  
With the expected additional two million tons of rice, hopefully, we can be self-sufficient in rice if harvests do not fail, he said.
The exchange rate of the rupiah at the Jakarta Inter-Bank Spot Market on Monday afternoon strengthened by 12 points to Rp9.068/Rp9,070 against the US dollar compared to Rp9,80/Rp9,085 at the closing session late last week as the release of the green back still continued.
Speculations of the release of the US dollars still continue due to the strengthening of gold prices on the global market, foreign exchange analyst of publicly listed PT Himpunan Saudara, Yusuf, said here Monday.
According to Yusuf, the US dollar also suffered by worries about the superpower's nuclear program prompting foreign agents to release the US currency.
The worries had even prompted some western countries to hold a meeting to discuss Iran's nuclear program, he said.    
Local agents are still speculating and bought the rupiah causing the Indonesian currency to appreciate, he added.
The strengthening of the rupiah was supported by the regional market due to the weakening the US dollar against the Japanese yen and the euro, so that the Indonesian currency appreciated by more than 10 points against the green back, he said.
If the support continues and caused the rupiah exchange rate to exceed Rp9,050 against the US dollar, Bank Indonesia would likely enter the market to stop a further increase, he said.        
He pointed out that in the long run, the rupiah exchange rate was predicted to stay between Rp9,000 and Rp9,100 against the US dollar as it would not give a positive impact on exporters and importers, he said.     
Bank Indonesia is now playing an important role in the money market as it has strong reserves amounting to US$43 billion.
The Directorate General of Customs managed to uncover the smuggling of textile in 16 containers from China in Bandung that had caused the state to suffer a loss of Rp4 billion.
Based on an audit conducted by the Bandung Customs Office, it was known that PT PRG which received the facility in the bonded zone, have allegedly misused the facility, Head of the Bandung Customs Office Jody Kusmendro told the press here on Thursday.
He added that the company used the duty-free import facility to import textile of other commodities and later gave it to the real owner. However, the textile was never returned to PT PRG but sold by the real owner.
He added that the office had blocked the customs activity of PT PEG and seized the rest of the containers, namely 15 containers in West Java and one in Tanjung Priok, Jakarta.
He said the real owner of the containers had to pay an official import duty of Rp250 million for each container. 
He said the act was committed since October last year and the office used the old Customs Law while the new law came into effect ony in November last year.
Director General of Customs Anwar Suprijadi, meanwhile said the office was now conducting an inspection of the facility of the bonded zone which had been granted to 762 importers.
Head of the Indonesian Textile Assosciation API Benny Sutrisno predited that the smuggled textile might be worth Rp6.05 billion.
He added that out of the US$1.6 billion textile imported in 2006, only US$300 million was legal.
On the occasion, Benny also called on the government to raise the fine imposed on the smugglers and to review the import facility granted to some importers.
Indonesia's private oil and gas firm PT Energi Mega Persada ENRG has signed a binding final agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. Ltd Japex, an official said.
The move was made by issuing share of ENRG's subsidiary namely Energi Mega Pratama Inc EMPI last March 6, ENRG director Faiz Shahab told the Jakarta Stock Exchange BEJ here Friday.
The issuance of the EMPI shares is a follow-up to Head of Agreement HoA which was signed last week, he said.
The binding final agreement specifies that Mitsubishi and Japex will control 50 percent working contract in Kangean PSC block cumulatively and finance parts of major projects at Kangean block.
The transaction will generate fund totaling US$360 million in the form of the issuance of EMPI new shares.
The transaction which involves the taking over of EMPI new shares issued by Mitsubishi and Japex will reduce ENRG ownership in EMPI to 50 percent, he said.
The transaction, Faiz said is a material one which must be approved by the majority of ENGR shareholders who will hold a shareholders' meeting next April.
The transaction reflects ENRG strategy which is focusing on vital growth, gas commercialization and operational superiority which can give a special value to shareholders, he said.
Late February Kangean PSC produced 39 MMscfd gas, 250 barrels of condensate and 3800 barrels of oil per day.

Thailand's new finance minister said Friday he would keep controversial currency rules, dashing market speculation that the government would soon lift the measures aimed at curbing the Thai baht's rise.
The capital rules, imposed by the army-backed government in December, required 30 percent of all incoming investment to be held by financial institutions for up to one year, sparking a massive stock sell-off.
Many exemptions have since been made to the controls but the general policy remains at least in theory.
The appointment of Chalongphob Sussangkarn as the new finance minister earlier this week raised hopes that the government would end the stringent rules as the former World Bank economist had previously come out against them.
But Chalongphob said the capital rules were needed to control the Thai unit, which has risen nearly 12 percent against the dollar over the past year.
Regarding the 30-percent reserve rules, I personally think that Thailand still needs measures to manage capital flows in and out of the country, he told reporters.
At the moment, appropriate measures to replace the capital rules have not been found and any policy changes must be made appropriately and gradually to minimise impacts on the stock market, he said.
When the government introduced the capital measures in December, investors panicked, causing the biggest one-day drop in the Thai stock market with losses worth a staggering 23 billion dollars.
The central bank chief, Tarisa Watanagase, said in a newspaper interview Thursday that she was waiting for the right time to completely lift the currency controls.
Bank Indonsia BI Deputy Governor Aslim Tadjuddin said here on Friday the exchange rate of the country's currency, the rupiah, would tend to strengthen in the days ahead because the country's macro-economic fundamentals were stable.
The rupiah will tend to strengthen in the future and BI will continue to maintain the rate at between Rp8,000 and Rp9,400 against the US dollar, he said.
He said BI would maintain the present rate so that it would not fluctuate too widely because the rate was already good enough to be acceptable to the business community, especially exporters and importers.
The recent drop in the exchange rate of the Thai baht would not affect the rupiah because the depreciation is still within expected limits, he said.
Regarding the inflation rate, Aslim said it would still be the same as in February.
I think it will be the same as or at least not be below the figure in February because there was a recent hike in the rice price, he said.
He said the government had already taken all measures to limit the hike such as through rice imports and market operations so that the hike in the rice price this month would not affect inflation.
Hopefully, in March inflation will be lower and the target of six plus and minus one percent inflation will be met, he said.
He said the global crisis had already diminished and some stocks had returned to their normal position. 
There was indeed a reserve carry trade in Japanese yen but it is already over now, he said.
Regarding limitation of accumulation of banking funds in Bank Indonesia Certificates SBI Taslim said that it was not an important issue.
What is important is how to make the real sector move because if the sector moves banks would supply it with credits and automatically funds in the SBI will drop, he said.
On the target of growth, he said bank credits were needed to meet it.
What is important now is creating a conducive investment atmosphere and eradicate obstacles that hinder real sector development not limiting funds in SBI, he said.
The government is estimating that Indonesia's economic growth in 2008 will continue to be around 6.6 percent as many quarters have projected, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said. 
This is still an initial exercise.
We hope we can see the range of economic growth in 2008 after we see the realization of economic growth in 2007 which is projected at 6.3 percent, the minister said after attending a meeting at the presidential office here on Tuesday.
The minister said many circles doubted the government's target could be achieved but in her view it was better to see first how economic growth developed in the first semester of 2007.
We want a higher economic growth but we need to be realistic as well.
Therefore, we will set our temporary target at 6.6 percent for 2008, she said.
She said the government had set its 2007 economic growth target at 6.3 in but many circles such as eonomic observers, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, Citibank and Deusthe Bank had set it at a range of 5.5 to 6.5 percent.
My estimate is that economic growth in 2007 will be between 5.9 percent and 6 percent, she said.
National Development Planning Minister Paskah Suzetta said on Tuesday the deficit in the 2007 state budget would increase if the government had to provide bailout funds to solve the social problems of people who fall victim to the Lapindo mudflow disaster in Sidoarjo, East Java.
But if the DPR House of Representatives eventually agrees to ask the government to allocate state budget funds for the Lapindo case, we will do it, he said after a cabinet session at the presidential office here.
Paskah, who is also chief of the National Development Planning Agency Bappenas, said the government was still discussing the material losses caused by the Lapindo mudflow disaster with the House.
If the bailout was agreed upon by the House and the government, it would be included in the revised state budget, he said.
Let's wait for the results of the discussion.
Where budget allocation, be it bailout or else, is concerned, it must first be discussed through the mechanism for state budget revisions, he said. 
He said there was no budget allocation for the purpose in the 2007 state budget.
We will try to ensure that the deficit in the 2007 state budget will be less than 2 percent of gross domestic product, he said.

Publicly-listed cement maker PT Indocement Tunggal Perkasa Tbk announced on Thursday its net profit in 2006 fell by 19.86 percent to Rp592.80 billion from a year earlier.
The drop was mainly caused by a rise in its operating costs and miscellaneous expenses as net income rose to Rp6.325 trillion in 2006 from Rp5.592 trillion the year before, according to the company's consolidated financial statement. 
Gross profit went up to Rp2.148 trillion from Rp2.020 trillion, However, operational expenses rose to Rp1.080 trillion from Rp805.94 trillion, causing perational profit to fall to Rp1.068 trillion from Rp1.214 trillion
On the other hand, net miscellaneous expenses jumped to Rp215.16 billion from Rp154.19 billion due to a surge in interest expenses, causing net profit to fall, As a result, earning per share fell to Rp161.03 from Rp200.93.
Indonesian insurance company AAJI is collaborating with two international agencies, namely LOMA and LIMRA, to set up a professional insurance agency, a spokesperson said.
We want to have competent life insurance agents who have international disciplines, AAJI chairwoman Evelina Pietruschka said here Thursday.
LIMRA International is a member-owned organization, dedicated to meeting the marketing information needs of companies involved in marketing annuity, disability, health, life, mutual fund, and retirement savings products.

The rupiah's exchange rate against the US dollar on the Jakarta Inter-bank Spot Market improved to 9,100/9,105 on Thursday afternoon from 9,130/9,135 per dollar the day before, a gain by 30 points, an observer said.
Money market observer Farial Anwar said here Thursday the rupiah should have passed the psychological level of 9,100 per US dollar but the Indonesian unit had failed to do so as Bank Indonesia the central bank was reluctant to make the rupiah stay lower than 9,100 against the US currency.
He said the rupiah had strengthened due to different positive factors, both internal and external.
Internally, there was high demand for domestic bonds and the Indonesian Retail Obligation ORI while externally, the US dollar weakened against a number of major Asian currencies due to foreign agents' worries about the US economy, he said.
Farial said the rupiah could not stay under the level of 9,000 per US dollar during 2007 because exporters did not want the Indonesian currency to be in that position.
If the rupiah stood in that position, it would not support exports, he said. 
If the rupiah stood below 9,000 against the US dollar, the money to buy crude oil from foreign markets would decrease and the State Budget would not be valued at hundreds of trillions, he said.
We prefer the rupiah to stay below 9,000 per US dollar to reduce funds to buy crude oil, he said, adding that the rupiah was expected to stay at between 9,000 and 9,150 per US dollar.
Such a position was probable due to increasing worries about US economic growth after the US central bank the Fed said it was worried about the US inflation rate which was tending to increase, he said.
The US currency weakened against the euro after the Fed decided to maintain its overnight interest rate at 5.25 percent to 1.3412 compared to 1.3395 earlier or weakening by 0.15 percent while the US unit went up to 117.40 from 117.15.

In order to fuel its growth, the real sector will need not only low interest rates but also other incentives such as fiscal and tax policies, debureaucratization, law enforcement and elimination of smuggling and illegal transactions.
The real sector could be encouraged not only with Bank Indonesia BI's low interest rate but also with other incentives such as fiscal or tax policies, elimination of smuggling and illegal transactions, Economic observer Ryan Kiryanto said here on Monday.
He said that BI was expected to lower its rate BI rate by 25 percent basis points from nine percent to 8.75 percent as the inflation had shown a declining trend which in March was expected to reach 0.5 percent.
But it is not impossible that BI will maintain nine percent with a compensation that this week BI will continue to slacken banking rules in the field of credit provision, he said.
Ryan said in order to boost the growth of the real sector and to reduce the amount of banking funds invested with Bank Indonesia Certificates SBI, he would prefer if the BI rate was lowered by 25 basis points.
He said that the lowering of the BI rate had failed to drive the growth of the real sector because it was not followed by economic and fiscal policies.
So, BI, banks and the real sector should not be blamed.
The government should adopt breakthrough policies in order to boost the growth of the real sector, he added.
BI had previously said that the investment by banks of their funds in BI's monetary instrument, namely SBI, was something normal as banks were in surplus of liquidity, besides the constraints they faced in their intermediary roles.
BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said the idle funds invested with the SBI reflected that banks faced problems with exercising their intermediary roles.

Economic observer Ryan Kiryanto hailed the new regulation and hoped it could help develop the real sector especially small and medium businesses.
Domestic banks have lowered their interest on time deposits following the Deposit Insurance Agency LPS's decision this week to cut its insurance rate to 9 percent from 9.25 percent previously.
Banks have taken precautionary measures in lowering their interest on rupiah-and dollar-denominated time deposits to prevent customers from withdrawing their deposits, spokesman of PT Bank Central Asia BCA Dwi Narini said on Saturday.

With the decline in interest on time deposits, banks would again lower their lending rates despite Bank Indonesia the central bank's decision to keep its benchmark interest rate BI Rate unchanged at 9 percent this month, she said.
It was expected the drop in lending rates would boost demand for banking loans, she said.
The banking industry had so far not been serious about extending credits to the public so that they could not play their intermediary role as expected, she said.
She said debtors hoped lending rates would range from 11 percent to 12 percent by the end of this year.

The Supervisory Board of the Capital Market and Financial Insitutes Bapepam-LK has issued a policy to nurture securities companies as investment managers.
Bapepam-LK's chief Fuad Rahmany said in a press statement here on Saturday the policy was adopted to improve the condition of the mutual fund industry and its managers in the country and public confidence in them. 
The net value of assets in the mutual fund industry in the past two years had been fluctuating after reaching around Rp114 trillion in February 2005, by the end of 2005 it drastically dropped by 74.56 percent to only around Rp29.35 trillion, he said.
Fuad said the industry was now recovering and its value had risen by 107 percent to Rp59.58 trillion in March 2007.
Until March 2007, the number of effective mutual funds had reached 400 while investment managers comprised over 111 companies, he said.
He said 20 investment managers controlled 92.11 percent of the total net assests until March 2007, 10 of them controlling 70 percent of the total assets.
Meanwhile 91 investment managers or more than 80 percent of investment managers controlled only around 7.9 percent of the total net assets.
He said this reality had prompted an evaluation of the industry and the condition of investment managers already licensed by Bapepam-LK.
To create a conducive situation to recover public trust in the industry professional investment managers with strong commitment are needed, he said.
Therefore, Bapepam-LK had decided to evaluate the performance of all investment managers that had received a license and conduct capacity building for the managers and improve their prudence.
Fuad said to maximize the effort Bapepam-LK would not issue a new license for securities companies also acting as investment managers.
However, he said, Bapepam-LK would continue processing applications that had been received before the decision was made in line with regulations.

The rating reflected good telecommunication industry, stable market position amid increasing competition and majority shareholders' stronger profile, Pefindo analysts Salyadi Saputra and Hendro Utama said in a report to the Jakarta Stock Exchange here on Monday.
Yet the company's need for large amounts of funds to expand business and high exposure to foreign currency risks would slightly affect the rating, Pefindo said.
Since it started operatinng in October 1996, Excelcomindo has managed to maintain its position as Indonesia's third biggest cellular operator after Telkomsel and Indosat, it said.
In 2006, Excelcomindo was 59.63 percent owned by Indocel Holding Sdn Bhd, 16.81 percent by Khazanah Nasional Bhd, 15.97 percent by Radjawali Corpora, 7.38 percent by AIF and 0.21 percent by the public.

Bank Indonesia BI Deputy Governor Budi Rochadi said the national shipping industry had so far only received a relatively small amount of credits from banks, namely Rp7 trillion or just 0.8 percent of the overall amount of credits banks had issued. 
The amount of bank credits extended to the shipping industry is still small because the banks still consider the industry a risky one, Budi Rochadi said when opening a workshop on national shipping financing at the BI building here on Wednesday.
He said national shipping companies were having no problem with their income because their cargo transport services were contract-based. 
Budi said the amount of bank credits really needed by the national shipping industry was Rp27.6 trillion.
Where collateral is concerned, I don't think shipping companies will have problems in this matter because banks already have standing procedures, he said.
He said the central bank would serve as a bridge between banks and shipping companies so that the latter could get more financing while banks would feel more secure.
Budi also said up to now, almost 50 percent of domestic cargo shiiping was still controlled by foreign shipping firms while in the transportation of export and import goods, the share of national shipping companies was only about five percent.
He said until March 2007, the number of ships operated by national shipping companies had increased by only 18.14 percent to 7,137 units with a carrying capacity of seven million gross tons.
Based on the roadmap for the implementation of Presidential Instruction No. 5 / 2005, all foreign ships providing domestic cargo transportation services in Indonesia should be replaced with vessels flying the Indonesian flag.
He said of the 13 commodities which should be transported by ships flying the Indonesia flag by 2010, four were still being transported by foreign vessels, namely coal, oil, liquids and farm produce.
In the meantime, Oentoro Surya, chairman of the Indonesia National Shipowners Association, said national shipping companies were constantly suffering opportunity losses because foreign companies dominated domestic commodity transportation which reached a value of US$17 billion.

Clauses in Government Regulation No.20/1994 allow a foreign firm to control up to 95 percent of a domestic telecommunication company, he said after the launch of e-Indonesia Initiative Forum here Wednesday.
Lippo Group sold its stake in NTS to Maxis after it failed to develop telecommunication infrastructure although the cellular phone operator had obtained an operation license three years ago, he said.  
Maxis had said it would invest $500 million in the next one year to set up a telecommunication network as stipulated by the Indonesian government.
NTS has so far provided people in East Java with 12,000 cellular phone lines.
Bank International Indonesia Tbk BII's net profit in the first quarter this year dropped 34.6 percent to Rp115 billion from Rp176 billion in the same period last year, its president director, Henry Ho, said in a press statement received here on Wednesday.
The drop was the result of a decline in credit margin caused by intensive market competition since March 2006 and competition for third party funds and a shift in the public's saving pattern from saving accounts to deposits, he said.
Although competition is increasing, our business remains ensured especially after passing a difficult time in 2006.
Source of income growth, various important programs and initiatives that have been implemented have already yielded results and we hope there will be a significant improvement in performance until the end of this year, he said.

The credit growth mainly came from the small-and medium-business/commercial sector which grew 33 percent, he said.
The bank's credit composition now is 33 percent for consumer, 39 percent for small-and medium-business/commercial sector, and 28 percent for corporations.
Its Lending-to-Deposit Ratio rose from 57.49 percent last year to 58.44 percent in March this year.

The bank also recorded its net non-performing loan ratio rose from 2.13 percent in the first quarter in 2006 to 3.89 percent this year.

He said the bank would continue to expand its market by launching various initiatives and programs especially early this year to benefit from the improving economy.

The surplus was contributed by extraordinary revenues as the bank's own revenues fell and its expenditures rose, the bank said in its yearly financial statement.

Singapore revised upwards its 2007 economic growth forecast Monday, surprising economists, after a strong 6.1 percent first quarter expansion.
Financial services and construction led the gains in gross domestic product GDP during the first three months, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
The 6.1 percent year-on-year growth figure for GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in the country, was slightly ahead of the preliminary 6.0 percent estimate.
The Singapore economy started on a strong note, the trade ministry said, raising its 2007 GDP growth forecast to 5.0-7.0 percent from 4.5-6.5 percent.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, first quarter GDP growth eased slightly to 7.6 percent compared with 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, it said.
Growth in the first quarter was led by the financial services and construction sectors, the trade ministry said.
The manufacturing sector, however, continued to experience a moderation in growth .
The 9.7 percent first quarter expansion in construction was the strongest in nine years, it said.
Boom times have returned to the city-state's building industry after years of stagnation.
A rebound in property prices and the start of two multi-billion-dollar casino developments have also helped boost the sector.
Financial services expanded 13 percent in the first three months, particularly in the capital and money markets.
Manufacturing grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter, a drop from 7.7 percent in the previous quarter, pulled down by a 5.0 percent decline in biomedical production and a 0.7 percent fall in precision engineering.
Electronics grew 2.6 percent, recovering from a 4.1 percent decline in the fourth quarter last year, while transport engineering which includes offshore oil rigs expanded 23 percent, the ministry said.
Manufacturing accounts for one third of Singapore's GDP which was valued at 210 billion dollars 140 billion US last year.
Wun said the electronics sector, a key contributor to exports from Southeast Asia's most advanced economy, appears to be bottoming out .
We will take a look at adjustments in the context of all monetary instruments we have such as the BI rate, foreign exchange reserves and weekly auction. 
If need be, we will consider the GWM. 
We have many weapons so that we will adopt a good policy combination that will have a minimum negative impact and bring down the inflation rate, the central bank governor said.
Previously, BI had projected the inflation rate this year at 4 - 6 percent and at 3.5 - 5.5 percent in 2009. 
But until June, the year-on-year inflation rate has reached 11.03 percent.
Banks with a DPK of lower than Rp1 trillion are only required to meet the 5 percent GMW requirement.
Data at BI show that until December 2007 the amount of GWM was Rp158.45 trillion and up to March 2008 it was recorded at Rp125.71 trillion.
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs/Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the rate at which foreign direct investment FDI plans in the Batam Bintan Karimun BBK region were being implemented was not satisfactory and therefore much needed to be done in various sectors to increase the rate. 
Although we have already achieved good results, in my opinion, there are still a lot things which need to be improved.
It's proven that the realization of FDI in BBK has not yet met the target, Minister Sri Mulyani said after a meeting at her office, here on Tuesday evening.
She said the BBK region was earlier expected to attract foreign direct investments worth a total of around US$1 billion. 
Some factors which had made the region unable to meet the target might include human resource quality, manpower policy, infrastructure, taxation, and customs and excises, she said.
She called on concerned parties to hold regular meetings to deal with the problems.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said a state should provide a comprehensive financial report which, for example, included state budget, balance of payments, cash flow and other financial notes, not a report which looked like that of a merchandise shop.
Speaking to a national working meeting on accountancy and government financial report here on Wednesday, the vice president referred to his disappointment when he was newly installed as vice president and received from the finance minister a financial report which he described as looking like that of a merchandise shop.
I remember when five days after I was installed I told the finance minister that I wanted to see the state's financial strength but what I received was a something similar to the financial report of a merchandise shop, he said.
The vice president said at that time he also wanted to see state's money reserves and assets. 
But he was even upset to see the report where the values of the yen, dollar and euro currencies were counted in one place.
This is just the same as counting a herbal medicine plus an apple, plus a goat and the result is equal to buffaloes.
What a financial report! What happened with the finance ministry.
I threw it away.
It's a stupid thing for us not to know our financial strength, the vice president said.
Therefore, he said, he asked that the report be revised so that the state's financial strength could be known every day.
The vice president acknowledged that the state was facing difficulties from year to year in its financial report because the state budget continued to increase from Rp300 trillion in the past to Rp1,000 trillion nowadays.
On the occasion, the vice president also called on the people to also look at the achievements the state had reached, not merely at the saddening things.
He said that the poverty rate had been cut from 30 percent to 16 percent and unemployment from 16 percent to eight percent. 
The government has asked the House of Representatives DPR to approve an additional allocation of Rp2 trillion for its fiscal risk reserves in anticipation of an increase in the world crude price to US$150 per barrel in the second semester of 2008. 
In its First Semester Report and Projection for the Second Semester of 2008 submitted to the House's Budget Committee here on Wednesday, the government said it needed an additional Rp2 trillion for its fiscal risk reserves which would be used to cover a shortfall if the world crude price reached US$150 per barrel in the coming six months.
The oil price covered by fiscal risk reserves in the 2008 revised state budget was US$100 per barrel.
This figure has been far exceeded by the present world oil price. 
In the first semester of 2008, the oil price was US$109.4 per barrel.
The government also proposed an additional allocation of Rp3.4 trillion for its rice-for-the-poor program. 
The additional budget was proposed owing to the increase in the rice and other food prices.
In order to increase the capability of small- and medium-scale businesses, the government also requested Rp1 trillion in additional funds to underwrite people's business credits.
In the revised 2008 budget, the allocation for this purpose was Rp1.4 trillion.
As a result of the fuel oil price hikes in May 2008, the government also provided scholarships for students of low-income families with a budget of Rp200 billion.
In anticipation of contingency budget needs until the end of 2008, the government also proposed additional budget amounting to Rp1.2 trillion.
The budget allocation for budget need in the revised 2008 state budget has been spent so that the government was proposing additional contingency budget for the second semester of this year.
The government also asked for additional budget for the election supervisory body Bawaslu amounting to Rp900 billion.
The rupiah tended to stabilize on Thursday morning as investors were careful in entering the market causing the transactions value to fall from the day before, a money market observer said.
The investors' stand followed a recent fall in global crude prices to US$135 a barrel causing the dollar to strengthen in the global market, Edwin Sinaga said on Thursday.
The rupiah rose by two points to Rp9,130/9,140 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday morning compared to Rp9,132/9,145 per dollar the previous day.
Actually, the rupiah still had a wide chance to further strengthen but the recent drop in global crude prices had hindered its appreciation although oil prices rose by 40 dollar cents on Thursday morning to more than US$135 a barrel, he said. 
We are optimistic the rupiah will again strengthen to Rp9,100 per dollar because the drop in global crude prices is temporary in nature, he said.
The optimism was also based on the statement by Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI Governor Boediono that the country's economic growth was on the right track, paving the way for the attainment of the government-set economic growth rate target for this year.
He said the US mortgage turmoil which affected various European countries had had no significant impact on the Indonesian economy.
The rupiah's strengthening showed foreign investors' growing confidence in the Indonesian economy although the government's recent decision to raise fuel prices had a negative impact on various sectors, he said
Publicly-listed construction company PT Adhi Karya Tbk said on Thursday it has signed a Rp1.785 trillion contract with state oil and gas company PT Pertamina for the provision of 3-kg liquefied petroleum gas cylinders.

The government is selecting prospective dealers of its first-ever rupiah-denominated sharia bonds to be issued in August, a Finance Ministry official said.
We have already extended invitations to 11 prospective dealers, both local institutions and foreign investment banks, Director General of Debt Management at the Finance Ministry Rahmat Waluyanto said here on Friday.
But he stopped short of naming the 11 prospective dealers, adding five of them were foreign institutions.
Four of the 11 institutions have so far been primary dealers of state bonds, he said.
He said the government would soon appoint a law consultant in the issuance of the rupiah-denominated sharia bonds.
When the government issued its first-ever state bonds SUN in December 2002, it only appointed dealers. 
But now to issue state sharia bonds it will also appoint a law consultant to deal with various legal aspects related to sharia law, he said.
He said at least 10 domestic law consultants had applied for the post.
The government expects the law consultant and dealers will be appointed by July 29 at the latest.
To issue state sharia bonds, the House of Representatives DPR had given a seal of approval to the government to use state assets worth Rp18.3 trillion at the Finance Ministry as underlying assets, Rahmat said.
We have secured a permit from the DPR to use state assets in the form of land and buildings worth Rp18.3 trillion for the purpose, he said.
The rupiah fell below the psychological level of Rp9,150 per dollar on Tuesday morning as investors sold the local unit over worries about a global economic slowdown and soaring global crude prices, a foreign exchange analyst said.
The sluggish global economy and soaring global crude prices have caused the rupiah to weaken further, Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Sudara Tbk said on Tuesday. 
The rupiah traded at Rp9,160/9,170 per dollar on Tuesday morning against Rp9,148/9,159 per dollar the day before, down by 12 points.
Despite a persistent drop over the past few days the rupiah's current exchange rate against the US greenback was relatively stable now that the government expected the rupiah to trade at between Rp9,000 and Rp9,500 per dollar this year, he said.
The rupiah's weakening would be temporary and the Indonesian currency still had a chance to strengthen owing to positive market sentiments particularly an inflow of foreign capital after the government had issued global bonds, he said.
The stable conditions and higher rupiah interest rate would continue to attract an inflow of foreign capital, he said.
The government must be able to approach foreign investors to make long-term investment which would in the end reduce the country's unemployment rate and improve the people's purchasing power, he said.
In addition, the government must also be able to benefit from high economic growth in such Asian countries as China and India particularly after Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI had predicted the Indonesian economy would slow down in the third quarter of 2008, he said.
The Indonesian economy in the third quarter of 2008 was expected to grow in a range of 6.1-6.5 percent compared with 6.51 percent in the previous quarter, he said.
The government in the first semester of 2008 realized the payment of Rp41.4 trillion in interest on its foreign and domestic debt, or 45.7 percent of the ceiling of amount of Rp94.7 trillion, a finance ministry official said.
The payments were made before the total of the payable interest increased to Rp97 trillion, the ministry's director for settlements, accountancy and evaluation, Widjanarko, said here on Tuesday.
He said payments of interest on state debentures at home reached Rp30.7 trillion or about 46.6 percent of the interest ceiling of Rp65.8 trillion.
In the meantime, payments of interest on external debts totaled Rp10.7 trillion, including other costs such as management fees and commitment fees, he said.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said recently payments of interest on domestic and external debts this year were estimated to increase to Rp97 trillion from the previous ceiling of Rp94.7 trillion as a result of a change in inflation assumptions from 6.5 percent in January to 9 percent or even to 11 percent later this year.
According to the minister, at present interest rates were relatively high because domestic and global inflation rates were also showing an upward trend and this had affected the interest burden in the state budget.
The government has set an assumed economic growth rate of 6.2 percent in the 2009 draft state budget RAPBN and hoped it could maintain the momentum of domestic economic growth amidst the looming global economic slowdown.
Speaking to the press after a plenary cabinet session at the State Secretariat here on Tuesday, acting Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Sri Mulyani said the macro assumptions adopted in the draft stafe budget were based on domestic and global economic situations.
The assumptions which lay the basis for the drafting of the 2009 state budget are the inflation rate which is projected at 6.5 percent, interest on short-term promissory notes SBI for three-month deposits at 8.5 percent and the rupiah's stable exchange rate against the dollar at Rp9,100, she said in a press conference following the cabinet session.
She said the assumed oil price was set at US$140 a barrel, well above US$95-120 a barrel as recommended by the House of Representatives DPR.
Oil production was projected to reach 950,000 barrels per day, or the same as the ceiling recommended by the House with fuel oil consumption estimated at 38.9 million kiloliters, well above 35.5 million kiloliters quoted in the revised 2008 state budget, she said.
Gasoline consumption was estimated at 20.4 million kiloliters compared with 17 million kiloliters in the revised 2008 state budget, she said.
Diesel oil consumption is expected to increase to 12.6 million kiloliters from 11 million kiloliters in the revised 2008 state budget, she said.
However, kerosene consumption was projected to fall to 5.8 million kiloliters owing to the kerosene-to-gas conversion program expected to slash kerosense consumption by 4 million kiloliters, she said.
Based on the macro assumptions, the country's gross domestic product GDP next year is projected to increase to Rp5,295 trillion from Rp4,484 trillion in the revised 2008 state budget, she said.
Given the macro assumptions, the 2009 state budget would suffer a deficit of 1.5 percent of the GDP, or an equivalent of Rp78.8 trillion, she said.
The government has projected state receipts and expenditures next year at Rp1,158 trillion and Rp1,237 trillion respectively.
She said oil subsidy in 2009 was projected at Rp203.7 trillion and electricity subsidy at Rp84 trillion.
The rupiah rose five points to Rp9,130/9,135 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday morning from Rp9,135/9,142 the day before as investors bought the local unit.
The rupiah was expected strengthen further to Rp9,100 per dollar as foreign investors were still active in making transactions in the local market, money market observer Edwin Sinaga said on Thursday.
The rupiah's exchange rate remained unaffected by a report from the monetary authorities that the Indonesian economy would slow down in the third quarter of 2008, he said.
Foreign investors' activity in purchasing Bank Indonesia central bank/BI instruments such as state debentures SUN and short-term promissory notes SBI had caused the rupiah to appreciate although the rise was modest, he said.
Meanwhile, local investors were rather careful in buying the rupiah over worries about global economic turbulence, he said.
He said the rupiah would gradually trade below Rp9,100 per dollar although the level was already considered very stable.
We are optimistic the rupiah will strengthen to below the level thanks to strong positive sentiments, he said.
Moreover, the stable market and the inflow of Indonesian funds that had been deposited abroad would give a boost to the rupiah, he said.
It was only a matter of time for the rupiah to strengthen to below Rp9,100 per dollar, he said.
Domestic banks are planning to raise their interest rates on time deposits following Bank Indonesia central bank/BI's decision to increase its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.75 percent recently, a banker said.
The rise in interest rates on time deposits will possibly also prompt banks to increase their lending rates in order to adjust to the cost of funds, Kostaman Thayib, retail banking director of Bank Mega Tbk, said on Thursday.
The banks would be careful in raising the intrest rates on deposits so as not to disrupt their credit expansion, he said.
We will also first look at market conditions to decide whether it is time to raise the interest rates on deposits, he said.
Domestic banks were now required to live up to their intermediary function to help boost national economic growth, he said.
Although the Indonesian economy was expected to slow down in the third quarter of 2008, banks would continue to channel credits to the public, he said.
Farid Rahman, president director of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk, said the bank had yet to raise its interest rate on deposits.
We are still waiting for the large banks to raise their interest rates on deposits because they usually take the lead in the matter, he said.
Bank Saudara had so far set its interest rate on three-to-12-month rupiah and US dollar deposits at 8.75 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.
Meanwhile, state-owned Bank BRI said it planned to raise its interest rates on deposits early next week.
Bank Mandiri, the country's largest lender by assets, said it would raise its interest rate on deposits by 50 basis points.
Bank Mandiri's interest rate on one-to-12-month deposits in rupiah and US dolar was 5.5 percent and 2.75 percent respectively.
The Capital Market and Financial Institution Supervisory Board Bapepam-LK said Qatar Telecom QTel is only allowed to buy a maximum of 8.2 percent of state telecommunications operator Indosat's shares.
There is a sectoral regulation restricting share purchases so QTel cannot buy more than 8.2 percent of Indosat shares, Bapepam-LK Chairman Fuad Rahmany said here on Thursday.
He said QTel must not violate a regulation allowing a foreign company to hold not more than 49 percent of a national company's shares. 
We must safeguard the sectoral policy to protect the national interest, he said.
Under a presidential regulation on the negative investment list, a foreign company is only allowed to control a maximum of 49 percent of a national company's shares, he said.
QTel was currently already controlling 40.8 percent of Indosat shares so that it could only be allowed to increase its stake in the country's second largest telecommunication operator by at most 8.2 percent, he said.
We have no objection to the cooperation but it will never make QTel control more than 49 percent of Indosat shares, he said.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has offered to establish closer economic cooperation with Indonesia, an OECD spokesperson said.
We have proposed the development of special cooperative relations which we call 'enhanced engagement', OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said after a meeting with Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Sri Mulyani here Thursday.
The OECD had made the same offer to Brazil, China, India and South Africa, Gurria said, adding that along with Indonesia, the four countries would eventually be eligible for OECD membership.
Enhanced engagement was a more focused but at the same time comprehensive cooperation format for mutual benefit within the frame of efforts to improve world economic conditions, she said.
Meanwhile, the deputy for international cooperation to the coordinating minister for economic affairs, Mahendra Siregar, said the OECD had offered an economic cooperation plan suited to conditions in Indonesia.
The coordinating minister will evaluate the facilities to which Indonesia would have access in the proposed cooperation, and she will talk about it with other ministers, he said.
However, he said, Indonesia would focus on the economic cooperation offer rather than on the possibility of becoming a full member of OECD.
We will focus on economic cooperation, while the question of OECD membership which is dominated by advanced countries is not a priority, he added.
During her visit in Jakarta from July 23 to 27, Gurria is also scheduled to meet President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and a few other Indonesian state officials.
The rupiah rose five points to Rp9,130/9,133 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday evening from Rp9,135/9,142 the day before as investors bought the local unit, a foreign exchange analyst said.
Investors bought the rupiah following an International Monetary Fund IMF statement that the Indonesian economy will continue to grow by more than 6 percent, Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk said on Thursday.
Earlier, the monetary authorities said the Indonesian economy would slow down in the third quarter of 2008 as a result of the sluggish global economy.
The rupiah strengthened against the dollar in the morning but came under pressure in the afternoon as investors hesitated to continue buying the Indonesian currency, Nova said. 
The rupiah rose to Rp9,120 per dollar at 02.30 p.m. and fell to Rp9,136 per dollar at 02.45 p.m., he said.
The Indonesian currency again rose moments before the market closed so that it edged to Rp9,128 per dollar and eventually closed at Rp9,130 per dollar on Thursday evening, he said.
He said the rupiah's exchange rate against the dollar fluctuated as investors were still focusing their attention on global economic growth.
India and China are expected to enjoy high economic growth this year and Indonesia must benefit from their markets to boost its economy, he said.
The rupiah still had a good chance to strengthen to Rp9,100 per dollar, he said, adding, it is only a matter of time for the rupiah to reach this level. 
Judging by the stable market conditions and foreign investors' strong interest in investing in the domestic market, we are optimistic the rupiah will reach Rp9,100 per dollar, he said.
The government is proposing to the House of Representatives DPR a 200 percent in increase in maximum luxury good sales' tax PPnBM, or a drastic increase from the current PPnBM at 75 percent, according to a government's draft proposal on increase in value added tax PPN and PPnBM.
We have to study it first because we do not want that all luxury goods will eventually be liable to the maximum PPnBM, Chairperson of the Working Committee on the PPN and PPnBM Bill, Vera Febyanthy here over the weekend.
She said her side would ask for inputs from all stakeholders who were related to the proposal, particularly the automotive industries owing to the fact that so far the maximum PPnBM had been imposed on four wheel vehicles with machine capacity of over 3,000 CC.
I agree with it if the aim of the proposal is to increase the state tax receipts but there must be classifications of luxury goods first, she said.
This year the government has set a target of Rp129.7 trillion in tax receipts from PPN and PPnBM, which is an increase of 39.4 percent from Rp93.0 trillion a year earlier.
Up to the first semester of 2008, the realization of tax receipts from the PPN and PPnBM has reached Rp87.1 trillion or about 67 percent of the target.
The rupiah rose sharply to edge closer to Rp9,100 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Monday morning following a rush for the local unit.
The rupiah traded at Rp9,105/9,110 per dollar on Monday morning against Rp9,136/9,137 per dollar at the weekend, or an increase of 21 points.
As widely expected, the rupiah would hit the level thanks to strong positive market sentiments, money market observer Edwin Sinaga said on Monday.
We are optimistic the rupiah will strengthen below Rp9,100 per dollar due to the strong market support, he said.
He said the rupiah rose sharply after the monetary authorities believed the Indonesian economy would expand more than 6 percent this year despite a global economic slowdown.
Moreover, the government had been determined to benefit from China's and India's high economic growth, he said.
Coordinating Minister/Minister for Economic Affairs Sri Mulyani Indrawati said state-owned electricity company PLN was too slow in responding to the need for electricity and this was hampering economic growth in the regions.
I think PLN's response to the need for electricity in the regions is too slow. 
This is one of the aspects the government has to evaluate, the minister said. 
Speaking at a ceremony marking the signing of agreements between PLN and a number of banks on credit provisions, she cited as an example the difficulty to obtain electricity in Manado, North Sulawesi province.
I was to commission a new state financial institute building in Manado recently but it turned out the commissioning had to be postponed for six to nine months because the building has not yet been given electricity, she said.
She said she could imagine how more difficult it was to obtain electricity in towns smaller than Manado. 
Manado is the provincial capital of North Sulawesi. 
I just can imagine about the availability of electricity in smaller towns, the minister said.
She called on the PLN management to work more responsively but asked that it should remain consistent with the prudential principle.
Mulyani said the 10,000 MW thermal power project was underwritten by the government so that each time an agreement on its financing was signed, the finance minister must be present to witness it.
The rupiah fell 11 points to Rp9,287/9,290 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday following a rush on the US greenback, a foreign exchange analyst said.
Investors tended to sell out the rupiah after it had sharply strengthened at Rp9,276 per dollar, Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara said on Thursday.
Rully said the rupiah came under pressure throughout Thursday but it was still at a safe level of below Rp9,300 per dollar.
There was no need to worry about the price correction because the rupiah still had room to strengthen again, he said.
Investors were still waiting for the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise its interest rate which currently stood at 2 percent, he said.
If the interest rate was raised the difference between the rupiah and dollar interest rates would become larger, he said.
The Fed is expected to raise its interest rate by 25 basis points in July.
He said if the Fed's interest rate rose the rupiah would likely fall because investors would buy the dollar due to the high interest rate.
The rupiah which currently strengthened below Rp9,300 per dollar received a boost after the government offered state bonds overseas, he said.
The inflow of US dollars into the domestic market would cause the rupiah to move closer to Rp9,250 per dollar, he said.
The rupiah currently came under pressure due to a weakening of the Wall Street's index causing the regional stock exchange's index like Nikkei index to fall 2 percent, he said.
We are optimistic the insignificant market pressure will cause the rupiah to strengthen again on the ensuing days because of positive market sentiment thanks to the entry of foreign investors wishing to increase their investement in the domestic market, he said.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called for the further development of the government's micro credit programs in order to decrease the number of poor people which was expected to increase as a consequence of the oil and food price hikes.
The oil price surges had worsened the poverty problem and forced many countries to revise their economic projections and expectations, the President said in his speech opening the Asia Pacific Regional Micro Credit Summit here on Monday.
The price hikes had the potential to disturb political and social stability, and therefore the global community must jointly deal with poverty to protect their common future, the head of state said.
Micro Credit had proven able to help the poor who had no skills and capital for running businesses, according to Yudhoyono.
Micro credit recipients were known as good businessmen as data at the Indonesian central bank, Bank Indonesia, showed that problematic credits among them were only one percent, he said.
Economy focusing on small scale businesses was a long-term investment directing toward growth from below and important to reduce unemployment, he said.
Despite the existence of 50,000 micro finance institutions in Indonesia, there were still 40 million Indonesians who do not have access to micro credit services.
Most of them lived in remote areas with geographic and infrastructure restrictions, and lack of information on micro credit, according to him.
The Indonesian government is serious in developing remote areas and opening access to micro credits to local residents in the areas, he stated.
A number of banks had channeled micro credits and the government had also provided People's Entrepreneurship Credit KUR which is expected to reach Rp14-15 trillion this year.
The opening ceremony of the regional micro credit meeting, being held here from July 28 to 30, 2008, was attended among others by Nobel Laureate and president director of Bangladeshi Grameen Bank Muhammad Yunus, Bank Indonesia Governor Boediono, and Director of the Microcredit Summit Campaign Sam Daley-Harris.
After the summit's opening ceremony, President Yudhoyono received Muhammad Yunus.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said he expected the amount of People's Business Credits KURs channeled to the intended recipients to reach Rp15 trillion this year.
The amount of distributed KURs is expected to reach around Rp14 to Rp15 trillion or about US$1.6 billion this year, the President said at the opening of the Asia Pacific regional meeting on Micro Credits in Nusa Dua, Bali, on Monday.
According to the president, the KUR scheme was one of the government's efforts to increase the income of small- and medium-scale businessmen and lower the poverty rate.
The KUR program was launched in November 2007, and the amount of KUR funds extended to small- and medium-scale businessmen in the country to date had reached Rp8 trillion. A total of around 900,000 small- and medium-scale businessmen had received the assistance.
Yudhoyono expressed hope the meeting which was being attended by 1,000 participants from 40 countries would yield something concrete to help poor people.
We hope Indonesian delegates to the meeting will learn from the experience of other countries which are successfully managing their micro credits, Yudhoyono said.
Commenting on his meeting with Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, Yudhoyono said they discussed the implementation of micro credit schemes and concrete measures to reduce the poverty rate.
I have learned many from Muhammad Yunus's experience about methods to assist poor people in getting out of the bondage of poverty through micro businesses, the president said.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Yunus said at the forum that many countries had promised to start reducing poverty by implementing micro credit schemes.
All countries, especially in Asia, are doing their best to reduce their numbers of poor people, Muhammad Yunus said.
But he added the soaring fuel and food prices which had had a negative impact on the poverty rate had made it necessary to intensify the micro credit programs.
 The soaring fuel and food price hikes have made it difficult to reach the targets of the Millennium Development Goals in 2015. 
But believe me, micro credit programs can solve the problem, said the 2006 Nobel Peace laureate. 
Publicly-listed coal mining company PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam Tbk said on Monday its net profit in the first half of 2008 jumped 135 percent to Rp710.35 billion from Rp302.22 billion a year earlier.
The net profit hike was fueled by a significant rise in average coal prices at home and abroad, the company's investor relation officer, Nurtimah Tobing said.
The weighted average coal selling price in the export market in the first half of this year jumped 40 percent to US$63.63 a ton compared to US$45.44 a ton in the same period last year, she said.
Meanwhile, the weighted average coal selling price in the domestic market rose 30 percent to Rp435,926 a ton, she said.
The rise in selling price boosted the first-semester sales to grow 58 percent to Rp2.888 trillion and operating profit 163 percent to Rp959.459 billion from a year earlier, she said.
She said sale volume rose to 5.85 million tons in the first half this year from 5.07 million tons in the same period last year.
Nearly 63 percent of the company's coal output was marketed at home and the remaining 37 percent exported, she said.
The company had set itself the target of selling 13 million tons of coal this year, up 20 percent from the previous year.
The government plans to lower the assumed oil price in the draft 2009 state budget to US$130 a barrel from US$140 a barrel previously.
We see oil prices are indeed declining. 
We are still studying the drop. 
And we will look into the possibility of lowering it the assumed oil price, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs/Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said here on Monday.
At the recent cabinet plenary session discussing the notes of finance and the draft 2009 state budget, the government decided to propose an assumed oil price of US$140 a barrel to the House of Representatives DPR.
Global crude prices once hit another record high of US$145 a barrel but they fell to below US$125 a barrel in recent weeks.
But to avoid all possible risks we will always form fiscal risk reserves to anticipate the possibility of global crude prices soaring to another record high of US$160 a barrel, she said.
The minister said global crude prices fell significantly to up to US$120 a barrel in recent weeks.
Based on the global economic projections world crude prices would reach an equilibrium at around US$133 a barrel in 2009 and the price of Indonesian crude ICP would likely reach US$128-129 a barrel, she said.
So, we will likely set the assumed oil price at around US$130 a barrel but we remain conservative in that fiscal risk reserves will remain unchanged, she said.
Based on information and developments in the past 24 months, global crude prices were not likely to plunge or continue to fall, she said.
But even if the global crude prices increase they will not reach a level of up to US$200 a barrel as many people feared they could not long ago, she said.
Publicly-listed plantation company PT Astra Agro Lestari Tbk posted a net profit of Rp1.59 trillion in the first semester of 2008, up 134 percent from the same period last year.
Crude palm oil CPO, palm kernel oil KPO, rubber and cocoa sales in the first semester jumped 91.66 percent to Rp4.64 trillion compared with Rp2.39 trillion in the same period last year, according to the company's financial statement published on Monday.
The average CPO sales price in the first semester of 2008 rose 58.9 percent to Rp8,229 a kg while the average KPO sales price jumped 81.9 percent to Rp10,599 a kg.
Although the cost of goods sold in the first semester of 2008 was recorded at Rp2.11 trillion against Rp1.25 trillion a year earlier, gross profit rose to Rp2.54 trillion from Rp1.14 trillion previously.
Mobile phone operator PT Excelcomindo Pratama EXCCL said Tuesday its net profit in the first semester of 2008 jumped 1,438 percent to Rp631 billion from the same period last year on the back of a sharp rise in operating income.
Operating income jumped 59 percent to Rp5.836 trillion in the first half of this year from Rp3.665 trillion in the same period last year, EXCL President Director Hasnul Suhaimi said in a press statement.
He said the operating income rose as the total number of outgoing minutes increased ten-fold to 19.3 billion in the first semester of 2008 from 1.7 billion in a corresponding period last year.
The number of EXCL subscribers meanwhile increased 124 percent to 22.9 million in the first half of this year from 10.2 million a year earlier, he said.
The achievement suggests that subscribers appreciate EXCL's services which combine quality with affordable rates, he said.
The rise in the number of subscribers was the result of EXCL's tariff strategy which was implemented starting in the third quarter of 2007 and had received a positive response from the market, he said.
Touching on the increasing competition among mobile phone operators, he said EXCL would continue to improve its performance.
EXCL is not only lowering its tariffs but also increasing its capacity and maintaining the quality of its networks, he said.
Indonesia's debt swap program has only reached US$275 million some Rp2,55 trillion or far below its total debt of Rp550 trillion, a finance ministry official said.
The value of the debt swap program is still too low considering the huge potential of Indonesia's soft loans from creditor countries, Director General of Debt Management at the Finance Ministry, Rahmat Waluyanto, said here Monday.
The government had called on creditor countries to consider more seriously debt swap facilities for Indonesia, he said.
Their commitments in various international forums to support the implementation of the MDGs program, climate change, and other programs should be followed up by cooperation in debt-swap facilities at bilateral level, Waluyanto said.
Indonesia needed the debt swap program to increase its development financing sources and support implementation of priority programs in MDGs, climate change, education, health, and environment, he said.
He said so far, Indonesia had concluded debt-swap agreements with Germany, Italy and the United States.
Italy had pledged to convert US$24.2 million and 5.7 million Euro of the country's debt into a grant to be used for rehabilitation of natural disaster-hit-areas.
Both governments had agreed to allocate 14.6 million Euro for 10 projects in infrastructure, education, and health in the tsunami ravaged province of Aceh, that would be managed by the Aceh-Nias Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency BRR.
Meanwhile, the United States had agreed to include Indonesia in a debt-for-nature swap that will involve US$19.6 million of the country's debt to the U.S. being used to finance tropical forest conservation programs.
Under the Tropical Forest Fund, a portion of Indonesia's debt could be reduced and re-directed to finance conservation of the country's tropical forests which are considered to be among the world's most estensive and bio-diverse.
The Tropical Forest Fund was set up jointly by Indonesia, and the US and non-governmental organizations as swap partners, and will contribute funds at a minimum of 20 percent of Indonesia's debts or some US$3.92 million.
The rupiah fell five points to Rp9,265/9,270 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Monday as the US greenback strengthened against other major foreign currencies, a foreign exchange analyst said.
The dollar strengthened as investors were optimistic the US Federal Reserve will keep its interest rate at 2 percent, retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, Kostaman Thayib said on Monday.
Kostaman said the Fed was expected to keep its interest rate unchanged because it was still worried about the current financial crisis in the US.
The Fed's stable interest rate at 2 percent prompted investors to buy dollars causing the rupiah to weaken slightly on Monday, he said.
It was still hard for the rupiah to strengthen to Rp9,250 per dollar after it fluctuated within a range of Rp9,260 to Rp9,270 per dollar two days ago, he said.
Some analysts had earlier predicted the rupiah would continue to strengthen to below Rp9,250 per dollar, he said.
It was somewhat difficult for the rupiah to reach a level of Rp9,250 per dollar but the market was still optimistic about the rupiah's appreciation as a number of foreign investors were active in investing their capital in the domestic market, he said.
The Fed's two-day meeting to discuss a rise in its interest rate would prompt investors to actively engage in the domestic market owing to the higher difference between the dollar and rupiah interest rates, he said.
The dollar's appreciation against other major foreign currencies had encouraged investors to buy the greenback, he said.
The government and Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI will do their best to control the stubbornly high inflation rates in recent months, a chief economic minister said.
We will inform each other of any economic indicators for which we must be watchful such as the current high inflation rate, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday.
Sri Mulyani made the remarks following the transfer of post of chief economic minister from Boediono to her. 
The rupiah in the Jakarta inter-bank spot market on Wednesday afternoon strengthened to Rp9,243/9,245 against the US dollar after several times staying at the level between Rp9,275 and Rp9,300 to the greenback, an observer said.
The rupiah strengthened to below the level of Rp9,250 to the dollar after the government issued state bonds which are demanded by foreign investors in big amount, money market observer Edwin Sinaga said here Wednesday. 
The rupiah rose by 23 points on Wednesday afternoon from Rp9,266/9,272 on Tuesday afternoon. 
He said the local currency was expected to continue to strengthen to Rp9,235 to the dollar as positive sentiment from the offers on state bonds was still high.
The local unit would remain in the position following the two-day meeting of The Fed which was expected not to increase its interest rate as the US' economy is still in lethargy.    
We are optimistic that the US interest rate will remain stable at 2 percent, he said.
The rise in the rupiah's position was somewhat hampered by the sluggish regional stock market due to the weakening Wall Street stock exchange as the financial crisis was still going on in the United States.  
The local currency strengthened also because foreign investors including those from India, Singapore, Malaysia and the Middle East wished to sink their funds in the domestic market, he said.
According to him, the rupiah could appreaciate further but it would be difficult for it to reach the level of Rp9,000 per US dollar as foreign businesspeople invested their money in the country only for the short term.  
Foreign investors sink their capital for the long term only in the banking sector, he said.
The House of Representatives DPR's Budgetary Committee has agreed to an assumed economic growth rate of 6.0-6.4 percent in the 2009 state budget.
The committee at its working meeting with Finance Minister Sri Mulyani, State Minister for National Development Planning Paskah Suzetta and representatives from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry and Bank Indonesia the central bank on Thursday also agreed to other basic economic assumptions.
The meeting also agreed to the inflation rate forecast of 5.8-6.5 percent for 2009.
The other basic economic assumptions agreed to at the meeting included the rupiah's exchange rate against the dollar at Rp9,000-9,200, interest rate on Bank Indonesia's promissory notes SBI for three-month deposits at 7.5-8.5 percent, oil prices at US$95-120 a barrel, oil production at 927,000-950,000 barrels per day, and gross domestic product GDP at Rp5,200-Rp5,300 trillion.
Both the House and the government agreed to set a deficit in the 2009 state budget at 1.5-2.0 percent of the GDP.
State revenues and grants are projected at Rp1,070 trillion and state expenditures are estimated at Rp1,152.2 trillion so there will be a budget deficit of around Rp82.1 trillion or 1.6 percent of the GDP, Chairman of the House Budgetary Committee Harry Azhar Azis said.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani meanwhile said that in general, the government could accept what had been decided at the meeting.
Indonesia has the potential of securing climate change-related offshore loans worth US$1.2 billion which can be used to help offset a deficit in its state budget, an official said.
We hope the loans will reach US$1.2 billion, State Minister for National Development Planning/Chief of the National Development Planning Agency Bappenas Paskah Suzetta said here Thursday.
But he stopped short of revealing whether the loans could be obtained this year or next year.
He said the agency had prepared a matrix of climate change-related policies which constituted the government's agenda as a prerequisite to obtain the soft loans.
The loans which carried an interest rate of 0.65 percent were payable in 30 years, he said.
We are in the process of offering the same matrix of policies to Japan, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, France and Germany, he said.
Bappenas had so far received loan commitments worth US$200 million from the Japanese government, he said.
The rupiah strengthened at more than Rp9,200 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday as investors were active in buying the local unit, a foreign exchange analyst said.
The main factor of the rupiah's strengthening is the government's success in issuing most-sought global bonds worth US$2.2 billion, Kostaman Thayib, retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, said on Thursday.
The rupiah rose 54 points to Rp9,200/9,210 per dollar on Thursday compared to Rp9,254/9,260 per dollar the day before.
The US dollar inflows into the domestic market gave a boost to the rupiah so that it strengthened at more than Rp9,200 per dollar, he said.
An upward trend in banking interest rates was another factor of the rupiah's strengthening and the local unit was expected to edge closer to Rp9,100 per dollar, he said.
Domestic banks were expected to adjust their lending rates following Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI's decision to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.50 percent early this month, he said.
He predicted the rupiah would continue to strengthen to Rp9,000 per dollar although it would be somewhat difficult for the Indonesian currency to reach the level.
At present the rupiah was very stable but monetary authorities must prevent it from strengthening at a fast pace for fear it would easily weaken, he said.
The rupiah would likely put under negative pressure ahead of 2009 general elections. But peaceful elections would make the rupiah more stable, he said. 
Publicly-listed instant noodle maker PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Tbk plans to sell 2.67 percent of its treasury stocks to strategic investors.
All the shareholders have agreed to the plan, Indofood Vice President Director Fransiscus Welirang said following an annual and extraordinary shareholders' meeting here on Friday.
At the meeting, the management of Indofood asked shareholders to agree to a cut in the amount of paid-up and paid-in capital to Rp878.04 billion from Rp944.42 billion previously as the company intended to sell its treasury stocks.
The company decided to take the decision to adjust itself with the new law on limited liability companies. 
Under the law, a company is only allowed to control its buy-back shares as treasury stocks for a maximum of three years.
Indofood Finance Director Thomas Tjhie said all the remaining treasury stocks could be sold by August. 
We will sell them to strategic investors. Hopefully, the process can be completed by August. 
The meeting also decided to pay 40 percent of the company's net profit of Rp980.36 billion last year, or Rp43 a share, as dividends.
The rupiah in the Jakarta inter-bank spot market on Monday afternoon dropped to Rp9,225/9,230 from Rp9,205/9,215 against the US dollar last weekend as market players were still actively buying the US currency. 
The rupiah dropped due to the high negative sentiment in the market following the increased world crude oil price which reached more than US$141 per barrel, foreign exchange analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara publicly listed, Rully Nova, said here Monday.
He said the decrease in the rupiah's rate last Friday and Monday was considered normal after the Indonesian unit drastically increased to below the level of Rp9,200 to US dollar previously. 
So, he said, there was no problem with the rupiah as it was still in a stable and safe condition.
The rupiah weakened also because e Wall Street was in a bullish condition which affected the regional stock exchange as the world crude oil price strengthened.    
The world crude oil price rose due to increased political tensions between Israel and Iran, he said.     
He said this condition would not last long as foreign investors were showing great interest in sinking their capital on the domestic market as Bank Indonesia the central bank would increase its reference interest rate due to the high inflation in June.  
Market players are now waiting for monthly reports from the Central Bureau of Statistics to see whether or not the inflation in June would remain high, he said.
He said the rupiah was expected not to move farther as Bank Indonesia wished the local currency to remain below the level of Rp9,300 to the US dollar as such a position was considered stable.
Bank Indonesia continued to monitor the market to keep the rupiah below Rp9,300 to the US greenback as the central bank still had an adequate amount of foreign exchange.  
The Anti Debt Coalition KAU has called on the government to capitalize on the summit which will take place near Lake Yoga Hokaido, Japan, on July 7-9, 2008 to ask for the writing off of Indonesia's foreign debt. 
This had to be done by Indonesia on the ground that 91 percent of its bilateral foreign debt which now stood at Rp258.96 trillion was to G-8 countries, KAU Chairman Dani Setiawan said here on Thursday. 
The debt writting off was a form of responsibility of socio-economic crisis confronting Indonesian people as a result of foreign loan transactions. 
The crisis is caused by practices of economic liberalization, privatization and the lifting of subsidies recommended by creditor countries, Setiawan said. 
According to KAU data on list of Indonesia's foreign debt with G8 member countries, Japan posed a bilateral creditor in Indonesia with its outstanding debt totalling Rp186.38 trillion. 
G8 member countries should be urged to write off Indonesian debt without any conditions to South countries including Indonesia. According to KAU , a commitment to give debt relief was made by G8 at their meeting in Birmingham in 2005. 
Indonesia will host the 11th annual meeting and 7th annual technical assistance and training forum of the Asia Pacific Group APG on Money Laundering on July 7-11.
The meeting will take place at the Bali International Convention Center, Westin Hotel in Bali, Indonesia, spokesman of the Center for Financial Transaction Reporting and Analysis PPATK Natsir Kongah said on Friday.
He said more than 260 officials of financial intelligence units FIU from APG member countries and 19 international organizations as well as 6 observers from Asia and the Pacific would take part in the Bali meeting.
They would discuss a wide range of crucial issues related to money laundering and terrorism funding offences, he said.
Publicly-listed aviation service company PT Indonesia Air Transport Tbk IATA plans to buy three more helicopters worth more than US$30 million until 2009, its director said.
This year we may only buy one helicopter. 
We are still calculating the exact value of the three helicopters.
To be sure, it will exceed US$30 million, Ending Ridwan said on Thursday.
The funds needed to buy the helicopters would originate from banking loans and bonds, he said.
Currently, IATA is operating 10 chartered planes and 6 helicopters.
Ridwan said IATA won a US$3.6 million contract from nickel-mining company PT Inco Tbk for the provision of chatered aircraft to serve the Soroako-Ujung Pandang route this year.
The lease contract will hopefully raise the company's income by 50 percent from Rp217 billion in 2007, he said. 
Rupiah on the Jakarta inter-bank spot market on Tuesday morning strengthened to Rp9,212 against US dollar as the US greenback weakened to Asia's main currencies especially Japanese yen. 
The rise in the rupiah rate shows a positive sentiment on the market as US dollar is entering the domestic market after the government offers state bonds in dollar, capital market observer Edwin Sinaga said here Tuesday. 
He said rupiah received external supports due to the improving Wall Streets stock exchange positively affecting the regional stock exchange including Japan's Nikkei index which rose 0.3 percent to 13.526.63 or increased by 45.15 points.  
We are expecting that rupiah will penetrate the level of Rp9,200 to US dollar this afternoon, the observer said.  
The sales of state bonds abroad won positive responses from foreign investors so that the needs of US dollars at home could be met although market players worried about the inflation rate which would be higher in June than that in May, he said. 
According to Edwin Sinaga, rupiah would in the near future approach the level of Rp9,100 to US dollar but it was still difficult for the local unit to reach the figure of Rp9,000 against the US currency. 
Rupiah is now considered in a safe position as Bank Indonesia the central bank has bigger amount of foreign exchanges in anticipation of possible pressure against the local unit, he said.
The increase in the rupiah rate was due to the weakening US dollar as financial crisis in the US continued, he said, adding that the US was also facing the increasing inflation rate which had created worries that the US economy would continue to weaken. 
State-owned Bank Mandiri BMRI has up to now extended Rp612.61 billion in credits under the People's Business Credit KUR scheme to 18,065 debtors in Kalimantan, BMRI deputy director Wayan Agus Mertayasa said.

The funds were distributed to 32,173 debtors in the economic sector, 85 debtors in the agricultural sector, 92 in the construction sector, 598 in trade, restaurant and hotel sectors, 84 in the service sector and 145 in the social service sector.
The rupiah moved closer to Rp9,200 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Monday morning as investors rushed for the local unit following Bank Indonesia BI's move to raise its benchmark interest rate to 8.75 percent last week.
BI's decision to raise its key rate by 25 basis points to 8.75 percent from 8.50 percent previously has led to a rush for the rupiah, Kostaman Thayib, retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, said on Monday.
The rupiah was trading Rp9,204/9,205 per dollar on Monday morning compared to the weekend closure of Rp9,213/9,219 per dollar, or an increase of nine points.
He said the rupiah received another boost as foreign investors rushed for state bonds so that state-owned companies' demand for the US greenback could be met quickly.
We are optimistic the rupiah still has a chance to strengthen to up to Rp9,200 per dollar on Monday evening, he said.
Earlier, the rupiah slightly strengthened by three points to Rp9,210 from Rp9,213 per dollar and moved closer to Rp9,200 per dollar as investors bought up the Indonesian currency, he said.
He asked monetary authorities to be wary of the rupiah's faster-than-expected appreciation for fear it would cause the rupiah to plunge more quickly.
The rupiah strengthened at Rp9,201/9,204 against the dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Tuesday evening after it hit Rp9,200 per dollar earlier in the day, a foreign exchange analyst said. 
The rupiah was trading above Rp9,200 per dollar as investors were careful in buying the Indonesian currency, Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk said on Tuesday.
The rupiah closed at Rp9,201/9,204 per dollar on Tuesday against Rp9,205/9,209 per dollar the day before, or an increase of four points. 
Rully said the rupiah hit the previous day's closure of Rp9,205 per dollar on Tuesday evening but investors speculated on buying the rupiah in small quantities causing the local unit to strengthen slightly.
The rupiah slightly appreciated against the greenback as investors focused their attention on the G-8 Group of Eight Industrialized Nations meeting in Japan discussing the US dollar's fall, he said.
He predicted the rupiah would continue to strengthen to up to Rp9,150 per dollar if global crude prices fell after they hit another record high of US$145 a barrel.
We are optimistic the rupiah will strengthen below Rp9,200 per dollar because of high positive sentiments, he said.
The rupiah's appreciation suggested that the Indonesian economy was performing well despite a global economic slowdown following the US financial crisis, he said.
Moreover, the high economic growth in China and India would contribute to economic growth in the rest of Asia including Indonesia, he said.
He said the dollar's depreciation against the Japanese yen over investors' worries about the US economic growt
Publicly-listed coal mining company PT Bukit Asam Tbk has decided to set aside 50 percent of its 2007 net profit totaling Rp760.2 billion to pay out dividends at Rp164.97 per share.
Compared to the dividend paid on budget year 2006, the amount of dividend per share this time is 56.52 percent higher, PT Bukit Asam President Director Sukrisno said following a general shareholders' meeting on Thursday night. 
The increase resulted from a 57-percent rise in net profit to Rp760 billion in 2007 from Rp486 billion the year before, he said.
Last year, PT Bukit Asam saw a 17-percent rise in its coal sales to Rp4.12 trillion from a year earlier, he said.
In the first quarter of 2008 alone, the company posted a net profit of Rp286.39 billion, with sales reaching Rp1.23 trillion. 
The first-quarter net profit represented a 44-percent rise from the same period last year, he said.
Meanwhile, the selling price of coal in the export market between January and March 2008 rose 36 percent to US$59.7 per ton. 
Exports accounted for 32 percent of our sales totaling 2.69 million tons during the January-March 2008 period, he said.
Over the period, domestic coal prices rose 29 percent to Rp484,000 per ton.
The rupiah rose 10 points to Rp9,300/9,310 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Friday evening following Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI's intervention in the money market, a money market observer said.
BI released funds from its foreign exchange reserves as part of a market intervention, causing the rupiah to strengthen to Rp9,300 per dollar, Edwin Sinaga said.
Sinaga said the rupiah needed to strengthen by a few more points to reach a level below Rp9,300 per dollar as hoped for by monetary authorities.
The rupiah is considered to be in safe position if it moves to below Rp9,300 per dollar, he said.
The rupiah's appreciation , however, evoked little enthusiasm among investors who were still careful in making transactions due to a persistent drop in global crude prices which on Friday stood at US$126 a barrel, he said.
But if the present conditions continued in the days ahead, the rupiah would further strengthen against the dollar, he said.
I am optimistic the rupiah will gain ground next week so it will appreciate to less than Rp9,300 per dollar, he said.
The rupiah's appreciation also resulted from a strengthening of the regional stock exchange's index after Wall Street's index strengthened, he said.
He predicted the market would give a positive response to the rupiah next week.
Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia Siti Ch Fadjrijah said that about ten banks planned this year to change the status of their syariah units into syariah commercial banks, like BRI Syariah, BNI Syariah, and Bukopin Syariah.
Some other banks, like Bank Panin when takin-over Bank Harfa Irna Gustia, and PT Bank Victoria International Tbk BVICwhen taking-over Bank Swaguna, also reported they planned to change their status into syariah banks, Fadjrijah told a syariah banking discussion held by banking and monetary news reporters in Jakarta Friday.
The other banks with the same plan include those to be taken over by an AL Barakah investor from Saudi Arabia.
Thus, this year there will be 10 wholly syariah banks, said Fadjrijah
refusing to reveal the names of the four other banks.
This development, she added, is an indication of the high potential of the syariah banks in Indonesia although their growth is still short of Bank Indonesia's expectations.
The potential of our syariah bank market is very high, but yet to be fully developed. 
And even a growth of five percent is still difficult to reach, she said.
She added that the assets of syariah banks in the first quarter fo 2008 had reached Rp37.6 trillion, and those of conventional banks Rp1,800 trillion, while the projected growth of syariah bank assets was set at 5 percent of those of conventional banks, or Rp 92 trillion.
The growth of syariah bank assets had reached 37 percent which is higher than that of conventional banks, but to reach 5 percent of the total of commercial bank assets is not easy, he added.
She said further that BI is constantly encouraging the development of syariah banks by increasing syariah services, opening more branch offices, including conversions from syariah units to syariah banks and reducing the capital required for the establishment of syariah banks.
Commercial banks, she added, can also use their branch offices to build a bank syariah channeling office. 
Many other things had been done by BI, but its growth cannot be so rapid has expected , she said.
In the meantime, commission XI deputy chairman of the House of Representatives Endin Soefihara said on the occasion that in the near future her office will finalize the syariah banking draft law with the government.
Hopefully it will be completed soon after the finance minister, legal affairs and human rights minister, and the religious minister, put their signature, he said.
Endin hoped that the law will encourage the establishment of new syariah commercial banks and syariah people's funding banks.
Publicly-listed plantation company PT Bakrie Sumatra Plantations Tbk said on Monday it had increased its stake in Netherlands-based Agri Resoruces BV to 51 percent by acquiring US$41.22 worth of additinal shares in the company.

Bakrie Sumatra also has the option to raise its stake in Agri Resources BV to 100 percent by 2011.
The rupiah edged closer to Rp9,200 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday as investors bought the local unit on the US dollar's depreciation against other major currencies.
The rupiah is expected to reach Rp9,200 per dollar or more because of investors' high interest in buying the local unit, Kostaman Thayib, retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, said on Thursday.
The rupiah closed at Rp9,205/9,208 per dollar on Thursday against Rp9,215/9,225 per dollar the day before.
He said investors were still careful in buying the rupiah on concern that anti-fuel oil price hike protests would continue.
We are optimistic that the rupiah will hit Rp9,200 per dollar after it stood at Rp9,210/9.220 per dollar for quite long time, he said.
The issuance of dollar-denominated global bonds was the main factor of the rupiah's appreciation, he said.
The rupiah received another boost after a number of foreign investors, particularly from the Middle East and Australia, expressed keen interest in raising their investment in the domestic market due to the high difference between the rupiah and dollar interest rates, he said.
We predict the rupiah will stay in a quite safe position for a long time despite the stubbornly high inflation rates, he said.
The high on-month inflation rate in June would likely prompt Bank Indonesia BI to raise its benchmark interest rate BI Rate despite calls for the central bank to keep it at 8.50 percent, he said.
An increase in the BI Rate would encourage banks to readjust their lending rates, he said.
Publicly-listed coal mining company PT Bumi Resources Tbk said on Monday its net profit in the first quarter of 2008 rose 29 percent to US$103.3 million from a year earlier on higher demand for the commodity in the export market.
Net sales went up to US$663.59 million from US$577.91 million, causing operating income to increase to US$160.93 million from US$112.27 million, the company said.
Overall, sales volume in the January-March 2008 period dropped 14 percent to 12.5 million tons from 14.5 million tons. However, average selling prices jumped to US$41.70 a ton from US$58.34 a ton.
Indonesia is the world's biggest coal producer.
Coal mining companies are enjoying windfall profit from soaring coal prices due to the global crude price spiral leading to higher demand for coal as alternative energy.
Cable producer PT Jembo Cable Company Tbk has set itself the target of increasing its sales from Rp735 billion to Rp960 billion in 2008, a company spokesman said.
We are optimistic we will achieve our sales target by increasing our exports to Bangladesh and the Middle East. 
Our cable export contracts have already reached a value of Rp487 billion, the company's president director, Antonius Benady, said here Monday.
In the first quarter of 2008, the company's sales reached a total value of Rp202 billion and its net income Rp9.9 billion.
Benady said, the company was not planning to make any major investment in 2008. 
We only intend to make an investment in 2008 of Rp10 billion for rehabilitation of our factories' infrastructure, he added.
The investment funds would be obtained from the company's profits made last year.
At its annual shareholders' meeting , PT Jembo had decided not to pay any dividend this year because its earnings were still in a minus position.
Benady expressed hope the company's earnings would next year improve sufficiently so it would be able to pay dividends. 
The company had agreed to put up some of its assets -- factories, land and buildings -- as collateral to get an additional loan from Bank Mandiri.
Bank Mandiri had initially agreed to give us a loan of Rp149 billion but the figure will now be raised to Rp200 billion.
The funds from the loan carrying an interest rate of 13 percent will be used as working capital, he said.
The government will auction three series of state debentures with a combined indicative price of Rp3 trillion on June 10, 2008, a finance ministry spokesman said.
Head of the Finance Ministry's Public Relations Samsuar Said stated here on Wednesday the three series of state debentures that would be auctioned were series FR004, FR0048 and FR0049.

In the meantime, Series FR0049 will carry a 9 percent fixed interest rate and mature on September 15, 2013, he said.
The auction of the state bonds will be carried out through a mechanism which was so far applied by the central bank, Bank Indonesia BI, with the auction participants having been decided in the first place.
He said the government had the right to sell the three series of state debentures at a price lower or higher than the indicative price mentioned earlier.
Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI is likely to take a bold decision at the next meeting of its board of governors to send a positive signal to the market that it cares about easing the prevailing inflationary pressure.
We must take a decision to give a signal to the market that BI cares about easing the inflationary pressure, BI Senior Deputy Governor Miranda S Goeltom said on Tuesday.
BI would always monitor the inflationary pressure in the months ahead and would give appropriate responses to it, she said.
But right now I cannot say to what extent BI will respond to it, she said.
The Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said on Monday the on-month inflation rate in May jumped to 1.41 percent, bringing the calendar year inflation rate to 5.47 percent and the on-year inflation rate to 10.38 percent.
Credit rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia Pefindo has affirmed its idA ratings for private television station PT Surya Citra Televisi SCTV and the company's Rp425 billion bonds I/2003 due this month and Rp575 billion bonds II/2007 with a stable outlook.
The ratings reflect SCTV's strong position in the country's free-to-air television TV station industry, favorable operating performance and its strong cash flow protection, Pefindo said in a statement on Monday.
However, the ratings are constrained by the company's dependence on certain program suppliers, intense competition within the TV station industry, and the potential of high inflation which might impede its revenue growth.
SCTV is the second company to enter the free-to-air TV station market in Indonesia.
It started its commercial operations regionally in 1990 with its head office located in Surabaya.
In 1993, SCTV commenced to broadcast nationally and moved its head office to Jakarta.
As per December 31, 2007, SCTV was 99.99 percent owned by PT Surya Citra Media Tbk. SCM, an investment holding company, which has been listed at the Indonesia Stock Exchange since mid-2002.
At the end of 2007, SCM's shareholders consisted of PT Abhimata Mediatama 78.69 percent, The Northern Trust Company S/A Northern 7.90 percent, and members of the public owning less than 5 percent each 13.41 percent.
The budget deficit would be the balance between state revenues and grants estimated at Rp937.8 trillion and state expenditures projected at Rp1,020.1 trillion, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Monday.
The government said based on latest economic conditions until May 2008, a deficit in the 2008 state budget is projected to reach Rp82.3 trillion or 1.8 percent of the gross domestic product GDP.
She said Rp252.3 trillion of the expenditures would go to subsidy, including Rp200.8 trillion in energy subsidy.
The energy subsidy consists of Rp132.1 trillion in fuel subsidy and Rp88.5 trillion in electricity subsidiy, she said.
The forecast was based on an assumed oil price of US$110 to US$115 a barrel, an oil production of 0.927 million barrels a day, and a rupiah exchange rate of Rp9,000 to Rp9,200 per dollar, she said.
The lower-than-expected deficit due in part to a cut in fuel subsidy following the fuel oil price hikes in May may further go up if global crude prices jump beyond expectation, she said.
In the revised 2008 state budget, the government had set state revenues and grants at Rp895 trillion and expenditures at Rp989.3 trillion so that the budget deficit was expected to reach 2.1 percent of the GDP.
The state revenues consist of domestic receipts of Rp892 trillion and grants of Rp2.9 trillion.
The domestic receipts comprise tax receipts of Rp609.2 trillion and non-tax state revenues of Rp282.8 trillion.
Meanwhile, state expenditures consist of the central government's expenditures of Rp696.7 trillion and the transfer of Rp292.6 trillion in funds to regional governments.
In the revised 2008 state budget, the budget allocations for subsidy reach Rp234.41 trillion, including Rp126.82 trillion in fuel subsidy, Rp60.29 trillion in electricity subsidy, Rp8.59 trillion in food subsidy, Rp7.81 trillion in fertilizer subsidy, Rp1.02 trillion in seed subsidy.
The rupiah on the Jakarta interbank spot market at the closing session on Tuesday afternoon dropped to Rp9,315/9,320 against the US dollar compared to Rp9,310/9,310 on Monday afternoon due to increasing negative pressures on the market. 
The rupiah decreased mainly because of greater market pressures due to the weakening regional share market following the drop in the Wall Street bourse, retail banking director of publicly-listed PT Bank Mega, Kostaman Thayib, said here Tuesday. 
The rupiah came under pressure also because of market players' worries over recent violence allegedly committed by the FPI Islam Defenders' Front against the National Alliance for Freedom of Religion and Belief. 
However, the pressure eased somewhat after Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank, intervened in the market to prevent the rupiah from plunging further, he said.
He said BI was rather prudent in intervening as the regional share market was somewhat under pressure affecting the rupiah as the Japanese yen was strengthening. 
However, the rupiah was expected to reach the level of Rp9,300 against US dollar or even exceed the level, he said.  
The Indonesian unit moved only in a range between Rp9,310 and Rp9,315 to the dollar indicating the difference between interest to sell and interest to buy it was small, he said.     
The condition will make the rupiah go up on the following days as the fuel oil price hike did not have a significant effect on the local unit, he said.   
Kostaman Thayib said he was optimistic that the rupiah would late next week reach a level below Rp9,300 against the US dollar in conformity with the wish of the monetary authority BI. 
If the rupiah could stay below Rp9,300 to the US dollar, the currency would be in a relatively safe position, he said. 
To support the rupiah, BI was also expected to increase its reference interest rate so that foreign investors would continue to play on the domestic market, he said.   
The fuel subsidy in the state budget will amount to Rp198.7 trillion if the crude price in the world market reaches US$150 per barrel at the end of 2008, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said.
We have done a simulation to see the position of the state budget if the crude price in the world market reaches US$135 and US$150 per barrel, the minister told the Financial Affairs Commission of the House of Representatives DPR on Wednesday night.
She said the official formulation for the state budget in 2008 her ministry had submitted to the DPR was made with the average price assumption of US$110 per barrel.
The US$110 per barrel is an average price assumption for 2008 where the average price of oil from now until the end of the year is set at US$120 per barrel, she said.
But if the average price of oil from now until the end of 2008 was US$135 per barrel this meant that the average price for the whole year would be US$122 per barrel.
Or, if it reached US150 per barrel, the average price of oil in the whole year of 2008 would be US$134 per barrel, the minister said.
She said fluctuations in the price of crude in the world market would affect the state budget.
If the average price of oil in the world market reaches US$150 per barrel at the end of the year, the fuel subsidy in the state budget will reach RP198.7 trillion, she said.
The minister said the amount was far bigger than the official amount that had been proposed to the DPR.
She said the government would keep on maintaining the state budget deficit at 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product, although the oil price scenario reached US$150 per barrel.
Previously, at a meeting with the DPR's Budgetary Committee on Monday, the government predicted the realization of the state budget deficit up to the end of the year would reach RP82.3 trillion or 1.8 percent of the gross domestic product.
Indonesia's net foreign exchange reserves fell 2.2 percent to US$57.464 billion at the end of May from US$58.770 billion a month earlier, the central bank Bank Indonesia -BI said on Thursday.
In the meantime, primary money in circulation in that period increased to Rp333.996 trillion from Rp324.186 trillion following an increase in the circulation of banknotes and coins based on the BI's balance of accounts.
According to the BI, bank notes and coins in circulation increased from Rp202.477 trillion at the end of April 2008 to 209.081 trillion at the end of May.
Banks' balance of accounts at BI increased from Rp212.440 trillion to Rp123.817 trillion.
The net domestic assets or base money minus net foreign exchange reserves were recorded at negative Rp8.890 trillion at the end of May as compared with the Rp27.254 trillion at the end of April 2008.
Bank Indonesia BI has predicted that the high inflation rate in 2009 in the country can be lowered to 6.5-7.5 percent, a BI deputy governor said.
If everything runs well, the inflation rate in 2009 can be lowered to a range between 6.5 and 7.5 percent, although in 2008 the inflation rate is at a range of 11.5 - 12.5 percent, Hartadi A Sarwono told a journalist workshop here on Friday.
He said the high inflation rate in 2008 was fueled by the impact of the fuel oil price hikes but because the impact of the fuel oil price hikes was one-shot matter, inflation in the following year would go down again.
Referring to the previous estimate of 5.5 - 7.5 percent by the House Budgetary Committee, Hartadi said it was an optimistic target.
Based on the results of a meeting of BI's Board of Governors, the most realistic rate is between 6.5 and 7.5 percent.
But it would be good to see the 6.5 plus - minus percent, he added.
In order to keep the inflation rate under control, BI will continue to give signs of issuing monetary polices such as raising the BI interest rate, he said.
State Enterprises Minister Sofyan Djalil said state-owned PT Krakatau Steel KS's privatization will have to be done though an Initial Public Offering IPO which his ministry had scheduled to take place in September 2008. 
We have decided to privatize Krakatau Steel through an IPO but the decision is still subject to approval by the House of Representatives DPR, Djalil told the press here Wednesday.
He said his ministry would challenge the House and the KS management to agree to carry out the IPO as soon as possible. 
Djalil's statements come amid a controversy on whether the state's sole steel-making company should be privatized through an IPO or a strategic sale. 
Some world-class steel companies such as Arcelor Mittal, BlueScope, Tata Steel, Pohong Steel, and Essar Steel were reported to be keenly interested in acquiring a stake in KS through a strategic purchase. 
Djalil said privatizing KS , either through an IPO or strategic sale, would be a good move to increase the company's production capacity. 
To us, the most important thing is achieving the aim of raising KS's production capacity to at least five million tons per year, he added.
The funds raised through the privatization would not be used for ground field construction as the company already had sufficient infrastructure such as ports, land, electricity and water. 
The funds from the IPO will be used to improve the company's technology, he said.
However, some analysts opined that the current negative sentiment in the market would be unfavorable for KS to list its shares at the Indonesian Stock Exchange.
If the market situation is negative like now, we could release five percent of shares first.
When the market improves, we can list an additional 40 percent of the shares, Djalil said.
The minister admitted the government was having difficulty realizing KS's privatization as the plan was not only a technical-economic but also a political-economic matter. 
Therefore I ask the parliament to make a decision on KS's privatization soon.
We should not get stuck in discussions, much less fail to make a decision by the end of the year, he said.
Djalil gave the assurance that no government official would receive any commission fee from anyone in the IPO process.
State officials are not allowed to receive any commission fees.
But in an IPO there will be various standard fees paid such as underwriter fee, legal fee, consulting fee, and arranger fee.
When state officials receive such fees, they will face prosecution under the law against gratification, he added.
Djalil declined to elaborate on who would be the underwriter and consultant in the planned Krakatau Steel's IPO.
Taxation Director General Darmin Nasution said the government's tax receipts in the first five months of 2008 increased 47.63 percent to Rp217.3 trillion from Rp147.2 trillion in the same period a year earlier.
Tax receipts from the oil and gas sector accounted for 60 percent, he said here on Friday.
He said the figure was 13 percent higher than the target.
Nasution explained that non-oil/non-gas tax receipts in the January-May 2008 period stood at Rp189.4 trillion, which increased 45.19 percent compared with the Rp130.5 trillion collected in the same period last year.
Oil and gas taxes collected in the January-May 2008 period were valued at Rp27.8 trillion, an increase by 66.8 percent compared with the Rp16.7 trillion collected in the corresponding period in 2007.
The non-oil.non-gas tax receipts were collected from land and building taxes worth Rp5.6 trillion or an increase of 500 percent from Rp914 billion in 2007.
Receipts from income tax also rose 39.4 percent and from luxury good sales taxes by 46.08 percent.
Non-oil.non-gas tax receipts in May alone rose 60.61 percent to Rp38.trillion compared with that in the same period in 2007 which stood at Rp23.7 trillion, Nasution said.
He said total tax receipts in the January - May 2008 period accounted for 40.66 percent of the target set by the government in 2008.
The World Bank said still had no plan to finance the Jakarta monorail project because it was not included in its priority projects but it was ready to hold dialogs on the possibility of providing financial assistance.
We have no specific discussions on the matter at the moment because it is not part of our priority.
 But we are open for dialogs on ideas not yet included in our priority projects, WB Representative in Indonesia Joachim von Amsberg told ANTARA here over the weekend.
He said that the bank's commitment was to assist government's priority programs or projects such as infrastructure in the region and poverty alleviation programs.
The fate of the Jakarta monorail project, which was initiated by the Jakarta administration, is still uncertain until today after the central government stated it would only bear some of the project financing.
Dedy S Priatna of the National Development Planning Board Bappenas said the central government, before taking part in the project, set a condition that the Jakarta administration and PT Jakarta Monorail JM as the executor of the project, should first make a calculation on the budget of the project.
The office of the coordinating minister for economic affairs has written to the Jakarta administration informing that matter, he said.
He said that the calculation must be carried out by an independent appraisal agency. 
If its economic calculation is not feasible, the central government will not take part in the project and would prefer to give it to private companies, he said.
The National Development Planning Board Bappenas said recent fuel price hikes would affect projects financed with external loans, Syarial Loetan of Bappenas said.
In general, construction projects which are multi-years in nature would be affected.
Usually contractors have taken such a possibility into account as a price escalation when they are to take part in a tender for such project, he said here on Sunday.
In this case, creditors usually made available a budget surplus for a price escalation based on the value of their appraisal, he said.
Such a surplus is not available for projects affected by policy reforms, however, Syahrial said.
He said that a price escalation could also happen due to increase in the inflation caused by factors other than a fuel price hike.
We will ask for approval from the creditors to use the escalation price facility, he said.
The rupiah fell 22 points to Rp9,350/9,360 per dollar on Monday morning as investors bought the dollar following last Friday's rise in global crude prices to US$130 a barrel, a money market observer said.
The market pressure on the rupiah was quite strong so that the Indonesian currency weakened to Rp9,355 per dollar before it returned to Rp9,350 per dollar on Monday morning, Kostaman Thayib, retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, said.
I think the rupiah will continue to weaken due to the absence of a positive sentiment from the internal market despite Bank Indonesia's assurance to control the rupiah's movement, he said.
Bank Indonesia BI was likely to intervene in the market again in view of the increasingly heavier pressure on the rupiah, he said.
The central bank would release funds from its foreign exchange earnings to ease pressure on the local unit, he said. 
He said the rupiah was expected to trade below Rp9,350 if the central bank intervened in the market.
The central bank wants to see the rupiah trading below Rp9,300 per dollar this year.
I am optimistic if BI continues to monitor the rupiah's exchange rate and intervene in the market the ru
Indonesia's balance of payments NPI in the first quarter of 2008 recorded a surplus of US$1 billion with the total amount of payments recorded at US$59 billion, Bank Indonesia BI said.
It said the country's foreign exchange reserves stood at US$57.464 billion in the month ended on May 30, 2008.
The NPI surplus originated from a US$2.8 billion surplus in current account transactions fueled by an excess of exports over imports and remittances from migrant Indonesian workers aboard. 
The growth of current account transactions indicated that the external sector still gave positive contributions to the domestic economy's performance, it said.
Exports in the first quarter of 2008 were valued at US$34.4 billion f.o.b, up 29.2 percent from the same period last year.
Oil and gas exports recorded the highest growth at 61.7 percent, followed by non-oil/non-gas exports which grew 21.8 percent, it said. 
A surge in the prices of oil and several key non-oil/non-gas commodities such as palm oil, rubber and tin coupled with rising demand in the export market contributed to the increase in the export value.
In the meantime, imports reached US$26.8 billion f.o.b, up 41.9 percent, suggesting that there were still robust economic activities at home.
The surplus in current account transactions offset a US$1.4 billion deficit in capital and financial transactions partly caused by a drop in foreign portfolio capital inflows to the country.
The drop was triggered by the global financial market which had not yet recovered from the US subprime mortgage crisis, coupled with investors' negative perception of the state budget's resistance to the pressure of global crude price spiral.
The four investment management companies are PT Mega Global Investama, PT Platinum Investama, PT Bali Securities and PT United Asia Securities.
The revocation of the companies' permits is effective as of May 28, 2008, Ngalim said in a release on Tuesday.
Ngalim said the four investment management companies were banned from doing business as investment managers.
They were also required to settle all their obligations to other concerned parties.
Besides, Bapepam also revoked the license of security company PT Pentasena Arthasentosa.
The revocation was indicated in Bapepam's letter of June 5, 2008, he said.
The government has promised to give a tax incentive to foreign and domestic investors for following regulations under the regional and national spatial master plans RTRW, Director General for Spatial Planning Affairs Dr Ir I.F. Poermomosidhi MSc said.
 The provisions on the tax incentives will be stipulated in a special government regulations on incentives, the director general said on the sidelines of the popularization of Government Regulation PP No. 26 / 2008 on RTRWN at the National Development Planning Board Beppenas building here on Monday.
They will enjoy the facilities if, for example, the investors only use 40 percent of the 80 percent land they are allowed to use or on which to build a two-storey rather than a four-storey building, the director general said.
The director general said that the PP also contained a provision which regulated the involvement of regional administrations in providing incentives, particularly with regard to space use in their regions.
The values and types of the incentives are to be decided by the regional administrations concerned, the director general said.
Based on article 118 of the PP, there will also be disincentives for those who disobey the RTRWB such as the imposition of high tax, restriction of infrastructure facilities, imposition of compensation and penalties.
Indonesia's on-month inflation rate jumped to 1.41 percent in May due to fuel oil price hikes and speculations in the runup to the government's decision to raise fuel oil prices, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said.
The May 2008 inflation rate brought the calendar-year inflation rate to 5.47 percent and the on-year inflation rate to 10.38 percent, BPS Chief Rusman Heriawan said on Monday.
It is for the first time since October 2005 - when fuel oil prices were doubled - that all 45 cities surveyed recorded inflation, he said.
The BPS noted that the transportation, communication and financial service sectors contributed 2.23 percent to the monthly inflation rate, followed by the food sector 2.23 percent, and the housing, water, electricity, gas and fuel sectors 1.58 percent.
In May the prices of gasoline rose by 8.59 percent to an average of Rp4,887 from Rp4,500 a liter in April, adding 0.29 percent to the monthly inflation rate of 1.41 percent, he said.
The average fuel price of Rp4,887 a liter was based on the old price of Rp4,500 a liter in the first 23 days of May 2008 and the new price of Rp6,000 a liter in the remaining 8 days, he said.
The LPG price rose by 0.18 percent in May from a month earlier due to a shortage of the commodity, he said.
The bureau noted that the price of a 3-kg gas cylinder at the consumer's level increased by an average of Rp17,500 in May from Rp15,000 a month earlier while the price of 12-kg gas cylinders rose to Rp65,000 from Rp55,000.
The increase in rice prices contributed 0.13 percent to the on-month inflation rate in May.
The rice price hikes occurred in all cities in the country, with Banten recording the highest increase at 8.83 percent, he said.
Actually, speculations on whether or not the government would carry through the fuel price hike plan also contributed significantly to inflation, namely by around 0.5 percent, he said.
So, even if the fuel oil prices were not raised, the speculations themselves contributed 0.5 percent to the monthly inflation rate, he said.
Therefore, it would be difficult for the government to achieve its inflation rate target of 11 percent at the end of 2008 because of heavy inflationary pressures from July to December this year.
The rupiah edged closer to Rp9,300 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Tuesday evening after Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI intervened in the money market, a foreign exchange analyst said.
BI's intervention proved effective so the rupiah continued to edge closer to Rp9,300 per dollar though its appreciation happened slowly, Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk said.
The rupiah strengthened to Rp9,303/9,305 per dollar on Tuesday after it closed at Rp9,313/9,326 per dollar the day before.
He said BI wanted the rupiah to remain below Rp9,300 per dollar as this level was considered safe for the Indonesian economy.
The rupiah's chance of strengthening to below Rp9,300 per dollar was wide open, he said.
He said the rupiah should strengthen to below Rp9,300 per dollar now that the US greenback was weakening against other major foreign currencies, including the euro and yen.
The rupiah received another boost after the Deposit Insurance Agency LPS raised its interest rate to 8.50 percent from 8.25 percent previously, he said.
The increase in the LPS interest rate , coupled with a strengthening of the regional stock exchange's index, was the main factor in the rupiah's appreciation, he said.
He said the rise in the LPS interest rate triggered by BI's decision to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.50 percent early this month was expected to encourage foreign investment inflows into the country.
A number of Middle Eastern investors had invested in the country's banking sector, he said.
In addition, 28 Australian banking analysts and fund managers were holding a road show in Indonesia to explore the possibility of investment in the country.
Judging by foreign investors' high interest in investing in the domestic market, we are optimistic the national economy will grow at a fast pace, he said.
Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves will increase following the issuance of global bonds worth US$2.2 billion this month, a central bank official said.
We were not directly involved in the global bond roadshow but it the issuance of global bonds will raise our foreign exchange reserves, Deputy Bank Indonesia Governor B Hartadi A. Sarwono said on Wednesday.
The global bonds are divided into Indo 14 bonds worth US$300 million, Indo 18 bonds worth US$900 million and Indo 8 bonds worth US$1 billion.
The bonds are issued at a yield of 7.75 percent.
We were not directly involved in the roadshow.
That is the business of the government as the issuer, Hartadi said.
Head of the Fiscal Policies Board at the Finance Ministry Anggito Abimanyu meanwhile said the value of the bonds issued matched the market demand.
The issuance of the global bonds is part of the government's efforts to meet part of funds to finance the state budget.
The government has projected a deficit in the 2008 state budget at Rp82.3 trillion or 1.8 percent of the country's gross domestic product GDP.
The deficit will result from the difference between state expenditures estimated at Rp1,020.1 trillion and state receipts and grants projected at Rp937.8 trillion.
In the revised 2008 state budget, the government had previously projected state receipts and grants at Rp895 trillion and state expenditures at Rp989.3 trillion so that the state budget deficit would reach 2.1 percent of the GDP.
International stock rating agency Fitch Ratings has assigned a National Long-term Issuer rating of 'Aidn' with a stable outlook to PT Bank Syariah Muamalat Indonesia Tbk Muamalat.
At the same time, Fitch also assigned an expected rating of 'A-idn' A minusidn to Muamalat's proposed IDR400 billion, 10-year subordinated mudaraba bond, callable at the end of the fifth year, the Singapore-based agency said in a statement on Friday.
The rating reflects Muamalat's position as the second largest player in the small but fast growing Islamic banking industry in Indonesia, its satisfactory profitability as well as improved financing quality, with its relatively lower capital levels mitigated by increased provisions set aside for non-performing financing NPF in 2007.
As the second largest Islamic bank with a 29% market share of the Islamic banking industry's total assets at end-2007 albeit only 0.5% of overall banking industry's total assets, net financing margin NFM on Muamalat's financing operations increased to 7.9% in 2007 from 6.4% in 2004 due to better funding structure.
The proportion of lower cost deposits increased to about 50% of total deposits at end-2007 from 38% at end-2004.
Muamalat's assets grew rapidly albeit slower than the industry average, at 38% CAGR over 2002-2007, thanks partly to expansion in its distribution network with total offices increased to 213 at end-2007 from 66 offices at end-2002. 
Gross NPF declined to 3.0% of total financing at end-2007 Islamic banking industry: 4.1% from 5.7% at end-2006 thanks to restructuring efforts and better macroeconomic conditions in Indonesia.
The amount of NPF fell to Rp255 billion at the end of 2007 from Rp379 billion at the end of 2006.
Provision cover was raised to about 88.5% of NPF at the end of 2007 from 33.8% at the end of 2006, and this should help cushion any rise in NPF ahead given the more challenging operating conditions in 2008.
Muamalat's capital ratio is below the banking industry's average, with total CAR declining to 10.7% at the end of 2007 from 14.2% at the end of 2006 overall banking industry's : 19.2% at the end of 2007 due to strong financing growth as well as a high dividend payout ratio 78% in 2004-2006.
A proposed subordinated debt issuance in 2008 and a planned rights issue in 2009 are expected to help strengthen the bank's total CAR and raise the level above the 12% minimum target set internally by the bank.
Muamalat was established in 1991 as the first Islamic bank in Indonesia.
The Islamic Development Bank IDB injected capital in 1999 after Muamalat ran into financial difficulties during the Asian financial crisis and became the largest shareholder with a 28.01% stake at the end of 2007. 
Other substantial shareholders include Boubyan Bank Kuwait 21.28%, and Atwill Holding Limited 15.32%.
The government will not change its budget deficit-financing scenario although a deficit in the revised 2008 state budget fell Rp12.2 trillion to Rp82.3 trillion or 1.8 percent of the country's gross domestic product GDP, an official said.
That is the ceiling... 
If the ceiling is no longer needed, we will not scrap it, Head of the Fiscal Policy Board at the Finance Ministry Anggito Abimanyu said on Monday.
Under the scenario, the government would continue to set itself the target of withdrawing program loans worth US$2.9 billion, issuing state bonds worth Rp117 trillion and earning Rp500 billion from the privatization of state firms this year, he said.
Asked whether the government would withdraw program loans or issue state bonds in reaction to the current market for state bonds, he said it would continue to withdraw funds from the two funding sources.
Under the current situation, we must take intermediary steps.
We will continue to issue state bonds even at higher cost but at an acceptable level, he said.
On the contrary, if the government did not withdraw program loans, the economy would grow at a slow pace because the loans would be used to finance the construction of infrastructure facilities, he said.
State mining company PT Aneka Tambang Tbk Antam has teamed up with BHP Billiton to develop nickel laterite deposits in Indonesia. 
To develop the project, Antam has signed a Joint Venture Agreement JVA with BHP Billiton for the development and exploitation of nickel laterite deposits in Indonesia's eastern province. 
The ownership structure between JVA and BHP Billiton had been set at 50:50. 
The JVA was signed in Jakarta by Antam's president director D. Aditya Sumanagara and Jimmy Wilson, President of Stainless Steel Materials BHP Billiton, Antam's corporate secretary Bimo Budi Satryo said in Jakarta on Wednesday. 
The JVA between Antam and BHP Billiton was conditional, namely an approval of the Board of BHP Billiton must be secured, hopefully next month.
The signing of the JVA followed the signing of a Heads Of Agreement HOA in Perth between Antam and BHP Billiton in February last year.
The alliance with BHP Billiton is in line with Antam's strategy to enter further into the downstream metal processing sector applying higher technology.
The strategic alliance with BHP Billiton is also expected to reduce risks and the mineral deposit development cost, he said.
The Finance Ministry is taking care of the distribution of funds allocated by the Agriculture Ministry to the farmers to increase the production and productivity of rice, corn and soybean.
The finance ministry merely channeled the money under a regulation of the Directorate General of Treasury No Per-11/PB/2008 of May 2, 2008 on directives on the distribution of fund to the farmers for increasing the productivity and production of rice, corn, and soybean the implementation guidance on the channelling and payment of productivity and production fund for rice, corn and soybean through the integrated crops and resources management vocational school.
In supporting the government's program on the improvement of the productivity, production, and income of rice, corn and soybean growers, the agriculture ministry had allocated the funds.
The finance ministry confirmed that the amount of fund as specified in the list of budget for the projects, must not exceed the budget ceiling. 
Based on the fund allocation from the agriculture ministry, the officials in charge of making a commitment held a tender for the payment request letter SPP to officials who signed the payment order letter SPM. 
The tested SPP document also covered supporting SPP document, availability of budget ceiling in the budget project requirement list DIPA in order to assure that the claim should not exceed the budget ceiling, pursuant to a working plan and/or feasility of working results. 
The directorate general of treasury also disclosed that all provisions on procedures and requirements in applying for the SPP was arranged through a decree of the food crops director general of the agriculture ministry. 
The Islamic Development Bank IDB has promised to issue rupiah-denominated sharia bonds to finance its projects in Indonesia following the enactment of law on state sharia bonds SBSN in the country, an official said.
I met with the IDB president some time ago.
At that time he was waiting for the law on sharia bonds.
He told me that soon after the law had been enacted, they would issue rupiah-denominated bonds, Dewo Broto Joko Putranto, director of foreign multilateral funding at the Office of the State Minister for National Development Planning/National Development Planning Board Bappenas, said here on Wednesday.
The IDB had so far done the same thing in many Organization of Islamic Conference OIC member countries.
In Malaysia, they have issued ringgit-denominated sharia bonds, he said.
He said both domestic and foreign investors could bid for the rupiah-denominated sharia bonds.
They could be Middle Eastern investors who now have excessive liquid funds. 
Asked about the possibility of Indonesia obtaining program loans from the IDB, he said it was difficult to do so because the bank was facing solvency capital problems.
The government is planning to issue state sharia bonds worth Rp15 trillion this year.
Data from Bappenas show Indonesia has so far obtained project loans from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank ADB and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation JBIC as well as from other multilateral creditors, including the IDB.
The IDB's outstanding loans for Indonesia amounted to US$411.14 million for 17 projects as per December 31, 2007.
The rupiah in the Jakarta interbank spot market fell 10 points to Rp9,285/9,295 per dollar on Thursday evening from Rp9,285/9,300 per dollar on Wednesday.
Investors were less interested in buying up the dollar as street rallies against a government plan to raise fuel prices showed signs of abating, leading to a slight fall in the rupiah's exchange rate against the greenback, Kostaman Thayib, retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, said on Thursday.
He pointed out the strengthening of the regional stock exchange's index coupled with Bank Indonesia the central bank's plan to intervene in the market if the rupiah fell to Rp9,300 per dollar had eased negative pressure on the Indonesian currency.
We predict the rupiah will still be under pressure to hover above Rp9,300 per dollar on the ensuing day due to pressure from the global crude oil prices, he said.
The global crude oil prices currently stood at US$126 a barrel compared to US$127 a barrel previously, he said.
But he added the global crude prices might go up again and even hit an unprecedented level of US$200 a barrel because of high demand from the United States and China, the world's largest oil consumers.
As a crude oil exporter, Indonesia was supposed to enjoy windfall profit from the soaring global crude prices but the country was battling it out to plug a deficit in the state budget, he said.
Even the government was seeking foreign loans and planning to raise fuel oil prices by up to 30 percent to offset the budget deficit, he said.
The plan to raise fuel prices, if realized, would slow down economic growth because all sectors would be affected, he said.
The Indonesian economy in the first quarter of 2008 grew by 2.15 percent from the previous quarter and 6.28 percent from the same quarter last year, the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said.
The key driver of the quarterly growth was the agricultural sector which contributed 18.02 percent while that of the year-on-year growth was the transportation and telecommunication sector which contributed 19.7 percent, BPS Deputy Chief for Balance Sheet and Statiscical Analyses Slamet Sutomo said on Thursday.
Hence, the country's nominal gross domestic product GDP in the first quarter of 2008 was Rp1,126.8 trillion compared to Rp1,041.1 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2007, he said.
Compared to the previous quarter, the contribution of household consumption to the GDP in the first quarter of 2008 fell 0.4 percent, that of state consumption 30.5 percent and that of investment 0.6 percent, he said.
However, the export of goods and services which rose 5.7 percent gave positive contributions to the GDP, he said.
The drop in the household consumption's contribution to the GDP to 95.01 based on the consumer tendency index suggests that the consumer's economy is worsening.
Meanwhile, the government consumption was low as this budget year started a few months ago, he said.
The Finance Ministry has set the economic growth rate target for 2008 at 6 percent, or 0.3 percent lower than last year's 6.3 percent.
The rupiah rose three points to Rp9,313/9,315 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Monday as investors bought up the local unit, a foreign exchange analyst said.
The rupiah buyup is relatively small as investors are still waiting for a meeting of the group of eight G-8 industrialized nations expected to send a positive market sentiment, Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara said.
As previously expected, the rupiah which fell in the morning session would strengthen on Monday evening as the price correction was relatively small, he said.
But the rupiah buyup occurred ahead of the evening session so that it appreciated only slightly, he said.
The rupiah's appreciation was inseparable from Bank Indonesia the central bank's efforts to keep the Indonesian currency at the safe level of Rp9,300 per dollar, he said.
If the rupiah could be kept below Rp9,300 per dollar, it would be considered to be in the safest position, he said.
After all, it would be somewhat difficult for the rupiah to remain below Rp9,300 per dollar given the unpredictability of global market turbulences despite the absence of negative upheaval putting pressure on it, he said.
Slowly but surely, the rupiah would reach the level as it kept moving closer to Rp9,300 per dollar, he said. 
The Indonesian economy was also expected to pick up as reflected by investors' interest in investing in the domestic market, he said.
State mining company PT Antam Tbk and Jindal Stainless Limited have agreed to build a nickel and stainless steel smelter in Indonesia's Southeast Sulawesi province.
In its initial phase of operations the smelter will have an annual production capacity of 20,000 tons of nickel and 250,000 tons of steel, mostly high-quality stainless steel of the series 300, Antam President Director Dedi Adytia said on Tuesday.
He said the smelter would be 55 percent owned by Antam and 45 percent by Jindal.
Antam's contributions to the project would be expertise in nickel mining and processing as well as domestic knowledge and experience while Jindal's contributions would be stainless steel processing, marketing experience and global marketing networks.
The smelter would process nickel ore originating from Antam's mining concessions in Mandiodo.
The nickel ore was believed to have an average nickel content of 1.5 percent, he said.
He said the project would include a coal-fired power plant, water sanitation facility, port and housing complex.
The project would cost an estimated US$700 million, he said.
He said Antam and Jindal would soon set up a team to make preparations for the formation of a joint venture company to be called PT Antam Jindal Stainless Indonesia.
The project was part of Antam's business strategy to diversify its products, he said.
Bank Bukopin agreed at its general shareholders meeting on Thursday to pay out a cash dividend of Rp187.56 billion or Rp33.07 per share.
He said the dividend accounted for 50 percent of the bank's net profit of Rp365.13 billion last year.
At the meeting the management of the bank also reported the use of Rp269 billion in funds from the initial public offering IPO in the first half of 2007.
Of the total, Rp188.3 billion 70 percent was used for credit expansion, Rp44 billion 15 percent for network expansion, Rp26.9 billion 10 percent for hardware and software instruments, and Rp13.55 billion 5 percent for employees' training.
Indonesia's gross domestic product GDP is estimated to have grown by 6.2-6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2008, fueled by an increase in public spending and production, an official said.
Viewed from the high consumption side, our economic growth is still good, Secretary of the State Minister for National Development Planning/Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency Bappenas Syahrial Loetan said at the weekend.
The GDP projection which was higher than Bank Indonesia the central bank's forecast of 6.1 percent was also based on the assumption that the US recession and global slowdown had no significant impact on the Indonesian economy, he said.
It the impact will likely be noticeable only in the second quarter.
But we remain optimistic the GDP growth rate target of 6 percent can be achieved at the end of this year, he said.
Meanwhile, Bambang Prijambodo, director of macro planning at the Office of State Minister for National Development Planning/Bappenas, said the GDP forecast was also reflected by the high sales in the retail sector, cement expenditures, import of capital goods, an increase in consumption credits and investment, strong export growth, particularly the export of non-oil/gas commodities expected to grow by 24.8 percent.
Data from the agency show among the key drivers of rising public expenditures were the rise in motorcycle sales which increased by 36 percent from a year earlier, real index of retail sales in February which grew by 12 percent on a yearly basis and consumption credits which jumped by more than 200 percent from the first quarter of 2007.
The agency also noted investment rose by 2.2 percent, cement sales by 16.8 percent, import of capital goods by 102.5 percent, investment credits channeled by banks by up to Rp8.1 trillion, and credits channeled by banks as working capital by five folds from a year earlier.
On a yearly basis, export revenues rose by 31.4 percent and import revenues by 49 percent with non-oil/gas imports growing by 17.1 percent and the number of tourist arrivals to Indonesia rising by 15.7 percent from a year earlier.
The GDP growth of more than 6 percent indicated that the Indonesian economy was still promising amidst the current economic turbulence, Harry Azhar Aziz, deputy chairman of the House's budgetary committee, said.
But the growth is still worrying because it relies on the consumption sector that may expose it to inflationary pressures, he said.
The rupiah moved closer to Rp9,300 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Monday evening as investors were worried about the looming public opposition to the government's plan to raise fuel oil prices.
The public protests against the government's plan to raise fuel prices have prompted investors to buy up dollars and this caused the greenback to strengthen, money market observer Edwin Sinaga said on Monday.
The rupiah weakened by 20 points to Rp9,260/9,270 on Monday evening from Rp9,240/9,254 per dollar at the weekend.
The current crude price spiral was a global issue that was forcing almost all countries, including Indonesia, to raise their fuel prices, and, therefore, the government's plan to raise fuel prices early next month was inevitable, he said.
The increase in fuel oil prices would put pressure on the rupiah which was expected to hit Rp9,300 per dollar, he said.
We believe the rupiah will continue to drop.
But when it reaches a level of Rp9,300 per dollar, Bank Indonesia the central bank is likely to intervene in the money market to prevent it from depreciating further, he said.
He said the central bank had foreign exchange reserves large enough to keep the rupiah at a safe level.
The planned fuel oil price hikes would lead to a higher inflation rate that might prompt the central bank to raise again its key rate which currently stood at 8.25 percent, he said.
He predicted the money market would be sluggish in the next few days as investors tended to refrain from making transactions for fear of a massive rejection of the planned fuel price hikes.
The government believes the Indonesian economy will remain prospective in the next two years despite a global economic slowdown, a Finance Ministry official said.
The Indonesian economy will remain prospective in the 2008-2009 period in which it will expand by a range of 6-6.5 percent due to strong domestic demand and investment, Anggito Abimanyu, chief of the ministry's fiscal policy board BKF, said here on Wednesday.
The country's economic fundamentals would remain sound as reflected by Bank Indonesia the central bank's stable interest rate, the rupiah's stable exchange rate against the dollar and the rise in foreign exchange reserves, he said.
Realizing that the rise in food commodity prices would put pressure on inflation rate, the government would make every effort to prevent it from affecting the poor or the state budget, he said.
The soaring global crude prices which led to an increase in fuel subsidy had drawn the government's attention, he said.
The government was in the middle of formulating strategies to allocate fuel subsidy in a proper possible way, he said.
In addition, the government was also studying a number of options with regard to fuel subsidy to create fiscal balance, he said.
The government realized whatever policies it had taken in relation to fuel subsidy would not satisfy all sides, he said.
Under the uncertain economic conditions, fiscal responsibility should top the list of the country's priorities, he said.
If the strategy of adjusting fuel prices and compensating the poor for the rise in food prices was carried out properly, the vast majority of the Indonesian people would accept a change in fuel subsidy scheme and this would in the end raise the market's confidence in the Indonesian economy, he said.
Publicly-listed plantation company PT Bakrie Sumatra Plantations Tbk at its general shareholders meeting on Wednesday decided to pay out a dividend of Rp17 per share.
The total amount of dividends to be distributed is equal to 30 percent of the company's net profit totaling Rp206.6 billion in 2007.
The dividends will be paid out to shareholders on July 10, 2008 at the latest, the company's president director, Ambono Janurianto, said here Wednesday.
The meeting also decided to reappoint incumbent members of the board of directors with Ambono Janurianto as president director and increase the number of members of the board of commissioners by appointing former agriculture minister Bungaran Saragih.
Mining company PT Aneka Tambang Tbk Antam has temporarily ceased granite exploration operations on Piatu Hill in Kijang Bintan district, Riau Islands, after being officially informed the hill lies in a preserved forest area.
After receiving a Forestry Minister's circular issued in October 2007, we sent a letter on April 25 to our partner in the project, PT Mitra Investindo Tbk, to stop the explorations, Antam's corporate secretary, Bimo Budi Satriyo, said here Friday.
Bimo said the granite exploration area had become subject to a governmental investigation so continuing the exploration activity would make Antam as the concession-holder liable to legal sanctions.
PT Caraka later merged with PT Siwani Trimitra Tbk into a company which later became known as PT Mitra Investindo Tbk MITI while Antam's contract with PT Caraka was eventually taken over by MITI.
The exploration contract was valid from June 11, 2004 through June 10, 2009.
Now we are waiting for the result of the governmental investigation and the rechecking on the forest borders.
Therefore, the future of the ANTAM-MITI cooperation is still unclear.
Of course, we will adhere to the rules, Bimo said.
He said, the temporary cessation of exploration activity would not have a significant impact on the company's income as granite was not its core business.
Under the cooperation agreement, Antam would get a S$0,35 fee on every ton of granite mined. 
With a monthly granite production of 50,000 tons, the company would earn some S$17,500 per month or some S$210,000 per year from the granite mining venture.
The rupiah edged closer to Rp9,300 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Wednesday evening following a rush on the greenback prior to the government's decision to raise fuel prices. 
The on-going student rallies to protest against the planned fuel price hike worried investors so they bought up dollard, Kostaman Thayib, retail banking director of PT Bank Mega, said on Wednesday.
The rupiah weakened by 37 points to Rp9,295/9,310 per dollar on Wednesday from Rp9,258/9,277 the day before.
He predicted the rupiah was likely to weaken to more than Rp9,300 per dollar prompting Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI to intervene in the money market.
BI had foreign exchange reserves large enough to prevent the local unit from depreciating further, he said.
For the time being, the rupiah was under market pressure, he said adding the pressure would increase if global crude prices rose again.
Another pressure on the rupiah was the weak regional share market triggered by a drop in the Wall Street's index, he said. 
He said the government's plan to raise fuel prices by up to 30 percent would have a negative impact on economic growth which had been projected at 6 percent for this year.
The unfavorable condition would affect the people's purchasing power and consequently, many investors would invest their capital abroad, he said. 
The government plans to raise fuel prices in late May to ease pressure on the state budget from the upward trend in global crude prices.
Suzuki motor-vehicle producer PT Indomobil Suzuki Internasional said it had yet to lower its sales target in the face of the government's plan to raise fuel oil prices in June 2008.
Our sales target does not change.
Our targets for cars and motor-cycles are 80,000 units and 900,000 units respectively in 2008, PT Indomobil Suzuki Internasional President Director Subronto Laras said here on Wednesday.
He said during the first four months of 2008, when prices of basic necessaries were on the increase, demand for motor vehicles was still high.
There is exceptional demand.
Suzuki motorcycle sales reached 250,000 units, he said.
In spite of this fact, however, Subronto said his company would continue to anticipate various possibilities that could happen after fuel oil prices were hiked in June, 2008.
We will see the conditions first.
We can just take anticipative steps in the form of delaying the marketing of new brand like the 2,400 cc Grand Vitara which consumes fuel more wasteful then its previous generation, he said.
The same thing could also apply to 'matic scooter' motorcycle which is more two times fuel wasteful than that of the 'bebek' type, whose price is lower.
In the last two years, demand for 'matic' scooter motorcycles increased 25 percent of total Suzuki motorcycle sales.
This has caught our attention to see whether fuel oil price hikes would change the market's behavior, Subronto said.
He hoped that the impact of fuel oil price increases could well be anticipated because the current conditions were different from those when the government raised fuel oil prices in 2005.
At that time, sales dropped 40 percent.
The impact this year at least is expected on the industry, he added.
Prediction that this year the impact of fuel oil price hikes would not as worse as those in 2005 was also voiced by president director of Bank Mandiri, Agus Martowardojo. 
Because the price increase in 2005 was 100 percent, all sectors of businesses felt its impact, though world oil price at that time was only US$60 per barrel, he said.
Senior Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank Miranda S. Goeltom said she strongly believed the expected high inflation rate due to the increase in fuel oil prices can last for a shorter period than that in 2005. 
We strongly believe that if all government policies are in tandem with BI's policies, the duration of the high inflation rate as the impact of the increase in fuel oil prices can be shorthened, Miranda said here Thursday. 
She said the high inflation rate as the impact of the increase in fuel oil prices in 2005 by more than 100 percent abated only after three to four months. 
That the fuel oil price hike would indeed bring about a high annual inflation rate, but we believe this time the duration of the high inflation rate can be shortened compared with that in 2005, she said. 
Asked how big the impact of the 28.7 percent increase in the fuel oil prices on the inflation rate would be, Miranda said it would depend on the first effect only in terms of the increase in the fuel oil prices or the second effect.  
We should remember that monetary policies will not react to the current or past inflation rates but we react to the inflation expectation.
We will make the necessary policies to minimize the possible impacts in the future, she said.  
On the possibility of BI making tight monetary policies by increasing the interest rate, she said BI would make the necessary monetary policies, adding that the expected policies would depend on the latest information.  
We know that if the inflation rate continues to rise and the central bank gives no signal that it will be able to maintain the inflation rate well, it will have an impact on the economy, she said. 
She admitted that the latest information showed inflationary pressures would continue.
The high inflation rate in the world had yet to abate and the world's economic conditions were still uncertain.
We will take all variables into account before making a decision.
What the decision will be, just until next month, she said.   
The bond, the second of its kind to be issued this year, would carry a coupon of 10.375-10.875 percent payable every quarter, the company's president director, Wahzary Wardaya, said on Wednesday.
The company had appointed PT Danareksa Sekuritas, PT Citigroup Securities Indonesia and PT Trimegah Securities as bond issue underwriters, he said.
PT Danareksa posted a net profit of Rp98 billion last year.
In the first semester of 2007, the company's net profit jumped four-fold to Rp83 billion from the pevious semester thanks to a Rp219.4 billion increase in operational income.
Indonesia's monthly inflation rose 0.72 percent in July, bringing the calender inflation rate to 2.81 percent and the year-on-year inflation rate to 6.06 percent, Central Bureau of Statistics BPS chief Rusman Heriawan said on Wednesday.
But he added he believed the country could hit the full-year inflation target of 6 percent at the end of this year as the year-on-year inflation figure stood at 6.06 percent.
So, we are focusing on the year-on-year inflation rate which still reaches 6.06 percent.
If the patterns remain the same as in previous years when inflationary pressures occurred in September and October, we will certainly stick to the inflation target of 6 percent, he said.
The fairly high inflation rate was caused by annual patterns like in the previous year due to the start of the academic year and a significant increase in the prices of foodstuffs, he said.
The prices of foodstuffs contributed 1.35 percent and education, recreation and sports 2.89 percent to July's inflation rate, he said.
The annual cycle is educational costs as July is the start of academic year.
The monthly inflation rates in July 2006 and July 2005 were respectively 0.46 percent and 0.78 percent, he said.
The price of purebred chicken meat rose 8.86 percent due to limited supplies, contributing 0.13 percent to the monthly inflation rate, he said.
A 6.32 percent rise in the prices of egg and a 1.4 percent increase in the prices of fresh fish contributed 0.04 percent and 0.06 percent respectively to the inflation, he said.
Meanwhile, educational costs at the elementary school, junior high school and senior high school levels rose 10 percent, 8.4 percent and 4.5 percent respectively, adding another 0.07 percent, 0.05 percent and 0.04 percent to the overall rate, he said.
He predicted that educational costs would remain the source of inflation in August when the academic year for institutes of higher learning began.
July's inflation was also fueled by a 1.7 percent rise in the prices of cooking oil and a 8.5 percent increase in security costs which contributed 0.02 percent and 0.03 percent respectively to the overall rate, he said.
He said last month's core inflation rate clocked in at 0.71 percent, bringing the core calender inflation to 2.83 percent and the core year-on-year inflation to 5.75 percent.
Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI decided Thursday to keep its key rate at 8.25 percent for the third month in a row while still carefully considering the impact of the subprime mortgage turmoil despite the country's improving macro economic conditions and the rupiah's stable exchange rate. 
The meeting of Bank Indonesia's board of governors today decided to maintain the BI Rate at 8.25 percent after making a comprehensive evaluation of the prospects of the inflation rate in 2007, and projected economic developments where the impact of the sub prime mortgage turmoil is still felt, Budi Mulia, director of the central bank's strategic planning and public relations, said.
He said BI would keep monitoring the impact of the subprime mortgage turmoil and the possibility of the US economic slowdown affecting the Indonesian economy. 
The central bank was upbeat that the country could hit the full-year inflation target of 6, plus and minus 1, percent for this year, he said.
BI noted the consumer price index inflation in August rose to an on-year 6.51 percent from 6.06 percent a month earlier.
Meanwhile, the bank put core inflation which excludes volatile food prices and administered fuel prices, at a yearly 5.66 percent in August compared to 5.75 percent in the month before.
The increase in August's inflation was chiefly fueled by a rise in the prices of volatile foods with cooking oil, eggs and rice contributing the most to the inflation figure, he said.
He said BI also noted the increase in the administered prices of commodities such as kerosene contributed to last month's inflation. 
The central bank estimated the economy would expand 6.2 percent in the third quarter of 2007.
The growth will be driven by exports, private consumption and investment.
Investment will increase as a result of investors' optimism and financing support, he said. 
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Boediono said Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI's decision to cut its benchmark rate by another 25 basis points to 8.75 percent matches the country's current macro economic conditions.
It the interest rate policy is in line with the declining inflation rate, the rupiah's stable exchange rate, and the strong foreign investment inflows.
I think the policy is on the right track, he said following a limited cabinet meeting here on Thursday.
The drop in the key rate known as BI Rate was expected to lead to a positive sentiment which would eventually speed up the growth of the real sector, he said.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati expressed hope that the government-set inflation rate target of 6 percent for 2007 could be achieved, thereby it provided a leeway for the BI Rate to drop further.
However, she added the drop in the benchmark rate would still have no impact on the target of the deficit in the 2007 state budget as government spending would also increase.
Interest rate will fall and accordingly, interest spending and exchange rate for several instalments on foreign debts will drop.
But several spending will also increase, she said.
The House of Representatives DPR on Tuesday passed a bill on the third amendment to the 1983 law on general taxation arrangements and procedures into law.
Only the National Mandate Party PAN faction agreed to the passage of the bill into law with reservations.
Chief of the PAN faction Zulkifli Hasan said his faction had objections to the term 'taxpayer' which it said did not give equal treatment to tax officials, the creation of a tax-receiving agency to replace the Directorate General of Taxes, and the process of filing taxpayers' objections and appeals over tax assessments.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said she was fully aware of the faction's objections, adding the government was convinced that the process of filing objections and appeals over tax assessments would instead protect taxpayers' rights and ensure a sense of justice for taxpayers.
On the fear of potential losses, the government has made objective and careful calculations that no state receipts will be lost but the process may only lead to a delay in state receipts, she said.
Under the newly-amended law, taxpayers may have a small chance of applying for deferred tax payments by filing objections or appeals over tax assessments for fear that they would be subject to 50 percent fines if their objections were rejected and 100 percent fines if their appeals were turned down, she said.
On the faction's objection to the creation of a tax receiving agency, she said the government opined that the method of managing state receipts and expenditures still needed to be revised and hormonized as well as coordinated and improved administrative and operational procedures under one-stop service to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.
The minister said the term 'taxpayer' was not identical to tax depositor because the former covered tax withholder, tax collector and tax depositor.
A change in the term will have a fairly significant impact as the term 'taxpayer' is already widely known.
So, if we replace it with 'tax depositor' it will take a long time to popularize it, she said.
She agreed with the Golkar Party faction's proposal for the formation of a taxation committee as an independent supervisory institute responsible to the finance minister.
The government is aware of this view. 
Hopefully, the creation of this taxation supervisory commission will curb abuse and misappropriation of taxes withheld, she said. 
The Indonesian government has lowered its global oil price assumption in the revised 2007 state budget from US$63 to US$60 per barrel despite an upward trend in the global oil price.
Yes, that is the best thing to do.
Basically, what we have discussed in the revised state budget are the best throughout this year, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Boedino said after installing 21 second echelon officials here Wednesday.
He said global oil prices always fluctuated all the time so it was not easy to predict an annual average oil price.
We stick to the average price in the revised state budget for this year. 
About the realization, let's wait as we are still in the middle of the year, he said.
In lowering the global oil price assumption, he said the government had certainly considered oil subsidy, kerosene subsidy in particular.
The price of Indonesia's crude oil reached its lowest level early this year but moved up to US$69.14 a barrel in June 2007.
The Finance Ministry predicted the price of Indonesian crude in the global market averaged US$62.93 a barrel in the first half of 2007.
The average price of Indonesian crude is expected to reach US$58.6 a barrel in the second semester and US$60 a barrel throughout this year, or US$3 lower than the initial assumption of US$63 a barrel in the 2007 state budget.

Around 77 percent of the shares of Holcim which was previously known as Cibinong Cement are currently owned by Holdervin BV.
Foreign ownership of rupiah-denominated state bonds in June 2007 rose 47.6 percent to Rp81.78 trillion from Rp55.40 trillion in June 2006 but fell 2 percent from Rp83.48 trillion in May 2007, the Finance Ministry said.

In addition, many new gas subscribers were still unable to use gas optimally according to their contracts, he said.
The low gas consumption was also partly caused by the distribution pipelines which are now under the process of completion, he said.
Actually, the gas supplies from the Pagardewa field to the South Sumatra-West Java pipelines reached 130 mmscfd in August 2007 but the customers' gas consumption only averaged 104 mmscfd, he said.

?PT Antam plans to buy back its shares from the capital market and a team has been appointed to study it.
We indeed plan to conduct a buyback but we do not know how many shares we would buy back and at what price. 
Let us just wait for the result of the study which is expected to finish by the end of November, its president director, Alwin Syah Loebis, said here on Tuesday. 
Alwin said after the study was finished the company would ask for an approval from the shareholders through a shareholders general meeting. 
When asked if the company had asked for an approval from the state minister for state-owned firms he said net yet.
We will discuss it with the minister later, he said.
As it is generally known the price of Antam shares at the capital market has continued to drop in the past six months in line with the decreasing price of nickel which is the main product of the company.
In the first semester this year the company's net profit also dropped by more than 40 percent.
In the trading on Tuesday the price of Antam shares was closed at Rp1,050 per share or up Rp30 per share. 
In the morning trading the shares were traded at Rp910 per share.
He said when the price of Antam shares were declining while it stood at Rp1,800 per share, the management had already planned to conduct a buyback. 
At the time however we just embarked on a serious step towards it.
Regarding the funds for the plan, Alwin declined to elaborate telling only 
what is clear is we have internal funds totalling US$360 million.
Meanwhile now is actually the time for the company to do it. 
Indeed the price of the Antam shares is now low but to buy them back we still need to conduct a study and an approval from the shareholders, he said.
PT Indofood Sukses Makmur INDF has bought 100 percent of Drayton Pte Ltd Drayton's shares, including Drayton shareholders' claims amounting to US$ 100.5 million, an INDF spokesperson said. 
On September 22,2008 , INDF signed a conditional sales-and- purchase agreement with Pastila Investment Limited on 100 percent of Drayton's shares , including US$ 100.5 million worth of shareholders' claims, Marianty Setiawan, INDF's corporate secretary, said here Tuesday.
She said Drayton was a Singaporean company controlling 68.57 percent of Indolakto shares which would be acquired by INDF. 
Indolakto was a producer of milk and milk products circulating in Indonesian markets under such brand names as Indomilk, Cap Enaak, Tiga Sapi, Orchid Butter and Indoeskrim.
The transaction to acquire Indolakto was valued at US$ 350 million of which 15 percent US$52,5 million would be paid at the signing of the purchase agreement and the rest US$297.5 million on the settlement date which would be seven days after fulfillment of all acquisition terms.
Setiawan said the funds for the acquisition would come from internal sources and a bank loan. 
We plan to complete the acquisition process in December 2008, she said.
She also said the transaction was a material one and thus it had to be approved by an INDF extraordinary general shareholders' meeting. 
Director General of Debt Management at the Finance Ministry Rahmat Waluyanto said here Wednesday Indonesia still had good chances to get soft loans from several countries to overcome its State Budget deficit.
As long as we have good programs to be sponsored such as poverty reduction, corruption eradication, climate change, education, and health, I believe many parties will be interested to help Indonesia by giving soft loans with milder terms and conditions said Rahmat at the finance ministry building.
For example, he said, France, through the French Development Agency AFD, had this year given loans to the Regional Budgets APBDs through the climate change program.
Indonesia itself had a policy matrix in relation to the program so that the AFD gave soft loan commitments amounting to US$ 200 million. 
The authorities had been proposing an addition of another US$100 million so that this year's loan could be US$300 million. 
This is beyond our own estimates, he said.
Rahmat also said several parties such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation JBIC, Germany, Italy, and England were also still interested to give financial aid to Indonesia.
They are still interested although they may give the assistance in the form of swap deals instead of loans.
Therefore, I think we still have good prospects to fund our State Budget, he said.
State Enterprises Minister Sofyan Djalil said the government would complete the divestment of 82.7 percent of the shares of Bank Indonesia the central bank in PT Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia before the end of this year.
The divestment of Bank Indonesia BI shares in Bahana must be accomplished this year so that BI, in line with the law, will no longer have shares in the company, Djalil said at his office.
He said negotiations on the matter were still continuing with two options on offer, namely selling the shares to the government and/or giving them to the government as a grant.
The settlement of the problem also depends on the financial condition of PT Bahana, he said.
According to records PT Bahana is now facing financial difficulties because of its debt to the government totaling Rp369.4 billion and US$98 million.
The company had asked for the restructuring several times including asking to set-off its Investment Fund Account debt with compensation funds.
PT Bahana received a loan from the government's Investment Fund Account on December 16, 1998 totaling Rp250 billion. 
When it was due the company failed to pay the principal, interest and fines due.
Djalil said the essence of the problem was releasing the BI shares because in line with the law the central bank had to release its ownership in sister companies that were not in line with the bank's tasks.
BI wants to respect the law and the BI law also states that the problem has to be settled before 2009, he said.
The minister said the question whether the shares would be sold or presented to the government as as grant was now still being worked out.
The BI governor has sent a letter to the finance minister telling that in principle BI would release its ownership in Bahana. 
So there has not yet been any agreement, he said.
Regarding the possibility of BI choosing to sell the shares to the government, he said the government does not have the money for it. 
Publicly listed property firm PT Bakrieland Development Tbk ELTY is seeking to issue share bonds sukuk worth Rp200 billion-Rp300 billion next year to finance a number of its city property projects.
It is true that we plan to issue sharia bonds. 
The plan is still under consideration, ELTY President Director Hiramsyah S. Thaib said here on Friday.
He said the value of the sharia bonds would not be as high as that of the conventional bonds the company issued some time ago.
In March 2008, the company issued two types of conventional bonds worth Rp500 billion payable in three years and five years each.
He said the company would use proceeds from the planned issuance of sharia bonds to finance a number of projects including Bogor Nirwana Residence BNR, Ijen Nirwana Residence in Malang, East Java, and Batam Nirwana Residence in Batam.
Through the cooperation, ELTY would sell stakes in its subsidiaries to the foreign investors, he said.
In the first phase, the company planned to sell a 30 percent stake in its subsidiary carrying out the BNR project in Bogor, West Java, he said.
The rupiah strengthened to Rp9,385/9,390 against the US dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Friday morning after investors bought the local unit on signals Bank Indonesia BI will extend repurchase agreement repo facilities.
The central bank has hinted it will extend three-month repo facilities to make them more attractive to curb tight market liquidity.
Foreign exchange analyst Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk said market liquidity pressure had gradually faded following the central bank's plan to extend the repo facilities.
We are optimistic local investors will still eye the rupiah until this evening so that it will leave the level of Rp9,400 per dollar far behind, he said.
It was still rather difficult for the rupiah to further appreciate as investors were focusing their attention on the US greenback's strengthening in the global market despite worries about the US economic growth, he said.
The Indonesian currency tumbled to nearly Rp9,500 per dollar in recent weeks due in part to a financial crisis in the US and Europe prompting foreign investors to buy up the dollar, he said.
The dollar is strengthening amidst investors' worries about continued financial turmoil in the US.
The euro fell to 1.4348 from 1.4323 against the dollar. 
The US greenback also appreciated agaiunst the yen to 105.37 from 104.56 previously.
Three of five coal mining companies which the government recently reprimanded for failing to pay royalties for many years were on Friday reported to have honored their obligations. 
Soepomo, the finance ministry's director of multifarious state wealth, said here Friday the companies that had fulfilled their royatly paying obligations were PT Kideco Jaya Agung Rp110 billion, PT Adaro Indonesia Rp150 billion and PT Berau Coal Rp90 billion.
Kideco and Adaro made the payment yesterday and Berau Coal this afternoon, Soepomo said.
Kideco, Adaro and Berau were among five coal companies that had previously refused to pay the royalties on the ground the government had yet to disburse tax restitutions to which they were entitled. 
But the government had told the companies the royalties issue was not linked to the tax restitution problem and therefore they were expected to pay the royalties as soon as possible. 
The government had also said it would try to solve both problems at the same time by asking the companies to pay a warranty of Rp600 billion and the Development Finances ComptrollerBPKP to conduct audits on the royalties and tax restitution claims. 
The two other coal companies owing royalties to the government --- PT Kaltim Prima Coal KPC and PT Arutmin -- had already promised to meet their obligations, Soepomo said. 
Soepomo declined to answer when asked what the government would do if the two companies had not paid the royallties by September 19.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said Friday the current global liquidity crisis has only led to a 0.1 percent drop in Indonesia's gross domestic product GDP. 
Indonesia is one of the Asian countries recording the lowest declines in GDP, he told the press after Friday prayers at his office here.
The decline in Indonesia's GDP to 6.3 percent from 6.4 percent previously was not sharp compared to the economic setbacks in the United States, European countries, Japan, China, India and Thailand which were all directly affected by the liquidity crisis, he said.
As the largest exporting country, China saw a 2 percent drop in its GDP, he said.
The global liquidity crisis was having a small impact on Indonesia's GDP because, unlike many developed nations, Indonesia had not placed capital in US financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers and AIG, he said.
He added, however, the liquidity crisis would reduce US investment in Indonesia and depress the prices of Indonesia's exports to the US.
Commenting on the fall in global crude prices, the vice president said he could as yet not say whether it would have an impact on the fuel subsidy provided for in the 2008 state budget. 
The global crude prices are still fluctuating above US$100 per barrel Last night they fell to US$97 a barrel. 
Meanwhile, the assumed oil price in the state budget is based on the average crude price. 
In addition, the amount of oil subsidy set in the state budget is Rp150 trillion, he said.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said 12 of the country's 33 provinces in the first half of 2008 recorded a higher-than-national economic growth rate of 6.4 percent.
The regional economic growth is one of the yardsticks for the success of the national economic development, the president said in his address on the government's explanations on regional development policies at the plenary session of the Regional Representative Council DPD here on Friday.
Even some of the provinces including Riau Islands, Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan and Central Sulawesi saw an economic growth rate of more than 8.5 percent, he said.
The achievement is worthy of praise. 
I hope that the provinces can maintain the achievement, he said.
Viewed from even distribution, the regional economic growth in the past four years was also encouraging, he said.
In 2002, the even distribution index stood at 0.72 and fell to 0.56 in 2007, he said.
The drop in the index suggested that economic activities among provinces in the country had increasingly become balanced, he said.
It is the common responsibility of us, either at a central or regional level, to always maintain the synergy of national development in order to be able to create fair economic conditions, he said. 
Bank Indonesia BI Governor Boediono said on Friday the rupiah is weakening against the US dollar because of a global phenomenon in which the greenback is strengthening against almost all other world currencies.
So this is a market movement. 
I think there is no problem when it comes to fundamentals, he said.
The dollar was strengthening against other world currencies as many perceived the US economy would perform better than those of the rest of the world, he said.
The BI governor said the rupiah's fall on Friday which was higher than any other countries' constituted a change in the rupiah's appreciation over the past few weeks.
This is because over the past few weeks the rupiah strengthened at a higher pace than any other currency, he said.
The central bank would always monitor the money market to stabilize the rupiah's exchange rate, he said.
We will remain in the money market to reduce the money market's volatility, he said.
The rupiah plunged to Rp9,350 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market late Friday as demand for the US greenback kept rising throughout the day.
Demand for the dollar rose due to a fall in global crude prices to US$107 per barrel, causing the rupiah to plunge, Retail Banking Director of PT Bank Mega Tbk. Kostaman Thayib said here Friday.
The negative market upheaval would prompt the rupiah to fall to up to Rp9,400 per dollar, he said.
We believe the rupiah will fall to nearly Rp9,400 per dollar, he said.
He said Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI would likely intervene in the money market to prevent the local unit from falling further.
BI would release funds from its foreign exchange reserves. 
Otherwise, it would be difficult to control the rupiah's continuing fall, he said.
From the standpoint of economic fundamentals, the government did not have any problem. 
With the recent drop in global crude prices, the economy would grow at a faster pace, he said.
We believe the rupiah is falling because of panic in the market following a drop in global crude prices, he said.
Market pressures grew stronger after fund managers released their shares in the capital market and bought the US greenback to offset the losses they had suffered.
BI has raised its benchmark interest rate to 9.25 percent from 9 percent previously to curb the accelerating inflation rate expected to reach 12 percent this year, he said.
Actually, the rise in the key rate had nothing to do with the rupiah's depreciation. 
The Indonesian currency fell due to an outflow of foreign capital, he said.
The Indonesian government should change its foreign exchange reserve management system to improve the country's competitive edge and productivity and enable it to withstand global economic turmoils, an economist said.
Executive Director of the Econit Economic Research Institute Henri Saparini was responding to the country's economic capability in the face of the looming economic slowdown in the United States and Europe and the rupiah's continuous weakening against the US dollar.
According to Bank Indonesia BI, the country's foreign exchange reserves in the month ended on August 31, 2008 stood at US$58.4 billion, down nearly 2 percent from a month earlier.
The central bank said the government's efforts to stabilize the rupiah and repay debts and global pressure due to economic slowdown and accelerating inflation were responsible for the drop in the foreign exchange reserves.
Henri said the country's foreign exchange reserves did not reflect the real conditions because they were driven by hot money, particularly an inflow of foreign funds as a result of soaring commodity prices in the global market and proceeds from the issuance of state bonds.
The government wants to prevent an outflow of the funds by raising the benchmark interest rate BI Rate to curb the stubbornly high inflation rates at the expense of the real sector's growth, he said.
Because of the higher lending rates, the business world must spend more on their operations and consequently, the real sector was growing at a slow pace, he said.
To cope with inflationary pressures, the government had since 2007 been using monetary approaches by raising the BI Rate. 
However, the inflation rates surpassed the target and could not be curbed, he said.
To curb inflation, we can just control the prices of goods and services as well as the distribution of goods, he said.
The government estimates the deficit in the 2008 state budget will be lower than 1.9 percent of the country's gross domestic product GDP due in part to a recent drop in global crude prices.
The drop in global crude prices coupled with a rise in the rupiah's exchange rate will have a good impact on state revenues in rupiah, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said here on Friday night.
She said the drop in global crude prices would have a positive impact on the state budget in that it would reduce the country's oil subsidy.
So the 2008 state budget deficit will possibly not be as high as 2.1 percent or 1.9 percent of GDP, she said.
The minister said the drop in global crude prices and the rise in state receipts in rupiah laid a basis for the 2008 state budget to remain secure until the end of this year.
With the higher state receipts in rupiah, the Directorate General of Debt Managment does not need to issue state debentures in larger amounts, she said.
In the revised 2008 state budget, the government had set the budget deficit at 2.1 percent of GDP or Rp94.3 trillion with state expenditures estimated at Rp989.3 trillion and state revenues and grants at Rp895 trillion.
The revised 2008 state budget also set the assumed economic growth rate at 6.4 percent, on-year inflation rate at 6.5 percent, interest on Bank Indonesia short-term promissory notes for three-month deposits at 7.5 percent, the rupiah's exchange rate against the dollar at Rp9,100, oil price at US$95 per barrel and oil production at 927,000 barrels per day.
But in its midyearly report delivered to the House of Representatives DPR, the government projected the 2008 budget deficit at 1.9 percent of GDP or Rp90.55 trillion with state expenditures estimated at Rp1,097.60 trillion and state revenues and grants at Rp1,007.05 trillion.
Publicly-listed oil company PT Energi Mega Persada Tbk ENRG has secured US$450 million in loans from Credit Suisse to repay its maturing debts, expand investment and strengthen its working capital.
We got the loans through our subsidiary, EMP Holdings Singapore Pte Ltd, ENRG President Director Christian V Ponto said in a press statement on Tuesday.
The remaining US$189.25 million would be used to finance the company's exploration activities and strengthen its working capital, he said.
We believe the loans are enough to settle all of our maturing debts and expedite production, he said.
He said the company's ratio of net debts to equities rose to 88 percent from 69 percent in the first semester of 2008. 
The figure is considered too low and can be well overcome, he said.
ENGR saw a 100 percent surge in its sales to Rp889 billion in the first half of 2008 from Rp444.19 billion in the same period last year on the back of a 65 percent rise in oil price to US$104 a barrel and a rise in oil and gas production to 24,600 ton a day from 24,400 tons a day.
After all, the company's net profit in the first semester of 2008 fell 40.97 percent to Rp77 billion from Rp130.5 billion a year earlier.
PT Charoen Pokphand Indonesia expects its net profit this year to reach Rp450 billion.
The company's vice president director, Thomas Effendy, said at a fast-breaking gathering here on Tuesday evening the profit was expected to come from production and sale price increases.
He said the figures were obtained from production of animal feed that would reach two million tons, day-old chickens 480 million and processed chickens 28,000 tons.
This year we plan to produce 2.3 million tons of animal feed while production of day old chickens is expected to rise 10 percent to around 528 millions. 
Processing chickens meanwhile will grow the highest or more than 50 percent every year. 
We are expecting production of processing chickens this year is around 42,000 tons, he said.
The animal feed producer has increased the capacity of its feedmills in Makassar and Lampung and expanded its breeding farm.
The project of increasing the capacity of two feedmills in Makassar and Lampung has been completed and the mills are already operating, he said.
Thomas hoped the rise in sales prices would help the achievement of the net profit target. 
The price of animal feed at present is around Rp3,000 per kilogram. 
Last year it was only around Rp2,000 per kilogram. 
The price of day-old chickens this year has risen to around Rp3,000 per head, he said.
With these factors in mind, he said, he hoped the company's consolidated earnings would reach Rp12 trillion this year or rise by 40 percent from Rp8.7 trillion last year.
PT Aneka Tambang Tbk Antam will reduce in stages its dependence on nickel for its income and will start diversifying its industrial activity among others to coal mining, a company spokesman said.
At present, around 78 percent of our income is contributed by nickel products. In stages, we will reduce our dependence on nickel and next year we will have reduced it to 75 percent, Antam president director Alwin Syah Loebis said here on Tuesday night.
He said the price of several commodities including nickel had slumped because of the current turmoil in global stock markets. 
The price of nickel at present was US$8.5 per pound which was burdensome to Antam although it was predicted to reach US$9 to US$10 per pound by the end of this year, he said.
In the first semester of this year the price enjoyed by Antam nickel was around Rp12.55 per pound or down 21.46 percent from the same period last year, he said.
To overcome the situation, he said, the company's management had to think hard. To assure its income it would take two big steps namely cutting up to 10 percent from the budgeted level the cost of production until the end of this year, he said.
This is really hard to do but we will do our best. 
The second step meanwhile is increasing producion of ferronickel from currently 17,000 tons to 18,000 tons. 
The aim is to maintain Antam's performance. Hopefully the price of nickel will not drop further, he said.
He said Antam also suffered from the drop in the price of gold. 
Because of the bad market condition Antam would focus on only two projects, namely its Alumina Tayan and Pomala coal-fired power plant projects. 
In the Alumina Tayan project Antam would invest a total of around US$500 million. 
Antam would hold 65 percent of Alumina Tayan shares while the rest would belong to a Japanese investor.
He said Antam expected to pay its entire equity contribution early next year so that the project could reach operational state by the end of 2009.
Antam's investment in a coal-fired power plant in Pomala would be around US$300 million. The financing of the project was expected to be settled in 2009 so that it could start operating in 2010, he said.
If we produce more than is needed by the Pomala power plant, we will possibly sell the excess coal, he said
Bank Mandiri BMRI, the largest state-owned bank in terms of assets, has raised the ceiling of the non-cash loan NCL facility it has granted to cement maker PT Semen Padang to Rp150 billion from Rp75 billion previously, BMRI President Director Agus Martowardojo said. 
Apart from raising the ceiling of the NCL facility, BMRI was also ready to provide Rp260 billion in funds for PT Semen Padang distributors to finance their bank guarantees and credit needs, Martowardojo said in a press statement issued here on Thursday. 
BMRI will also provide Sub Limit Trust Receipt credits amounting to 50 percent of the NCL ceiling or Rp75 billion. 
We believe that Semen Padang has the capability to return the loans as the company has shown its good reputation and financial performance, so that a Sub Limit Trust Receipt is very relevant and will support PT Semen Padang's cash flow management, he said. 
Meanwhile, PT Semen Padang President Director E Irzal said his company was currently meeting 14 percent of the national demand for cement and 48 percent of Sumatra's need for cement. 
The Central Bureau of Statistics BPS said it will announce the September 2008 inflation rate on October 6, 2008 as the post fasting month festivities is to fall on October 1-2, 2008.
BPS Head Rusman Heriawan said here on Friday the September inflation rate would be calculated based on economic activities during the month.
On September 30, all transactions in the runup to the Idul Fitri holidays could record extraordinary developments, he said.
Although it would be announced on October 6, or five days later than usual, no data on the month's inflation would be leaked, the BPS chairman said.
We will also put the inflation rate in our website considering the fact that our data are also needed by people overseas, he added.
The president director of PT Bank Bukopin, Glen Glenardi, said here on Monday that Rabobank was one of the parties that had expressed interest in buying Bukopin shares.
Rabobank is one of the interested investors, but it has not decided how much it would buy as it is still scrutinizing the single presence policy, he said after a fast-breaking gathering.
He said Rabobank has already had shares in Bank Hagakita but it still had an interest in owning Bank Bukopin shares.
He said besides Rabobank there were also other investors who were interested in joining the company. 
Many parties are interested, but they want to be majority shareholders, he said.
The bank's shareholders, meanwhile, Glen said, were expected to be able to increase the composition of their shares in stages and in terms of business recording progress.
The president director said the parties interested in buying Bukopin shares include a European consortium and foreign investors who wished to make the purchases through local securities market and others.
The House of Representatives DPR and the government agreed Thursday to a 20 percent cut in 2009 fuel subsidy to Rp100.6 trillion from a year earlier following a drop in global crude prices.
Fuel consumption in 2009 was projected at 36.9 million kiloliters, up 3 percent from 35.6 million kiloliters quoted in the revised 2008 state budget, the coordinator of the House's working committee for assumptions in the draft 2009 state budget, Harry Azhar Azis, said.
The fuel subsidy is for 19.4 million kiloliters of premium grade gasoline, 5.8 million kiloliters of kerosene, 11.6 million kiloliters of diesel oil, and gas equivalent to 4 million kiloliters of kerosene under the kerosene-to-gas conversion program, he said.
Electricity subsidy is still being discussed by the committee, he said.
Earlier, the committee also agreed to the assumed oil production of 960,000 barrels per day for 2009.
Vice president director of state cement maker PT Semen Gresik, Heru P Adiningrat, said here Thursday the company would need around US$300 million next year in connection with its plan to build new factories.
So it will be around US$300 million, he said during a fast-breaking gathering.
He said the need could be met by banks or other sources. 
We will take the one which most favorable, he said.
He said this year the investment fund could still be sought from internal funds. 
This year the internal funds are still sufficient for such purpose, but we will need bigger funds in the second quarter next year and it is only then that we will seek bank loans or funds from other sources depending on which one is most favorable, he said.
Regarding the idea of issuing global bonds he said that the plan still stands, awaiting the right time.
We still want to see a good condition of the macro-economic situation in the country We have also appointed an underwriter, JP Morgan, he said.
The company in the next four years needs an investment of US$1.2 to 1.6 billion to be used for building two new cement factories and 10 power plants.
He said the two factories to be set up in Java and Sulawesi would have a cement capacity production of 2.5 million tons a year each.
For the building of the factories the company would need up to US$675 million while for the 10 power plants US$573 million until 2011.
The power plants will be built in several location
State-owned Bank Negara Indonesia BNI, the country's third largest lender, will soon raise its lending rate by 1 percent due to tight liquidity funds and a rise in its cost of funds after Bank Indonesia BI raised its key rate by 0.25 basis points to 9.25 percent early this month.
BI has several times raised its key rate. And this time we are making an adjustment by raising it the lending rate by 1 percent due to a rise in cost of funds, BNI President Director Gatot M Suwondo said on Thursday night.
The rise in lending rate would also apply to disbursed loans, including credits worth US$100 million to finance the construction of power plants with a combined capacity of 10,000 megawatts, he said. 
The government will reduce the amount of state debentures SUN following tight liquidity in the market this year, a finance ministry official said.
In the face of tight liquidity in the market, the government while standing-by will take a number of steps such as reducing the amount of state debentures, Anggito Abimanyu, head of fiscal monetary affairs at the Ministry of Finance, said here on Monday.
He said the amount of state debentures which initially was estimated to reach 1.7 percent of gross domestic product Rp117 trillion would be reduced.
So we will reduce their amount, he said.
The government would also revise the structure of its balance of payments BOP. Actually the structure of our BOP is not as bad as people think. It is much better than expected, he added.
Anggito said the decline in the oil price in the world market would help the government and Bank Indonesia BI/central bank stabilize the market and make liquidity less tight.
What is important is that the government's steps are intended to stabilize the market and loosen up liquidity in the market, he said.
PT Intikeramik Indonesia Asosiasi Tbk KIAS obtained a Rp125 billion loan from PT Clipan Finance Indonesia Tbk CFIN for the settlement of a promissory note of Faringtion Inc and Concept Link. Ltd. 
We have signed a new loan agreement with Clipan Finance, said KIAS president director, Rica Susilo, Monday.
Rico said the loan was given with a 17 percent annual interest rate calculated daily. 
The loan covering a period of 12 months can be extended. 
The new loan is guaranteed with all the firm's assets, as agreed on in an extraordinary shareholders general meeting on May 12 2008
The realization of customs tax receipt until September 2 this year has reached Rp33.65 trillion or about 73.61 percent of the target set at Rp45.72 trillion in the revised 2008 state budget.
According to the Online Report Module of the Customs and Excise Office here on Tuesday, import duty receipt in that period also reached Rp14.80 trillion or about 93.55 percent of the target set in the state budget at Rp15.82 trillion.
In the meantime, the realization of export tax revenues has also reached Rp12.52 trillion or about 112.24 percent of the target set at Rp11.16 trillion in the state budget.
Thus, the total state revenues the Customs and Exercise Office has collected until September 2, 2008 accounted for Rp60.97 trillion while the revised 2008 state budget has set a total of Rp74.70 trillion.
The rupiah tumbled to US$9,465/9,470 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Tuesday morning from Rp9,453/Rp9,536 per dollar the day before, a foreign exchange analyst said.
The rupiah came under constant pressure, causing it to tumble again on Tuesday, Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk said on Tuesday.
If the condition continued, the Indonesian currency might edge closer to Rp9,500 per dollar, he said.
The rupiah would further depreciate against the dollar if Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI did not intervene in the money market and left its trading to the market mechanism, he said.
Bank Indonesia will likely intervene in the market if the market pressure is getting stronger and causes the rupiah to move closer to Rp9,500 per dollar, he said. 
He said the central bank would prevent the local unit from hitting a psychological level of Rp9,500 per dollar which many feared would cause the rupiah to plunge further.
It was a matter of time for Bank Indonesia to intervene in the money market, he said.
The government is still undecided about raising excise tariff for the 2009 draft state budget, a minister said.
When it comes to excise tariff for the 2009 draft state budget, we will go ahead with the existing policy, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Thursday.
The government would not make radical changes in excise tariff next year as proposed by many quarters, she said.
Earlier, the Demographic Institute of the School of Economics at the University of Indonesia LDFEUI proposed that the government raise the target of state revenues from tobacco excise to the maximum limit as permitted by the excise law.
LDFEUI suggested that state revenues from tobacco excise be raised by a range of Rp29.1 trillion to Rp59.3 trillion to increase the health of the people and support the state budget.
The minister said she had communicated the government's short-term policy in the excise sector to the stakeholders as well as to relevant government agencies such as the industry ministry, the manpower and transmigration ministry and the health ministry.
The government has set the excise revenue target at Rp47.49 trillion for 2009 compared to Rp45.72 trillion a year earlier.
The rupiah strengthened to Rp9,300 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market late Monday as investors bought the local unit on signals that Bank Indonesia BI will extend repurchase agreement repo facilities.
Bank Indonesia's plan to extend repo facilities and the government's wish to put its funds in the central bank to boost banking liquidity had caused the rupiah to strengthen, foreign exchange analyst Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk said on Monday.
The Indonesian currency closed at Rp9,300/9,305 per dollar late Monday compared to Rp9,313/9,380 per dollar at the weekend, up 13 points.
He said the US government had also injected US$700 billion in fresh funds to overcome a financial crisis that affected the country.
The US was trying to overcome the financial crisis after a number of large-scale US companies had gone bankrupt, he said.
The rupiah had earlier edged closer to Rp9,080 per dollar before it closed at Rp9,300/9,305 per dollar.
Rully said the rupiah still had room to strengthen again as BI would always try to keep the local unit's liquidity using all its available instruments though the global economic turbulence had shown on sign of abating.
It was likely BI would raise again its benchmark interest rate to curb the stubbornly high inflation rate, he said.
China announced Monday its first cut in lending rates since 2002, the strongest indication yet that it is becoming concerned about the need to spur growth.
The government has decided to cut the benchmark one-year lending rate by 27 basis points to 7.20 percent with effect from Tuesday, while keeping the deposit rate stable, the central bank said in a statement.
China's government has indicated in recent weeks that spurring growth has become a priority, in a major shift from a more pronounced emphasis on inflation control early this year.
The Politburo reached that consensus against the backdrop of new data showing China's economic growth slowed to 10.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 by contrast, the economy grew by 11.9 percent in the whole of 2007.
However, the nation's largest and most cash-rich banks were not covered by the reserve ratio cut, indicating monetary authorities were keen not to flood the market with liquidity.
By contrast, the required reserve ratio will be slashed by two percentage points for local financial institutions in areas devastated by the May earthquake in southwest China's Sichuan province.
Indonesia's economy will still grow more than six percent despite the current financial market crisis, Sunarsip, an observer from the Indonesia Economic Intelligence, said here on Monday.
Although the capital market has slumped and the rupiah is under pressure our economy will remain to grow past six percent because our economic growth is driven more by internal and not external factors, he said.
He said the country's economy still grew 6.39 percent in the first semester of this year despite the world economic slowdown.
Strong domestic demand as reflected by credit growth, reaching 35 to 37 percent, will certainly boost economic growth, he said.
In view of that he believed the country's economic growth would reach 6.3 percent. 
moreover strong demand is still continuing, he said.
He said current fluctuations in the domestic financial market were driven more by external factors.
referring to the collapse of huge companies in the US such as the Lehman Brothers and City Corp before. 
He said the collapse had caused financial market upheavals in various countries including Indonesia.
I think the impact on the financial market will remain in the next two months, he said.
On inflation he said it was predicted it could reach 12 percent. 
Inflation this year will remain high but is still tolerable in view of current economic condition, he said.
The Asian Development Bank ADB and the Islamic Development Bank IDB have signed a co-financing agreement to raise up to US$4 billion in fresh funds to finance projects in a number of member states, including Indonesia in the next three years.
Under the agreement, the two international institutions will make available US$2 billion each for the projects, the ADB said in its official website on Tuesday.
The agreement would focus on financing infrastructure projects covering irrigation and urban sectors. 
In a number of certain countries, the education, health, etc sectors may have a chance of securing financing from the agreement.
The agreement is in line with the Accra Summit and other international declarations within the frame of building development effectiveness and harmony, IDB Vice President Amadou Cisse said.
In addition, the agreement would also make it possible for the adoption of a new platform in which the two institutions could raise third party funds from investors in other member states, ADB Director General for Central and West Asia Juan Miranda said.
The agreement is consistent with the ADB's 2020 strategy and the IDB's 1440 Hijrah vision, IDB Director for Asia Walid Abdelwahab said.
State-owned tin mining company PT Timah has canceled a plan to acquire a mining business in Australia because it is no longer profitable.
The Australian mining field is an old mining site which had been abandoned for a long time with a remaining tin reserve of about 11,000 million tons.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani stated that the total dividends put in by state-own enterprises BUMN during the first semester of pf2008 had reached Rp13.5 trillion from its target of Rp31.2 trillion in 2008 state budget as reported here Tuesday.
The number was a contribution from the bank and non-bank sectors respectively Rp4.5 trillion and Rp8.9 trillion.
The state oil and gas company PT Pertamina has not raised the numbers since it is still being calculated, she said.
The contribution from the banks has exceeded the initial target of Rp3.87 quintillion and the global fluctuation should be taken into consideration for the banks to prepare the careful risk management.
PT Semen Gresik Tbk estimates its income by the end of this year will reach Rp11 trillion or up by 15 percent from around Rp9.5 trillion last year, the company's chief said.
In the second semester of this year, demand has been low but it is expected to rise again in September and remain high until year end, the company's president director, Dwi Sutjipto, said here on Tuesday.
Accordingly, the company hoped its net profit this year would at least be the same as last year, he said.
Dwi said the company's financial performance depended much on demand and cement price movements in the market.
Referring as an example to the situation in August when national demand dropped around two percent compared to the same period last year.
However, this is not a problem because the target of the first semester has already been surpassed, he said.
Dwi said the company's rising income until the end of this year would probably be the result of an increase in demand from 34 million tons in 2007 to 37 million tons.
It was even predicted cement consumption would increase 10 to 11 percent until the end of this year, he said.
The drop in August could be taken as a base for calculating demand until the end of the year, he said.
In connection with the company's plan to build a new factory in Pati, Central Java, Dwi said that it would be realized soon. 
It cannot as yet be carried out because we have yet to receive the environmental impact analysis report from the government agency concerned, he said.
The report is an important requirement which has to be met by the company before starting the development and acquiring land.
Regarding funding, he said it was not a problem because the company had already set aside US$1.6 billion for the contruction of two new plants.
The rupiah fell to Rp9,310/9,315 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market late Tuesday as investors rushed for the greenback over worries about the global economic turbulence.
Investors still rushed for the dollar though the US financial crisis has led to a number of US financial companies going bankrupt, foreign exchange analyst Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara said on Tuesday.
The rupiah fell 20 points to Rp9,310/9,315 per dollar late Tuesday from Rp9,290/9,329 per dollar the day before.
Rully said the Indonesian currency would likely come under pressure in the ensuing days as investors were still worried about the global economic turbulence.
Moreover, the country's inflation rate was still high, prompting Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI to raise again its key interest rate, locally known as BI Rate, he said.
Currently, investors did concentrate their attention on the high BI Rate but tended to save their funds by buying the dollar, he said.
The market was rather panic-stricken, the more so because a number of share markers also came under pressure, he said.
Meanwhile, the dollar tumbled against other global major currencies over worries that the US government's plan to inject US$700 billion to take over non-performing loans would burden the US finance.
The euro rose to 1.4677 from 1,4572 per dollar. The dollar also fell against the yen to 106.30 from 107.38.
Publicly listed PT Indofood Sukses Makmur INDF has officially acquired a 68.57 percent stake of PT Indolakto worth US$350 million, INDF corporate secretary Werianty Setiawan said.
She said that the acquisition took place after INDF took over a 100 percent stake of Darayton Pte. Ltd through Pastilla Investment.
The company has signed a conditional sale-purchase agreement with Pastilla Investment Limited to acquire a 100 percent stake in Drayton, she said here on Tuesday.
Indolakto is a milk and milk-based product producer such as milk, butter and ice cream. 
Indolakto has so far produced products with trade marks such as Indomilk, Cap Enaak, Tiga Sapi, Ordchid Butter and Indoeskrim.
Werianty said the acquisition was expected to be completed in December 2008. 
The fund for the purchase of the stake will be taken from the company's cashflow and bank loans. 
Besides taking over its stake, the company also acquired its receivables worth US$100.5 million.
She said her company has paid the acquisition funds amounting to US$2.5 million, which is the equivalent of 15 percent of the acquisition fund at the time the agreement was concluded.
The remaining US$297.5 million or about 85 percent will be paid off in seven work days after all the conditions for the acquisition have been met.
PT Bumi Resources Tbk buys back up to 23.807 millions of its shares which are equal to 8.77 percent of a total market volume of 271.409 million shares.
The transaction was done on September 4, 2008 with PT Danatama Makmur as the broker, the company's director, Eddie J Soebari, said here on Monday.
He said the deal was settled at a price of Rp4,575 to Rp4,625 between 30 minutes after and 30 minutes before the opening of the trade. 
With it the company has so far bought back 47.836 millions of its shares.
The shareholders meanwhile in an extraordinary meeting on June 12 2008 decided it would buy back a maximum of 582.120 million shares during a period of June 12 2008 to June 12 2009.
Until now the rest of shares allowed to be bought back reaches 534.284 million shares.
Bank Muamalat is to establish the First Islamic Investment Bank Ltd with an initial capital of US$10 million in Malaysia, its president director Andi Buchori said here on Monday.
We have received the license from Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority LOFSA in Malaysia and got the letter of content from Bank Indonesia, the central bank, to establish the investment company in the country, Andi Buchori said.
He said the company would start in October this year and Bank Muamalat would add US$100 million to its capital. 
while an investment for its infrastructure development was predicted to be around US$1 million.
According to Buchori, Fist Islamic Investment Bank Ltd would have its main office in Kuala Lumpur and its secretariat office in Labuan, Malaysia.
Labuan has been known by international investors including those from the Middle East who use foreign SVP, Buchori said, 
adding that the establishment of investment bank was to withdraw funds from investors who invested in medium and long term equity financing 5-10 years.
The Deposit Insurance Agency LPS has raised its deposit insurance rate LPS Rate by 50 basis points to 9.25 percent for the Sept 15, 2008 - January 14, 2009 period in anticipation of a rise in lending rates.
LPS rate on foreign currency-denominated deposits remained unchanged at 3.50 percent, LPS Executive Chief Firdaus Djaelani said here on Thursday.
The reason behind the decision is that banks will raise their lending rates in the next few months in response to relatively tight liquidity funds in the market, he said.
The decision to raise the LPS rate was also designed to anticipate the stubbornly high inflation rates during the Ramadhan fasting month, Lebaran post-fasting month festivities and New Year festivities, he said.
The deposit insurance rate on deposits in smallholder credit banks was set at 12.75 percent, he said.
Last week, Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI raised its benchmark interest rate to 9.25 percent in response to the expected high inflation rates in the next few months.
The increase in LPS rate was the biggest the agency had ever decided.
The on-year inflation rate reached 11.85 percent in August 2008. BI has set the inflation rate target at 11.5-12.5 percent for this year and 6.5-7.5 percent for next year. 
The government plans to cut the amount of state bonds SUN to be issued this year by Rp15 trillion due to current tight market liquidity.
The situation had more or less created uncertainty for market players and put the developing countries' market into an unfavorable position because investors tended to liquidate their position in these countries to offset their loss in other places and move to other safer instruments US bonds or cash money. 
As a result of the situation, liquidity in the financial market in various countries including Indonesia was tight. 
In the case of Indonesia, the country's growing economy was now needing bigger liquidity and therefore the situation was also affecting liquidity in the national stock market and banking, he said.
He said in macro-economic terms liquidity condition and its prospect in Indonesia were still maintained in the current global market and domestic financial market fluctuations that brought an impact on the development of share price index, state bond market and the rupiah currency. 
He said the liquidity maintainance was demonstrated in the implementation in the national state budget plan until August this year in which realization of state revenues especially from taxes had shown an increase of 46 percent so that the state's income had reached 68 percent of the target.
On the expenditure side the target indeed has not been met. 
However spending for fuel oil subsidy is predicted to decline following the fall of the crude price to reduce state expenditures.
As a result the 2008 deficit is expected to drop from formerly 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product to around 1.7 percent of the GDP. 
With the drop demand for financing through issuance of bonds will drop by Rp15 trillion which eventually reduce the government's demand for liquidity from the market.
He said the government believed macro-economic liquidity would remain maintained and could support economic development. 
However problems are also linked to micro-economic liquidity at banking levels, he said.
In view of that the government along with the central bank would take measures necessary to anticipate both micro-and macro-liquidity pressures.
Among the measures to be taken were the government will improve absorption of spending and even speed up disbursement of expenditures for certain bills, reduce issuance of state bonds, speed up revision of Government Regulation Number 1 of 2007 on fiscal incentives for industries, provision of liquidity facilities for banks by the central bank through open market operations or purchase of securities and improving the regulation for the extension of the repurchase agreement facility for easing banks to obtain additional liquidity from the central bank.
He said the government and the central bank were appealing to banks and market players to remain calm and not be provoked to engage in a price or interest rate war that would only harm the industry itself.
He said the government and the central bank would continue to monitor the developments from time to time and coordinate to take necessary measures to minimize loss suffered by the financial industry or the national economy.
The government and the central bank will maintain the stability of the Indonesian financial system in facing global market fluctuations, he said.
The Asian Development Bank ADP is urging Asian developing countries to structurally reform their agriculture sector to prevent food prices from resurging.
The latest Asian Development Outlook ADO report received by ANTARA Tuesday stated the food crisis was still lingering despite declines in the prices of certain foodstuffs such as rice.
Demand is still higher than supply, said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali, adding that another shock in supply would cause an increase in the prices of cereals.
The report also said various things had caused the food crisis this year when the rice price rose from 400 US dollars per ton early in the year to 1,200 US dollars per ton in May, before finally dropping again to 730 US dollars per ton last week. 
The government must invest in public sector goods that support development of agricultural productivity and faciliate dissemination of clear market information among producers as well as consumers. 
Only an increase in supply from Asian farmers can lower food prices, Ali said. 
The report also predicted foodstuff prices at least for some time to come would not drop below their 2008 level even if Asian countries invested in the agricultural sector good harvests over a period of several years were needed to rebuild the world's cereals stocks which had dropped low. 
To achieve this, the prices of farmers' products must remain high because the agricultural input price rises with the increase in the crude oil price, said Ali.
The world is now witnessing a change in pattern, namely from declining foodstuff prices in the last three decades to the prospect of high foodstuff prices in the next decades, Ali added.
Asia must make structural reforms to adapt with the new environment where resources have become more scarce, he said
PT Lautan Luas LTLS, one of Indonesia's leading manufacturers and distributors of chemicals, has set up a subsidiary in Vietnam called Lautan Luas Vietnam Co Ltd. LLV through its subsidiary in Singapore, Lautan Luas Singapore Pte. Ltd. 
Director of LTLS Joshua Chandraputra Asali in his report to the Indonesian Stock Exchange BEI said here on Wednesday that the establishment of the new company in Vietnam was aimed at strengthening the company's manufacturing and distribution network.
Lautan Luas Vietnam Co. Ltd. is engaged in manufacturing and distribution businesses with a total capital of US$1.60 million and its shares are wholly owned by Lautan Luas Singapore Pte. Ltd.
The rupiah strengthened by 14 points to Rp9,211/9,215 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Monday evening from Rp9,225/9,232 per dollar at the weekend as investors bought up the local unit.
The rush on the rupiah was triggered by the improving regional bourse caused by a strengthening of the Wall Street index and the decline in the country's on-month inflation rate to 0.59 percent in April, foreign exchange analyst Rully Nova of publicly-listed PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk, said on Monday.
Investors bought up the rupiah as there was a positive sentiment toward the Indonesian currency, he said.
The rush on the rupiah happened in anticipation of the government's decision to raise fuel oil prices early next month, he said.
He predicted the rupiah would strengthen within a range of Rp9,110 to Rp9,115 per dollar in the days ahead given the positive market sentiment.
President Director of PT Danareksa Investment Management Priyo Santoso has estimated that the country's inflation rate, which currently tended to increase, would be down in the 2008 second quarter thanks to improving US economic indicators.
With the improvement of the US economy, inflation rate in various countries in Asia, Europe and America, will be moving downward, because the global economy is moving to a positive direction, he said here on Tuesday.
The Asian region, especially Indonesia, was very worried about the condition of the US economic growth because the US was a potential market for its export products, he said.
However, a number of US economic indicators which had showed signs of improvement, gave a hope that the US economic continued to grow following the US sub-prime mortgage crisis
Among the improving US economic indicators was the U.S. service sector which showed a better-than-expected reading of 52 for April, up from 49.6 in March. Besides, a number of US oil and mining companies were also recording a better growth, he said.
However, a number of business players were still waiting for further data on the US economy to see whether the US crisis was really over, he said.
Meanwhile, Indonesia continued to deal with its problems by among other things planning to raise fuel prices in June 2008, he said.
The rocketing world's crude oil price surge to above 120 US dollars cause Indonesia's budget deficit to increase significantly, he said.
The government asked the people to understand the government's plan to raise the fuel prices next June in order cut the budget deficit.
On the Bank Indonesia BI key rate, he said the central bank was estimated to maintain its key rate, known as BI Rate, because the April inflation rate tended to get lower to around 0.59 percent from 0.95 percent previously.
The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kadin has expressed hope Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI will not raise its key rate this month although the on-month inflation rate in April was 0.57 percent and the on-year inflation rate 8.96 percent.
Businessmen hope BI will not raise the BI Rate because until now they still believe the central bank will not do so despite the high monthly inflation rate in April 2008, the chief of the chamber's permanent committee for monetary and fiscal affairs, Bambang Soesatyo, said here on Monday.
Even without a hike in the BI Rate, the business world was already suffering due to a 6.4-11.3 percent increase in the prices of fuel oil for industries effective May 1, an increase in electricity bills, global inflation pressures, declining demand in the export market, high taxes and consumers' low purchasing power, he said.
In addition, non-performing loans had also jumped by 25 percent from 5 percent to 6.25 percent of total outstanding loans while the stability index of the financial system had risen to 1.25 percent from 1.21 percent previously, he said.
If the funancial system's stability index approaches the 2-percent level, it is a red signal because it means the economy is in turbulence, he said.
Publicly-listed satellite company PT Indosat is seeking a syndicated loan of US$200 million, its deputy president director, Kaizad B. Beerjee, said here on Thursday.
The company had assigned ING Bank NV ING and DBS Bank respectively as arranger and emission underwriter in order to support the company's plan to raise funds through a syndicated loan, he said.
The funds to be obtained from the syndicated loan will be used to finance the company's capital expenditures amounting to 1.2 billion dollars. 
The loan will come from four foreign banks, he said.
He said the loan facility was supported by a green-shoe option which enabled the facility to be increased to up to 100 million dollars.
The rupiah fell to a level of close to Rp9,250 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Monday morning as investors kept buying up the greenback amidst worries over a continued rise in global crude prices.
Investors rushed for the dollar as global crude prices are expected to continue to increase to US$140 a barrel at the end of this year, foreign exchange analyst Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk said on Monday.
The rupiah was also under market pressures due to the dollar's appreciation against the Japanese yen following rumors that the US Federal Reserve would stop lowering its interest rate at its meeting in June, he said. 
The Fed was expected to cut its interest rate by only 25 basis points to 2 percent at its meeting later this month, he said.
He predicted the rupiah would still be under pressures to edge closer to Rp9,300 per dollar because of high negative market pressures although the interest rate in the rupiah still lured foreign investors to do business in the domestic market.
Unless foreign investors put their funds in the domestic market, the rupiah might move farther from a level of Rp9,400 per dollar, he said.
The much-anticipated cut in the Fed's interest rate was expected to have no significant impact on the movement of the rupiah which is under the pressure of the surging global crude prices, he said.
But Bank Indonesia the central bank's intervention in the money market to prevent the rupiah from falling further had given boost to the local unit, he said.
Another boost to the rupiah's movement came from the bullish regional share market including Nikkei index which reached an unprecedented level of 14,000 points, up 1 percent, he said.
However, the positive factors still did little to erase worries on the part of investors who continued to buy up the dollar, he said.
Rupiah on the Jakarta inter bank spot market on Tuesday morning weakened nearly to the level of Rp9,300 per US dollar as market players were still hunting the greenback while awaiting the issuance of data on the US economy and the upcoming meeting of The Fed.
Market players mainly those from state electricity company PLN and state oil and gas company Pertamina are still buying US dollars, due to the soaring crude oil price that is expected to strengthen until end of this year, President Director of the Finance Corpindo Edwin Sinaga said on Tuesday. 
Rupiah weakened to Rp9,237/9,239 on Tuesday morning from Rp9,227/9,239 against US dollar on the previous day, a decrease of 10 points.
Sinaga said the market was still hit by worries over the unstable crude oil price which was expected to go on, causing the rupiah exchange rate on the domestic market to keep decreasing.
The crude oil price, he added, continued to soar as workers in the North Sea, Britain, were on strike which might lower its production.
As a result, rupiah would likely till the end of this month continue to plunge to the level of Rp9,300 to US dollar, he added.
The buyers, he said, would still wait for the issuance of data on the American economy which was expected to weaken, and the upcoming meeting of The Fed slated to be held later this month.
The Fed is expected to cut its interest rate to 25 basis points to 2.00 percent from 2.25 percent, he noted.
He said the government's ongoing budget deficit would likely hamper the national economic growth, hence some banks had reported that their net profits in the first quarter of this year decreased.
If the crude oil price continues to be unstable, he added, the government may raise the fuel oil in a bid to reduce the budget deficit.
The government, he said, has even been looking for more reserve funds in anticipation of possible unstable food and crude oil prices.
Meanwhile, US dollar against yen remains stable at 103.3 yen as foreign buyers keep being aware of the market prior to The Fed's meeting. 
Publicly-listed cigarette maker PT Gudang Garam Tbk said its net profit in the first quarter of 2008 fell 16.46 percent to Rp336.13 billion from the same period last year.
The drop was the result of a 13 percent rise in sales expenditures to Rp5.84 trillion from Rp5.17 trillion previously, according to the company's quarterly financial report published on Monday.
Total sales rose 6.5 percent to Rp6.91 trillion from Rp6.48 trillion.
However, operating profit dropped 12.54 percent to Rp614.87 billion from Rp702.1 billion.
The drop in net profit caused earnings per share to fall to Rp176 from Rp210 previously.
The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kadin has expressed support for Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI's decision to raise its key rate or BI Rate by 25 basis points to 8.25 percent.
The BI Rate must be raised slightly indeed to curb the inflation rate and to create a climate conducive for foreign investment, Kadin Chairman MS Hidayat said on the sidelines of a national development planning congress here on Tuesday.
The inflation rate must be controlled to prevent it from soaring due to the skyrocketing prices of commodities, he said.
BI's board of governors at its meeting on Tuesday decided to raise the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 8.25 percent after the central bank kept it unchanged for four consecutive months since last December, the decision was taken in response to high inflationary pressures and uncertainty about global commodity prices.
The board believed the factors would influence the prices of commodities in the domestic market.
Considering that the banking industry is still in good condition, the board of governors at the meeting decided to raise the BI Rate, BI Deputy Senior Governor Miranda S. Goeltom said.
Miranda said inflationary pressures were getting stronger particularly because of the rising prices of food in the global market and the higher prices of non-food commodities at home.
This must be responded to by issuing a tight macro economic policy to preserve macro economic stability and to control inflationary pressures in the days ahead. 
In order keep expectations about future developments high, BI will always adjust the BI Rate to the trend in the inflation rate, she said.
The on-month inflation rate in April was recorded at 0.57 percent, bringing the year-on-year inflation rate to 8.96 percent compared to 8.17 percent a month earlier.
PT Astra International Tbk ASII has bought 280,731,333 shares in PT United Tractors Tbk UNTR.
Through a rights issue making it a 58.54-percent stakeholder in the heavy-duty equipment maker, an UNTR executive said. 
Total UNTR shares held by ASII now reaches 1,947,604,150 which is equal to 58.54 percent, UNTR's investor relations manager Ari Setiyawan said here on Monday.
Before the rights issue ASII share ownership in the UNTR was only 1,666,872,825 which was equal to 58.45 percent with the rest belonging to other parties and the public.
Under the rights issue the ASII, as a standy buyer, bought shares that were not taken by other public sharesholders totalling 280,731,333. 
Total funds spent by the company to execute the right reached Rp2.105 trillion, he said.
Last week the UNTR completed the rights issue execution of 475,268,183 shares at a price of Rp7,500 per share or totally worth Rp3.564 trillion. 
ASII had acted as a standby buyer.
The UNTR would use the proceeds from the sale totaling Rp3.564 trillion to pay its debts 30 pct, acquire a coal mine 55 PCT and as a working capital 15 pct.
Minister of State Enterprises BUMN Sofyan Djalil predicted here Sunday that Krakatau Steel's Initial Public Offering IPO would be possible by the end of 2008 if the stock market in Indonesia rebounds.
If the stock market rebounds just like last week and may continue until the end of the year, it is not impossible that Krakatau Steel's IPO will be realized, Djalil said after inspecting the preparations of PT Indonesia Ferry to anticipate the annual exodus of people for the Idul Fitri holidays.
On September 18, legislators approved the IPOs of steelmaker PT Kratakau Steel, national flag carrier PT Garuda Indonesia and savings bank PT Bank Tabungan Negara.
The House's Commission XI authorized the government to sell a 30 percent stake in Krakatau Steel with a projected income of Rp3 trillion to Rp4 trillion.
The proceeds of the state company will be used as part of Rp 16.41 trillion earmarked for the company's expansion plan to boost production capacity, to be implemented over the next two to three years up to 2010.
State-owned construction company PT Adhi Karya Tbk ADHI intends to pull out from the Jakarta Monorail JM project because no progress is being made in its realization and not enough funds seem to be available for it, a spokesman said. 
Another reason was that implementation of the project was being constrained by the Jakarta City administration's apparent preference to build a subway system, Kurnadi Gularso, ADHI's corporate secretary, said here Thursday. 
At present ADHI was studying ways to sell its 30.1 stake, equivalent to 1.94 million US dollars, in the JM project, he added. 
Kurnadi said the JM project was still facing financing problems. 
The whole project was capitalized at 480 million US dollars but until now it had remained uncertain where about 144 million US dollars of the amount would come from. 
The project was also to be supported with external financing to the tune of 336 million US dollars but in this respect too there was as yet no clear or firm prospect, he said. 
Bank BNI is currently negotiating the capitalization of a new shariah bank it has agreed to set up in Indonesia in partnership with the Islamic Corporation for the Private Sector ICD, the bank's chief said. 
Bank BNI's target in the talks was for the planned shariah bank to be capitalized at US$500 milllion or Rp4.5 trillion with BNI holding only a minority stake, Bank BNI President Director Gatot M Suwondo said here Friday. 
If the negotiations are successful, the shariah bank's capital will reach US$500 million or about Rp4.5 trillion. 
Thereby it will be the shariah bank with the largest capital in the country, he said.
Bank BNI and ICD signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU in October 2007 to study the possibility of establishing a shariah bank as a joint venture with Bank BNI's shariah unit serving as the embryo. 
The shariah bank would be co-owned by the Islamic Development Bank IDB and was therefore expected to generate benefits for BNI and the Indonesian public in general. 
Suwondo said BNI had decided to be just a minority shareholder in the joint shariah bank so that BNI would not need to spend too much on its participation in the bank and more foreign capital could be attracted. 
I hope the negotiations with ICD can be finalized this month so that we can proceed to implement the next phase of the plan, Suwondo added.
The rupiah weakened to over Rp9,150 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Monday morning as investors bought the dollar after the greenback strengthened in the global market.
The rupiah traded at Rp9,156/9,160 per dollar compared to Rp9,143/9,146 per dollar at the weekend, down 13 points.
Money market observer Edwin Sinaga said the rupiah came under pressure following a US$6 fall in global crude prices to US$114.35 a barrel due to low demand.
Investors rushed for the dollar on speculation the European Central Bank ECB would cut its interest rates to boost sluggish economic growth, he said.
Consequently, the dollar strengthened against the euro, he said.
The dollar's exchange rate against the yen also rose to 110.25 from 110.01.
Edwin predicted the rupiah would come under constant pressure on Monday because of high positive sentiments for the dollar.
The market would still likely focus on the dollar buyups that would cause the greenback to strengthen on Monday evening, he said.
But he added that the local unit still had a great chance to strengthen despite low demand for retail state bonds bearing the serial number of 005.
The inflow of foreign capital particularly from the Middle East would give a boost to the rupiah, he said.
The rupiah had earlier hit Rp9,080 per dollar but it later plunged to near Rp9,200 per dollar.
The National Development Planning Agency Bappenas has predicted the 2009 general elections will have no impact on inflation so that the country's inflation rate target of 6.5 percent for next year can be achieved.
To anticipate high inflation next year, the government would make every effort to ensure smooth distribution of goods and preserve political stability, Slamet Senoadji, deputy for economic affairs to the state minister of national development planning/Bappenas chief, said here on Monday.
The key lies in two factors : smooth distribution of goods and political stability. And God willing, we can achieve them, he said.
He said the government would learn from the 2004 polls which according to Bappenas' record did not affect the inflation in that year.
In the draft 2009 state budget, the government has set the inflation rate target for 2009 at 6.5 percent. 
which is the same as the inflation rate forecast quoted in the revised 2008 state budget.
Meanwhile, the on-year inflation rate in July 2008 reached 11.9 percent.
Publicly-listed telecommunications operator PT Bakrie Telecom Tbk BTEL said on Monday its net profit in the first half of 2008 jumped 59.5 percent to Rp62.4 billion from a year earlier, fueled by an increase in the number of customers.
The number of BTEL customers in the first semester of 2008 rose almost one-and-a-half fold or 141.9 percent compared to the same period last year, BTEL Finance Director Jastiro Abi said.
The number of BTEL customers rose to 5.4 million in the first half of 2008 from 2.2 million in the same period last year.
The Supreme Audit Board BPK could not audit state monetary policies, BPK auditor Sukoyo said here on Monday. 
 Under the law on state finances, BPK can not audit monetary policies, as the board is only allowed to audit the financial reports on Bank Indonesia's cash flow, he said. 
If there auditing has been conducted by outsiders, it could be done at the request of the House of Representatives DPR.
Performnace and other relevant matters could be audited by BPK on the request of the House, he said. 
As to the unravelling of a case on the cash low from Bank Indonesia central bank to the several lawmakers, the scandal surfaced not because of the bank's financial report, but as it was directly received from the financial report of the Indonesian banking education foundation YPPI established by Bank Indonesia. 
 We auditted the foundation's financial report very carefully and an auditing is conducted on the fact that the foundation is established by Bank Indonesia, so that it has nothing to do with the bank's financial report, he said. 
Sukoyo further disclosed that the uncovery of the cashflow from BI was started with an asset like a plot of land belonging to the bank in Kemang, South Jakarta. 
On the land owned by BI, there are some buildings which do not belong to BI but YPPI the bank's foundation which eventually caused the cash flow from BI amounting to Rp100 billion to the House to surface. 
The remarks were made by Sukoyo in response to a statement of Center of Bank Crisis' Director CBS saying that BPK could only uncover things in the financial report, but offences like corruption caused by monetary policies could not be uncovered.
The government is optimistic the country's economic growth will reach the target figure of 6.2 percent in 2009, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said.
 The government is optimistic the economic growth rate target of 6.2 percent for 2009 will be achieved, the minister said here on Tuesday.
The minister made the statement when giving the government's answers to general comments made by political party factions in the House of Representatives DPR on the Draft 2009 State Budget at a House plenary session here Tuesday.
She said the government's optimism was based on the economic growth rate figures achieved in the past eight quarters which averaged more than six percent. 
The non-oil/non-gas gross domestic products GDP which constituted the economic pulse of most of the people had last year even risen to almost seven percent. 
Mulyani said to spur the performance of the real sector, the government had adopted various policies as laid down in Presidential Instruction Inpres No 5/2008 , and continue to issue more such policies. 
The main points of the presidential instruction included the improvement of the investment climate by among other things amending the law on income tax PPh and value-added tax PPN, and acceleration of infrastructure development through , for instance, the building of thermal power pants with a combined capacity of 10,000 KW and implementing the Economic Partnership Agreement EPA. 
Although we are making various efforts, we are aware that we are also facing uncertainties, the minister said.
 She said the main constraints in the implementation of the state budget were uncertainties, instability and economic fluctuations on national as well as global scale.
 The minister said the government had also carefully assessed, from the domestic and global viewpoints, various indications and changes which could significantly affect the national economy and the state budget.
 In order to anticipate uncertainties, instability and economic fluctuations, the government had set aside reserves to ensure that the programs provided for in the 2009 state budget would be carried out, she said.
 The government has prepared funds and anticipatory steps, the minister said.
Increasing the price of liquefied petroleum gas LPG in 12-kg and 50-kg cylinders on the occasion of the fasting month was not the right time, as the August inflation was higher than predicted. 
This condition would affect the projected inflation of 11 to 12 percent, Head of the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS Rusman Heriawan said here, on Wednesday. 
Even now that the price increase has yet to be set, the price of PLG has become uncontrollable, so that state oil company Pertamina's price for the market became unclear, especially for places outside Java. 
According to the BPS, the July inflation reached 1.37 percent, while the January-July inflation stood at 8.85 percent, and the year-on-year inflation reached 11.9 percent. 
He reminded that the weight of LPG and kerosene as fuel for household use based on the inflation tray reached 2.15 percent, not to mention long term affect on food industries. 
He also said that if Pertamina wanted once again to raise the price of LPT in 12-kg and 50-kg containers, it should not be done in the next two months September and October as in these two months the inflation rate had been predicted to increase significantly. 
BPS predicted that the LPG price increase may seriously affect the government kerosene-to-LPS conversion in a bid to reduce oil subsidy. 
Now consumers who normally use LPG in 12-kg cylinders, would turn to subsidized 3-kg containers, and this change may eventually cause a serious lack of LPG in 3-kg containers, he said. 
 If this happened, Rusman said, Pertamina would lose a great deal of additional revenue from the a gas price hike, poor people especially in Java, would have problems to get kerosene, because the supply of this fuel would be reduced. 
poor people especially in Java, would have problems to get kerosene, because the supply of this fuel would be reduced. 
On Monday, Pertamina increased the prices of LPG in 12-kg and 50-kg containers respectively to Rp69,000 and Rp362,750 from Rp63,000 to Rp343,900. 
Previously the prices of LPG already rose to Rp5,250 from Rp4,250 per kg early in July, 2008, while LPG in three kg containers was sold at Rp15,000.
The government will conduct semestral evaluations of the restructurization of local clean water companies PDAM's debts to ensure the program is carried out according to good financial management principles, a minister said.
There must be a review every six months which means that in January 2009, I will get a report from my director general on what has happened, which PDAMs have made progress and which ones have not, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said here Wednesday.
It should not be misinterpreted that under the scheme, I am rewarding badly performing PDAMs and ignoring well performing ones, she said.
As per June 30, 2008, 175 clean water companies in Indonesia had a backlog of debts totaling Rp4.65 trillion made up of Rp1.5 trillion in principal and Rp3.1 trillion in non-principal debt.
The debt restructurization would be conducted through a debt-to- investment scheme or write-offs of non-principal debt.
The minister dismissed criticism that the scheme would reward poorly performing companies, saying she would evaluate whether the restructurization program was encouraging problematic companies to improve their capability to invest.
We will reward well-performing companies by giving them greater Special Allocation Fund DAK amounts, the minister said.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Drinking Water Companies Perpamsi, Achmad Mardju Kodri, said the PDAMs' debt backlog of Rp4.65 trillion consisted of carry-overs from the companies' managements in the economic crisis in 1997.
The debt restructurization program would allow PDAMs to focus on development of the drinking water industry and expand their businesses optimally.
The debt restructurization program will help PDAMs to reach the target of 10 million clean water pipe connections over the next three years, he said.
International Finance Corporation IFC, the World Bank's private investment arm, said its total investment in Indonesia now reaches more than US$700 million and expressed hope the figure will double in the next few years.
IFC Country Manager for Indonesia Adam Sack said on Wednesday the company had so far invested in a number of domestic banks such as Bank Danamon and Bank BII.
We have provided long-term loans to Danamon to help it extend more loans to SMEs. The same is also true with Bank BII through its subsidiary, WOM, he said.
IFC's investment in the two banks currently reached more than US$300 million, he said.
We are eying other banks in Indonesia but we have no urgent target for our financing, he said.
Asked about the possibility of IFC increasing its investment in the two banks, he said IFC considered the banks its working partners and would support them.
But this does not mean that we will increase our loans there, he said.
Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI predicts Indonesia's economic growth rate in 2009 will exceed the government-set target of 6.2 percent if the country does not experience any significant shock and can diversify its export products.
The assumed economic growth rate of 6.2 percent for 2009 is quite realistic.
 We believe it can be achieved and higher than 6.2 percent, BI Governor Boediono said at a working meeting with the House Budgetary Committee here on Wednesday.
Economic growth in 2009 growth would hopefully be driven by public consumption and investment, he said.
Public consumption was expected to increase in line with declining inflation and rising economic activities in the runup to the 2009 general elections, he said. 
The rise in public consumption will eventually serve as an incentive for the business world to make investment.
Investment will increase on optimism about the rise in the number of infrastructure projects, he said.
Exports would continue to contribute to the economic growth though they would grow at a slow pace, he said. 
The sluggish export growth had to do with external factors particularly a global economic slowdown and international commodity prices, he said.
Likewise, imports were expected to slow down next year, he said.
Imports will grow at a lower pace than exports because the imports will be used not only to produce export goods but also to meet consumption and investment at home, he said.
The rupiah in the Jakarta inter-bank spot market moved away from Rp9,150 against the US dollar on Thursday afternoon and strengthened to Rp9,145/9,148 per US dollar compared to Rp9,160/9,165 on Wednesday due to cotinuing high demand for the local unit among market players. 
The rupiah was quoted at Rp9,147 per US dollar at the market's opening on Thursday, he said.
He said the rupiah could soon reach Rp9,100 per US dollar as demand for it was tending to continue to increase while foreign currencies were weakening, he said.
We are optimistic the rupiah will move to the Rp9,100 level per US dollar supported by active rupiah buying by market players, he said.
At first, there was worry the rupiah would drop to the Rp9,200 level but Bank Indonesia BI intervened in the market and shored it up.
The rupiah's rise was also supported by the world crude oli price hike which depressed the US dollar, he said.
We are sure the rupiah can rise still further. Therefore, there is a great chance it will strenghten to Rp9,100 per US dollar, he said.
Publicly-listed mining company PT Aneka Tambang Antam said on Friday its net profit in the first half of this year fell by 49 percent to Rp1.465 trillion from the same period last year.
The drop in the net profit was the result of declining nickel prices due to low demand in the world market as well as rising cost following fuel oil and material price hikes, Antam President Director Alwinsyah Syah Loebis said in a press statement. 
The company also suffered Rp95 billion in losses from the rupiah's exchange rate against the dollar, thereby reducing the first-semester net profit, he said.
Income in the first semester of 2008 fell by 7 percent to Rp5.57 trillion from a year earlier due to a drop in global nickel prices although the company saw a rise in sale volume thanks to increasing nickel and gold production, he said.
This year the company plans to cut its budget by 10 percent. In addition, we will also speed up our energy conversion program. Hopefully, a feasibility study on the use of coal for our power plants can be completed at the end of this year, he said.
PT Medco Energy MEDC, through its subsidiary PT Medco E&P Tomori Sulawesi Medco Tomori, will supply gas amounting to 250 million standard cubic feet per day mmscfd to PT Donggi Senoro LNG DSLNG for a period of 15 years, MEDC director Lukman Mahfoedz said here on Monday.
Lukman Mahfoedz said that Medco Tomori will supply the gas in cooperation with its partners in a Joint Operating Body JOB, which included Pertamina-Medco E&P Tomori Sulawesi JOB Tomori and PT PHH Tomori Sulawesi Pertamina Tomori, operator of the Senoro-Toili gas field block in Central Sulawesi province.
According to Lukman, the gas supply will start in 2012 with a price referred to that of the Japan Crude Cocktail JCC. 
The total price of the gas sale is expected to reach over 12 billion US dollars.
The gas will be channeled through a 30-km pipe network which will be built by JOB Tomori, to the LNG plants.
DSLNG is a company set up by a subsidiary firm whose stake is fully owned by PT Medco LNG Indonesia Medco LNG, together with Mitsubishi Corporation MC and Pertamina Energy Services Pte Ltd Pertamina.
The ownership composition of DSLNG state is 51 percent owned by MC, 29 percent by Pertamina and 20 percent Medco LNG.
DSLNG was established to build and operate LNG refinery plants in Banggai district, Central Sulawesi province.
Besides, DSLNG will also promote the marketing and sales of LNG to Japanese buyers.
The LNG plants are estimated to have a capacity of two million tons per annum, and will process gas from the Senoro gas field of the Matindok Block operated by Pertamina.
The final investment decision to build the LNG plants is expected to be made in the fourth quarter of this year at the latest.
It is projected that the plants will be operational in the middle of 2012.
Indonesia's trade balance is in a safe position although the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS reported a deficit for the first time, a senior minister said. 
Our trade balance is safe although its composition has changed as a consequence of sustainable economic growth, Finance Minister/Coordinating Minister for Economy Sri Mulyani Indrawati said after opening a coordination meeting of the Team for Optimizing State Income here Tuesday.  
The minister said the trend in the country's economic growth was currently still strong and supported by capital goods, raw materials and consumption goods as its components. 
We observe the trend of imports has drastically increased in the past half year, she said.  
Indonesia's balance of payments which is managed by Bank Indonesia the central bank should indeed be managed prudently, she said.  
It means that our export potentials must be spurred further while imports earmarked for production are inevitable and positively correlated to the total macro economic performance, she said.   
She said efforts to maintain the balance of payments comprehensively would be related to the ability of creating a good economic environment so as to make the incoming capital both in the forms of portfolio and foreign direct investment run well. 
Limitation of consumption could only be done under the prevailing rules which have been agreed on like those in the contexts of AFTA, ASEAN etc. 
as changes cannot be made any time from tariffs or non-tariff policies like setting up quotas except for urgent matters which should be consulted with the trade minister on the compliance with international.     
BPS had earlier reported that for the first time Indonesia's balance of trade underwent a deficit of US$270 million.  
It is the first time for the trade balance to suffer a deficit as the export value is smaller than the import value. 
In 2008, our exports were valued at US$12.55 billion and imports at US$12,8 billion, BPS Chairman Rusman Heriawan said.
Economic observer Aviliani forecast on Tuesday that inflation in September 2008 would be about one percent, exceeding the August rate of 0.51 percent.
Inflation will reach this level if the government is unable to control the increasing prices of goods and services, he said.
He said inflation was expected to be relatively high in the months ahead due to an expected surge by about 10-25 percent in basic necessaries' prices.
The INDEF researcher said the government could take under control only the prices of four commodities through market operations, namely sugar, rice, cooking oil and wheat flour.
The government would be helpless with regard to the increase in the prices of other commodities because they were controlled by the market mechanism, according to Aviliani.
However, he said, there was a way to reduce the price increases, namely by supervising goods distribution.
No matter how large the number of stocks, if their distribution is not controlled their prices will go up.
He said gas for household needs, for example, if its distribution wa not controlled, it would most likely become a trigger of inflation, even without a government decision to raise its price.
In connection with an estimate that inflation would reach 12 percent in 2008, Aviliani asked BI not to increase its benchmark interest rate.
This is for the sake of banking credit growth and the development of the infrastructure and plantation sectors, he added.
The House of Representatives DPR passed an income tax bill into law at its plenary meeting here on Tuesday.
 All the 10 House factions in their final comments favored the passage of the bill into law.
Chief of the House's Special Committee on the Income Tax Bill Melchias Markus Mekeng said the amendments to the income tax law affected a number of important matters.
They included exemptions from income tax, untaxable income, tax rates, exit tax exemption and tax privileges for small- and medium-scale businesses.
The objects exempted from income tax are divided into two groups. The first group is assistances/contributions including alms received by alms collectors endorsed by the government and compulsory contributions paid by adherents of religious faiths recognized in the country.
The second group is grants received by religious, educational, social bodies including foundations, cooperatives and individuals engaged in small and micro businesses.
Under the new income tax law, the amount of untaxable income for an individual taxpayer is raised to Rp15.84 million from Rp13.2 million a year. 
The figure will be raised by Rp1.32 million if the taxpayer is married.
Income tax on individual taxpayers is subject to progressive tariffs divided into four. 
The taxable income of up to Rp50 million is subject to a 5-percent tariff, Rp50 million to Rp250 million a 15-percent tariff, Rp250 million to Rp500 million a 25-percent tariff and more than Rp500 million a 30-percent tariff.
Both the House and the government agreed to lower the tariff of income tax on resident corporate taxpayers and permanent establishments from the current 30 percent to 28 percent in 2009 and 25 percent in 2010.
The new income tax law also stipulates that a 21-year-old resident individual taxpayer who does not have a taxpayer code number and intends to travel overseas is required to pay tax to be provided for in a government regulation.
The provision will take effect until December 31, 2010. 
Under the law, small and medium micro businesses would also deserve tariff reduction as much as 50 percent of the normal tariff imposed on the taxable income from portion of the gross turnover of up to Rp4.8 billion, Melchias said.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati meanwhile said the government was preparing the implementation regulations on the law.
Hopefully, the law will take effect on January 1, 2009, she said.
Jakarta, Sept 2 ANTARA- The annual inflation rate which has reached 11.5 percent will prompt the Indonesian central bank Bank Indonesia/BI to once again raise its benchmark interest rate BI Rate which at present is 9.0 percent, an economic observer said.
BI will once again raise its rate by 25 basis points to 9.25 percent in an effort to curb the upward trend in inflation that has exceeded the government's target at 11.2 percent, Edwin Sinaga said here on Tuesday.
He said that the increase in the BI Rate was expected to encourage foreign investors to place their funds again in the Indonesian money markets.
So far, many foreign investors have withdrawn their funds and invested their money n other markets which are more profitable, he added.
Sinaga said that the rise in the BI Rate was also expected to help improve the rupiah exchange rate after it had plunged in he last several days to a level almost reaching Rp9,200 a US dollar.
He said that BI would likely try its best to maintain the rupiah rate at below the Rp9,200 rate per dollar by releasing its dollar reserves.
We predict that BI will intervene in the market by releasing its dollar currency reserves in order to protect rupiah from falling too far, he added.
He said that the rupiah would be at a secure position if its rate could be maintained at between Rp9,150 and Rp9,175.
Sinaga said that the rupiah exchange rate which had reached Rp9,195 as a result of the inflation rumors had caused a serious concern.
He said that inflation would reach 12 percent due to various negative factors taking place at home.
According to Sinaga, the fuel oil price hikes last May no longer had effect on the inflation.
 What matters now which affects inflation is the increase in the price of liquefied natural gas, he added.
The rupiah tumbled against the dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market late Tuesday, causing worries to investors as the local unit droped closer to the psychological level of Rp9,200 per dollar.
 If the rupiah hit the psychological level of Rp9,200 per dollar, it would continue to fall far beyond the level, PT Finance Corpindo President Director Edwin Sinaga said on Tuesday.
 It would be difficult to control the rupiah's continued fall as negative internal factors would put strong pressure on its movement, he said.
We believe the rupiah will weaken to beyond Rp9,200 per dollar if Bank Indonesia BI does not intervene in the money market, he said.
Ideally, the rupiah's exchange rate against the dollar should range from Rp9,100 to Rp9,200 per dollar as expected by the central bank, he said.
The rupiah came under pressure as foreign investors began to withdraw their capital from the domestic market and reinvest it in other more favorable markets, he said.
Even the issuance of state bonds received little support from the market as banks vied with each other in offering high interest on time deposits, he said.
In addition, the good prospects for US economic growth had also prompted investors to buy more dollars, he said.
Consequently, the US greenback strengthened against other Asian currencies, he said.
The rupiah would gain ground if BI raised its benchmark interest rate to curb the accelerating inflation rate, he said.
The rise in the key rate, locally known as BI Rate, was expected to boost an inflow of foreign capital, he said.
Economic observer Ercik Sugandhi predicted here Monday Bank Indonesia central bank will raise its BI rate until the end of this year to 9.75 percent. 
 BI will use a variety of instruments to curb the economic fluctuation so BI rate will not reach 10 percent, Sugandhi said.
He further said BI rate will rise about 25 points in October 9.5 percent and 25 points in November to 9.75 percent while, but stagnant in December.
 If BI rate reaches 10 percent, it will affect national economic growth, Sugandhi explained, adding the target of economic growth set at 6.2 percent will not be reached because the growth rate will only reach 6 percent.
It is because various business sectors grow slower, like property, banking, leasing and the financial sector, he said.
In early May this year, the BI rate was raised from 8 percent to 8.25 percent.
As the result, the volume of money in circulation dropped from 23.4 percent in June to 15.2 percent in July.
 So, BI is hoped to raise the its rate by not too high eventhough the rise is to offset the high inflation rate, said Sugandhi.
The rupiah strengthened by 10 points against the US dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Wednesday morning thanks to positive sentiment over the government's achievement in lowering the corruption rate. 
It showed that the fight against corruption, the reform of the bureaucracy in particular, was beginning to be appreciated by the market, Rully Nova, foreign exchange analyst of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk, said here on Wednesday.
The intensified graft eradication efforts contributed to the market's positive sentiment and encouraged market players to speculatively buy rupiah and release dollars, he said.
The campaign being conducted by the Corruption Eradication Commission KPK was successfully deterring corrupt state officials, he said.
Besides, the strengthening of the rupiah was also caused by market players looking for profits by gradually releasing their dollars after the greenback strengthened over the past few days. 
Meanwhile, the dollar which had earlier tumbled against other global major currencies, started to recover as market players were waiting for the US government's plan to inject US$700 billion to take over non-performing loans in the US property sector.
The euro fell to 1.4657 from 1,4796 per dollar. The dollar was up 105.49 from 105.42 against yen.
The rupiah was expected to strengthen further in the afternoon as the positive sentiment had the potential of continuing to bost the local unit. 
Bank Indonesia governor Boediono said here on Monday that the central bank would always be in the market to face rupiah fluctuations.
BI will always be in the market but not oppose the stream. 
We will make the rupiah movement smooth through implementation of correct policy, he said at a fast breaking gathering.
He said the policy to be used would not run against the stream that came from global movement because fighting it would need huge reserve funds.
We will enter the market using foreign exchange reserves wisely and acceptable to the market, he said.
He said the country's foreign exchange reserves now stood at US$58.4 billion.
It once reached more than US$59 but it went up and down for market operations, he said.
He said last week's fluctuations were caused by global nervous conditions because of a world economic slowdown, high inflation and damage in the economic system in the US and Europe.
In such a condition global market players will certainly try to secure their funds and bring them to their own countries and this is what has caused pressure on the rupiah, he said.
Boediono said many market players had now also considered the US dollar as the right currency for their investment so that its value had been increasing.
This condition will not last long because investors will put their money in more attractive sectors, he said.
Boediono said Indonesia's economic condition was not as bad as in other countries such as in the US, Europe and other Asian countries.
 Indonesia is only facing a high inflation compared to other countries which are not only facing a high inflation but also an economic slowdown and disrupted financial system, he said.
The Asian Development Bank ADB predicts Indonesia will play a significant role in creating Asian integration as global economic power.
So far, Indonesia has shown its important role in forming regionalism by, among other things, being one of the ASEAN founders and initiating a series of international meetings in Bali, ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda said in a seminar Emerging Asian Regionalism Trends and Challenges at the Borobudur Hotel here on Wednesday.
Indonesia would also host the 42nd annual ADB meeting scheduled for 2009 in Bali, he said.
The ADB chief noted that the global economy tended to shift to the Asian region, with a population of nearly 3.9 billion.
Asian integration may be just a dream.
But the dream full of challenges may come into reality any time in the future through small steps we can take, he said.
Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Elka Pangestu meanwhile said since the economic crisis engulfed a number of countries in 1998 ASEAN member states and their neighbors had been integrated in terms of finance and trade.
She said Indonesia was ready to step up its cooperation with other countries in trade, investment and financial sectors.
Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's largest state lender, has raised its lending rate by 0.75 percent due to a rise in its cost of funds.
The lending rate rose 0.75 percent.
The benchmark interest rate or BI Rate has several times been raised.
And we raised our lending rate only this week, the bank's micro and retail director, Budi G Sadikin, said here on Thursday.
The BI Rate currently stands at 9.25 percent. Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI has raised the key rate for the fifth month in a row since May 2008.
Consequently, annual retail and micro interest rates would increase to 12-18.75 percent. Earlier, the monthly rate was 1-1.5 percent, he said.
He said the amount of micro small and medium business credits channled by the bank in the first half of 2008 stood at around Rp20 trillion.
Since early this year, the bank had channeled credits worth around Rp250 billion to farmers in support of the country's food security program, he said.
The loans for the country's food security program carry 12 percent interest, he said.
Bank Indonesia BI governor Boediono said here on Thursday the central bank had decided to raise the BI rate by 25 basis points to 9.25 percent to control aggregate demand rise which could push price hike.
It is aimed at controlling demand so that it will not jump, he said.
The central bank made the decision which was the fifth since May this year in a board of governors' meeting on Thursday.
The bank saw threats on the inflation were still strong forcing it to raise the key rate.
 Until now pressures on the inflation remained strong as a result of fast demand growth, he said.
He said Bank Indonesia remained cautious over hike pressures on energy, food and commodity prices in the world market although they had already died down.
Bank Indonesia still considered it important to maintain and secure demand so that it continued to grow within a safe corridor to assure achievement of targets and economic stability in general within a short term, he said.
To reach the goal he said Bank Indonesia would optimize the use of all policy instruments available.
Bank Indonesia Governor Boediono advised banks here on Thursday to start exercising prudence in distributing credits.
We want normal growth to balance with the inflation target. 
This means that banks must start being prudent in distributing their credits. 
They must be careful not to make a commitment while the fund for them is not yet secured. 
So with the signal that we have given, we hope banks would adjust themselves, he said.
The central bank had signalled it would control demands by raising the key rate by 25 points to 9.25 percent. 
The decision was made to prevent demands from increasing, he said.
Economic observer Tony A Prasetyantono said the BI rate hike could slow down credit growth in case it went too fast.
 Right now there has been an overheating with credit growth reaching 35 percent and lending to deposit ratio to 76 percent. This, I think, must be controlled. 
The rate hike would force banks to raise their lending rate to control credit distribution, he said.
Tony said the rate hike was also needed to overcome liquidity problems in banks.
The recent drop in the world price of oil to up to US$105 per barrel could reduce oil and electricity subsidy and lower the government's budget deficit than current projection of 1.6 to 1.7 percent or around Rp82.3 trillion.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said after a coordination meeting with central bank officials here on Thursday said the current projected deficit of 1.6 to 1.7 percent was made based on the annual average price of Indonesian crude of US$130 per barrel.
Until August 2008 the average price of Indonesian crude was around US$122 per barrel, she said.
According to her if the average price of Indonesian crude drops, the oil and electricity subsidy of around Rp234 trillion will be down.
 In the case of oil subsidy the drop will depend upon the consumption rate while in the case of electricity subsidy it depends upon its gross volume. 
If the basis is the price used by the state electricity company PT PLN or for fuel oil realization of subsidy may be much lower, she said.
She however also warned that the drop in Indonesian crude price would automatically be followed by a reduction in tax and non-tax state income from gas and oil and other natural resources.
 Only the net will remain positive, she said.
The rupiah slowly but surely edged closer to Rp9,100 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday morning following a rush for the local unit, a money market observer said.
The rupiah continues to strengthen to Rp9,100 per dollar although it is not easy for the rupiah to reach the level because of many constraints, Edwin Sinaga said on Thursday.
The rupiah slightly rose by two points to Rp9,115/9,117 per dollar on Thursday morning compared with Rp9,117/9,133 per dollar on Tuesday.
He said the rupiah still needed time to reach Rp9,100 per dollar.
On Monday, the Indonesian currency once hit Rp9,105 per dollar but it later fell to Rp9,133 per dollar.
We are optimistic the rupiah will reach the level thanks to positive market sentiments towards the Indonesian currency, he said.
The domestic money market still showed signs of positive sentiments. 
However, the financial crisis affecting the United States and Europe would at least have a negative impact on the rupiah's movement, he said.
He said Bank Indonesia the central bank's intervention in the money market and an inflow of foreign capital gave a boost to the rupiah.
The rupiah's current exchange rate was very stable and the local unit was expected to continue to strengthen to Rp9,100 per dollar in the days ahead, he said.
Earlier, the rupiah traded at a range of Rp9,120 to Rp9,125 per dollar as investors were careful in making transactions despite the US greenback's weakening in the global market, he said.
Operating income rose 39.3 percent to Rp1.63 trillion in the first half of 2008 from Rp1.17 trillion in the same period last year, according to the company's midyearly financial report published on Thursday.
Operating profit climbed 71.1 percent to Rp715.86 billion and earning per share increased to Rp54 from Rp15 in the first half last year.
Publicly-listed cigarette maker PT HM Sampoerna Tbk announced on Thursday its net profit in the first half of 2008 fell 5.3 percent to Rp1.965 trillion from Rp2.075 trillion in the same period last year.
A rise in operating expenses to Rp1.619 trillion in the first semester of 2008 from Rp1.307 trillion in the same period last year was mainly responsible for the drop in first-semester net profit, according to the company's midyearly financial report.
Consequently, operating profit fell to Rp3.057 trillion from Rp3.065 trillion while at the same time miscellaneous expenses more than trippled to Rp186.91 billion from Rp58.39 billion due in part to pension programs.
Net sales rose 15.6 percent to Rp16.697 trillion in the first half of 2008 from Rp14.440 trillion in the same period last year while sale expenses rose to Rp12.020 trillion from Rp10.067 trillion.
The company's total assets were recorded at Rp14.618 trillion as per June 30, 2008 compared with Rp14.742 trillion previously.
State owned steel maker PT Krakatau Steel has obtained a credit facility for a non-cash loan from Bank BNI worth US$1.46 trillion, consisting of US$75 million about Rp712 billion and Rp 750 billion.
The credit was officially handed over under a credit agreement signed by Khrisna R Suparto, BNI's corporate director and Fazwa Bujang, PT Krakatau Steel's president director, here on Thursday. 
The credit indicated that the steel industry is a very potential business in line with the world's demands for steel, Khrisna said. 
The credit facility L/C on import ceiling, standby L/C, including a bank guarantee.
The one-year credit facility would be used to buy raw materials, supporting materials and spareparts in a bid to meet increasing demans for steel on the domestic market.
The rupiah edged closer to Rp9,150 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Friday evening as investors bought the local unit following the US greenback's fall against Asian currencies, an analyst said.
The rupiah's rise was relatively small because investors were still careful in buying the rupiah in large amounts despite foreign investors' worries about US economic growth, the retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, Kostaman Thayib, said on Friday.
The rupiah rose four points to Rp9,155/9,157 per dollar on Friday evening compared with Rp9,159/9,172 per dollar the day before.
He said the rupiah's slight increase mainly resulted from the rupiah buyups ahead of Friday's closing session. 
The rupiah was earlier expected to trade at Rp9,150 per dollar because of a positive sentiment from the sale of the state global bonds abroad, he said.
He said the rupiah also received a boost as short-term investors were active in putting their funds in Bank Indonesia central bank instruments.
Therefore, the rupiah's chance to strengthen to Rp9,150 per dollar was still wide open, he said.
We are optimistic the rupiah still can strengthen further, the more so because foreign investors have shown great interest in investing in the domestic market, he said.
He predicted the rupiah would move upward early next week on concerns the US financial crisis would put a further strain on the dollar.
In response to the worries about the US financial sector, the Federal Reserve would unlikely raise its interest rate again, he said.
We are optimistic the Fed will keep its interest rate unchanged, he said. 
The House of Representatives DPR and the government have agreed to reduce income tax tariff by 50 percent of normal tariffs for small and medium micro businesses which have legal entities.
The reduced income tax tariff was given to taxpayers with a business turnover of Rp4.8 billion to Rp50 billion per annum, Drajat Wibowo, member of the House's working committee on income tax bill, said at the weekend.
Citing an example, he said, if a resident taxpayer had a business turnover of Rp5 billion and posted a net profit of Rp500 million, his/her income totaling Rp480 million would be subject to a 14 percent income tax tariff.
Meanwhile, the remaining Rp20 million would be subject to a 28 percent normal tariff, he said.
If the small and medium macro entrepreneurs had no legal entities, they would be treated as individual taxpayers and subject to progressive tariff accordingly, he said.
Under the new agreement, the bigger the business turnover of small and medium macro entrepreneurs the smaller the proportion of incentives or facilities to income tax without incentives would be, he said.
He further said the House and the government also agreed to reduce income tax tariff by 5 percent of normal tariffs for publicly-listed companies which sell at least 48 percent of their shares in the Indonesia stock exchange.
The rupiah slightly rose by 5 points to Rp9,327/9,330 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Tuesday evening after it weakened in the morning, a foreign exchange analyst said.
The rupiah strengthened against the dollar as investors speculated about buying the rupiah following a strengthening of the regional stock exchange's index, Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk said on Tuesday.
He said the rupiah strengthened against the US greenback after Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI released funds from its foreign exchange reserves to ease negative pressure on the Indonesian currency.
The rupiah was expected to return to the previous level of Rp9,300 per dollar if BI kept abreast of further developments, he said.
BI wanted to keep the rupiah below Rp9,300 per dollar and therefore, it would continue to intervene in the market, he said.
The central bank considered the rupiah to be in safe position if it traded below Rp9,300 per dollar, he said.
I am optimistic the rupiah will strengthen in the ensuing days as market sentiment tends to support it, he said.
Moreover, a turbulence in global crude prices had eased and concerns about the looming US financial crisis had shown no sign of abating after the US largest financial company, Lehman Brother, suffered huge losses, he said.
Given BI's intervention in the market, the rupiah's chance of sthengthening further in the ensuing days is wide open, he said.
BI had also raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.50 percent to boost the rupiah's appreciation against the dollar, he said.
The central bank also had foreign exchange reserves which were large enough to further intervene in the money market, he said. 
The government and the House of Representatives DPR are looking into the possibility of raising the country's gross domestic product GDP to Rp5,275.9 trillion by relying on exports and investments.
With the GDP reaching that amount, our per capita GDP has actually exceeded US$2,700. 
But it seems that we were still at the level of middle income countries, Syahrial Loetan, secretary of the state minister for national development planning/chief secretary of the National Development Planning Agency Bappenas, said on Monday.
Hopefully, non-oil/non-gas exports would be the main foreign exchange earner while natural resources would be the main factor to attract investments next year, he said.
But we must keep in mind that the improving economy will make the people's consumption stronger, he said.
The Rp5,275.9 trillion GDP could be achieved if the economy grew by 6.2 percent and the inflation rate reached 6.5 percent, he said.
After all, being at the level of middle income countries would make it difficult for Indonesia to obtain very soft loans, he said.
Today, almost all loans are available only under commercial schemes, he said.
According to official data, the country's macro assumptions in the year up to May 2008 show the economic growth rate was recorded at 6.3 percent, the inflation rate at 10.4 percent, the interest rate on Bank Indonesia Certificates SBI for three-month deposits at 8.1 percent, the rupiah's exchange rate at Rp9,254 per dollar, Indonesian crude prices ICP at US$104.8 a barrel, oil production at 922,500 barrels per day, fuel consumption at 16.4 million kiloliters.
In the the revised 2008 state budget, the target of economic growth rate for 2008 has been set at 6.4 percent, inflation rate 6.5 percent, interest rate on SBI for three-month deposits 7.5 percent, the rupiah's exchange rate Rp9,100 per dollar, ICP US$95 a barrel, oil production 927,000 barrels per day, and oil consumption 35.5 million kiloliters.
Indonesia's plan to restrict its tin production, if realized, will have an impact on the global tin market as research conducted by many institutions has shown global tin production is lower than demand, a tin mining executive said. 
We still do not know what the impact will be on PT Timah Tbk's performance, if the government restricts the country's tin production starting in 2009, Abrun Abubakar, corporate secretary of publicly-listed tin mining company PT Timah Tbk, said on Monday.
Neither do we know what PT Timah's prodution ceiling will be. 
As far as we know, a regulation restricting Indonesia's tin production has not yet been issued, he said.
The government is expected to restrict the country's tin production starting in 2009 to control global tin prices.
Indonesia is the world's biggest tin exporter and second biggest tin producer.
Director General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Energy at the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry Simon Sembiring said recently the government planned to slash the country's tin production by 90,000-100,000 tons per year starting next year.
If we produce and export large quantitites of tin, its prices can fall in the global market, he said.
Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank has raised the maximum limit of inter-bank money transfers via automatic teller machines ATMs from Rp10 million to Rp25 million per account per day, an increase of Rp15 million.
The raise was stipulated in Central Bank's Notification Letter SEBI No.10/20/DASP dated May 8 which replaced SEBI No 7/60/DASP.
The central bank had made the change as the old limit was considered no longer suited to the public's present needs which had increased due to inflation, increased need to make transactions on holidays and for international transfer transactions.
The adjustment in the maximum limit was expected to enable the public to make economic transactions at higher speed while it was only effective for interbank transfers through ATMs and not for over-booking activity.
The new regulation was also not applicable to inter-banking transfers through other means, including bank clearance and real time gross settlement RTGS. 
To protect bank clients, the central bank did not change the maximum limit for cash withdrawals through ATMs which remained at Rp10 million per account per day.
The rupiah rose five points to Rp9,325/9,330 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Wednesday morning after it closed at Rp9,340/9,350 the day before.
Improvements in the regional stock market fueled by the strengthening of the Wall Street bourse and the fall of the world crude price encouraged traders to purchase rupiahs, Rully Nova, foreign exchange analyst of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara, said here on Wednesday.
He said the volume of rupiahs traded was still relatively small because traders were still cautious about market developments.
They were still concerned about fluctuations in the world crude price.
But at least, he said, the rupiah's surge which had been taking place since Tuesday had moved it to a position that was relatively far from Rp9,400 per dollar.
It was feared if the rupiah reached this level, it would continue to plunge.
The rupiah's surge was also attributed to the abatement in student demonstrations against the fuel oil price hikes. 
The government raised fuel oil prices by an average of 28.7 percent on Friday last week.
He said the rupiah was expected to continue to strengthen in the wake of the entry into the money market of the central bank, Bank Indonesia BI.
BI will intervene in the market to boost the rupiah so that it would reach a position under Rp9,300 per dollar, he said.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the money Indonesia would save by quitting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC was not very significant.
We can save money by no longer paying the membership fee but the amount is not very significant.
If Indonesia leaves OPEC, the act will be more like a gesture or of symbolic significance, the minister said here on Thursday.
She said when Indonesia pulls out from OPEC it would be a moral message to the organization's members as membership in OPEC was based on a country's ability to produce oil.
Indonesia's production capacity is only about one million barrels per day so it will not have much effect on OPEC, she said.
The minister said Indonesia's membership fee for 2008 was only about US$800,000 and it had been paid.
Mulyani said if the decision to terminate the country's membership in OPEC was made now, it would probably be realized next year. 
The energy and mineral resources minister would then handle the exit formalities. 
The finance minister noted that OPEC's objective when it was established was to regulate world oil supplies in an effort to maintain price stability.
The latest situation in Indonesia no longer allowed Indonesia to remain in OPEC because its oil consumption was bigger than it could produce.
She said oil price developments in the world were no longer decided by supply and demand.
High oil prices reduce the ability of developing countries, including Indonesia, to improve the welfare of their peoples, she said.
Given Indonesia's current status as a net oil importer, the government would rather concentrate on increasing national oil production to meet domestic demand instead of continuing to participate in efforts to influence world oil prices, he said.
Indonesia's annual receipts from excises up to last July 31 reached Rp28.25 trillion accounting for 61.8 percent of the target of Rp45.72 trillion set in the revised 2008 state budget.
Import duty receipts stood at Rp12.33 trillion or 77.93 percent of the target of Rp15.82 trillion for 2008, the directorate general of customs and excises said in an online report on Monday.
Export duty revenues were recorded at Rp10.27 trillion or 92.06 percent of the target of Rp11.16 trillion for this year, it said.
Therefore, the state revenues collected by the directorate general by July 31, 2008 reached Rp50.85 trillion out of the target of Rp74.70 trillion pursuant to Law No.16/2008 on the revised 2008 state budget.
Earlier, the Directorate General of Customs and Excise said it collected state revenues totaling Rp42.36 trillion in the first half of 2008, accounting for 56.71 percent of the target set in the revised 2008 state budget.
The figure consists of import duty revenue worth Rp10.9 trillion, export duty revenue Rp8.67 trillion and excise Rp23.60 trillion.
Publicly-listed financial service company PT Sinar Mas Multiartha Tbk has injected Rp75 billion in fresh funds into its subsidiary PT Bank Sinarmas, a spokesman said.
The additional capital does not exceed 10 percent of our corporate income and 20 percent of our equity so it does not have a material impact, Sinarmas Multiartha President Director Edward H Hadidjaja said on Monday.
Publicly-listed financial services company PT Buana Finance Tbk said on Monday its net profit in the first half of 2008 fell 41 percent to Rp32.121 billion from Rp45.190 billion a year earlier.
Operating profit in the first semester of 2008 dropped to Rp46.442 billion from Rp64.925 billion in the same period last year, the company's corporate secretary, Sudiono Pujo, said. 
The drop in net profit slashed earning per share to Rp23 from Rp32.
The company's debts rose to Rp809.301 billion from Rp542.089 billion. However, corporate income increased to Rp128.575 billion from Rp121.606 billion. 
Indonesia's year-on-year inflation rate at the end of 2008 will range between 11.5 percent and 12.5 percent, Bank Indonesia BI, the central bank, estimated in a press statement issued here on Tuesday.
It said the estimate was made regardless of the fact that the monthly and yearly inflation rates in July 2008 was respectively recorded at 1.37 percent and at 11.9 percent where the latter was slightly higher than that a year earlier at 11.03 percent.
The BI said by taking into account several risk factors and inflationary pressures that were likely to emerge until the year end, the BI estimated the year-end inflation rate would be recorded at about 11.5-12.5 percent.
In the meantime, Indonesia's balance of payments was also expected to perform better so that the stability of currency exchange rates would also be well maintained.
Foreign exchange reserves up to the end of July 2008 stood at US$60.56 billion or equivalent to the amount needed to finance imports for 4.7 months and payment of the government's external debts.
Earlier in the day on Tuesday, BI's board of governors decided to raise the BI rate by 25 basis points from 8.75 percent to 9.00 percent.
The rupiah rose 15 points to Rp9,078/9,085 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market late Tuesday following Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI's decision to raise its key interest rate earlier in the day.
BI's board of governors decided at its meeting on Tuesday to raise its key rate by 25 basis points to 9 percent from 8.75 percent, citing future risks of inflationary pressure originating from global crude and food price turbulence and demand pressure.
The rise in the benchmark interest rate, locally known as BI Rate, prompted investors to buy the rupiah, the retail banking director of Bank Mega Tbk, Kostaman Thayib, said.
He said he believed foreign investors would continue to invest in the domestic market due to the higher BI Rate.
Foreign investment portfolios would continue to flow into the country, he said adding foreign investors believed the Indonesian economy would pick up despite a global economic slowdown.
Moreover, global economic growth had been shifting to Asia from the United States and Europe, he said.
The rupiah had earlier strengthened to Rp9,070 per dollar before it closed at Rp9,078 per dollar as investors reduced their rupiah buyups ahead of Tuesday's closing session.
He said the rupiah still had room to strengthen to Rp9,000 in the days ahead thanks to positive market sentiments including the return of local funds invested abroad.
The global crude prices which tended to fall to US$120 a barrel at present would also boost the rupiah to strengthen further, he said.
We are optimistic the rupiah will hit Rp9,000 per dollar. It is merely a matter of time for the local unit to reach this level, he said.
The rupiah plunged to more than Rp9,100 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday morning as investors sold the local unit for profit.
The rupiah traded at Rp9,110/9,115 per dollar compared with Rp9,063/9,087 per dollar the day before, down by 47 points.
Investors' consolidated actions still continued as the rupiah's current position was considered fairly stable, foreign exchange analyst Rully Nova of PT Bank Himpunan Saudara Tbk. said.
This was merely a technical matter and the rupiah still had a chance to strengthen again, he said.
We are optimistic the rupiah still will appreciate again. 
The rise in BI Rate by 25 basis points to 9 percent will boost the rupiah's appreciation as foreign investors are expected to increase their investment portfolios in the country, he said.
He said Bank Indonesia the central bank/BI had earlier expected the rupiah to strengthen at a range of Rp9,150-Rp9,175 per dollar. 
The rupiah traded at below Rp9,100 per dollar over the past few days. 
The rupiah's current exchange rate met BI's expectation, he said.
BI would always try to prevent the rupiah from falling, the more so because it had adequate foreign exchange reserves, he said.
PT International Nickel Indonesia Inco said on Thursday its net profit in the first half of 2008 plunged 58.2 percent to US$295.6 million from the same period last year on declining sales.
Sales in the first semester of 2008 fell 37.3 percent to US$819.2 million from US$1.305 billion in the same period last year, Inco President Director Arif Siregar said in a press statement.
The declining sales were the result of a 4.9 percent drop in nickel matte production in the first half of this year to 37,151 metric tons from 39,052 metric tons in the previous semester, he said.
As previously expected, the low production in the second quarter of 2008 was caused by a delay in the maintenance of equipment from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2008 and the unscheduled maintenance of equipment, he said.
For its part, Inco must repair a reduction kiln because damage to a bullgear spring as well as to one of electrical kilns reduced production by an estimated 1,800 metric tons, he said.
We are trying to offset the lost production before the end of this year so we can achieve the production target of 77,000-79,000 metric tons for 2008, he said.
PT Indosat ISAT will hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting RUPSLB on August 25, 2008 to discuss a plan to change the structure of its board of directors and board of commissioners following Qatar Telcom's acquisition of most of the company's shares. 
ISAT's corporate secretary Strasfiatri Auliana said on Friday the decision to change the structure of the company's boards of directors and commissioners was taken after Qatar Telcom purchased a 100-percent stake in Indonesian Communication Limited ICL which controls 40.8 percent of ISAT's shares.
With its entry into ISAT, Qatar Telcom will place its representatives in Indonesia's second largest telecommunications operator, namely to replace representatives of Singapore's giant Temasek.
The value of ISAT's shares is estimated at US$1.8 billion. 
About 40.8 percent of ISAT's stake is controlled by Asia Mobile Holdings AMH, a company whose 75 percent shares are owned by ST Telemedia which is fully owned by Temasek.
Currently, the composition of ISAT's board of commissioners consists of Peter Seah Lim Laut as chief commissioner and Jarman, Rionald Silaban, Sio Tat Hiang, Sum Soon Lim, Sheikh Muhammed bin Suhaim Hamad Al-Thani, Lim Ah Doo, Setyanto P Santoso and Soeprapto SIP as board members.
ISAT's present board of directors consists of Johnny Swandi Sjam as president director, Kaizad Bomi Heerjee as vice president director and Wahyu Wijayadi, Raymond Tan Kim Meng, Fadzri Sentosa, Syakieb A Sungkar, Wong Heang Tuck, Roy Kannan and Guntur S Siboro as directors.
The government will pursue other ways to persuade a number of coal mining companies to pay royalties they owe the state if a travel ban imposed on their top executives recently does not work, a Finance Ministry official said. 
We have another mechanism but we cannot disclose it now, said Hadiyanto, the ministry's director general for state assets, said here Friday. 
He said the travel bans which would expire in January 2009 had been issued on the top executives of coal mining companies that had not yet paid royalties on their coal mining operations to the government.
With the issuance of the travel bans we hope they will realize that withholding state money is a mistake. 
We will lift the bans as soon as they transfer the money to the state, he said.
He said one of the royalty debtors had come to his office to lodge a protest against the travel bans.
The receivables have fallen due and the funds are in their hands while they do not realize that the money actually belongs to the state, he added.
The rupiah fell 4 points to Rp9,169/9,175 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market late Monday from Rp9,1965/9,170 per dollar at the weekend.
The rupiah fell slightly after Bank Indonesia the central banl/BI intervened in the market to support the Indonesian currency's movement, Kostaman Thayib, retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, said.
BI's effort to release funds from its foreign exchange reserves gave positive sentiments to the local unit so that it did not plunge too far against the dollar, he said.
BI intervened in the market for fear the rupiah would worsen again to Rp9,300 per dollar, he said.
Demand for the US greenback was on the increase as local companies needed a great deal of dollars to repay their maturing debts, he said.
The rupiah traded at Rp9,200 and further Rp9,220 per dollar earlier in the day due to rising demand for the dollar following its appreciation in the global market, he said.
The rush for the dollar continued after global crude prices fell to US$115 a barrel, he said.
He expressed optimism the rupiah would strengthen again due in part to an inflow of foreign capital, he said.
BI had earlier raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 9.00 percent from 8.75 percent to deal with the rising global influence on the domestic market.
The high spread between the rupiah and dollar interest rates would continue to attract foreign investment, he said.
Publicly listed PT Barito Pacific Timber BRPT has officially acquired a 77.92-percent stake in PT Tri Polyta Indonesia Tbk TPI following the completion of TPI's tender offering, BRPT director Salwati Agustina said.
BRPT is an integrated timber company owned by Prayogo Pangestu while Tri Polyta is a chemical industry firm whose shares are also partly owned by Pangestu.
The rupiah in the Jakarta inter-bank spot market this morning rose as market players were still buying the Indonesian unit while a positive sentiment was still supporting the local currency's movements, a financial analyst said here on Wednesday.
The rupiah's position moved up eight points to Rp 9,170/9,175 per US dollar from Rp 9,178/9,190 against the US dollar on the previous day.
Money market analyst Edwin Sinaga said the increase in the rupiah's rate against the US dollar happened mainly because market players were still hunting for the Indonesian currency.
 The rupiah's exchange rate still has a chance to strengthen further after undergoing an incisive price correction, he said.
Previously, the rupiah had strengthened to below Rp 9,100 per US dollar. However, due to the decline in the crude oil price which reached US$ 113,15 per barrel, the market preferred to buy US dollars.
 The rupiah's position is stable. 
Moreover, Bank Indonesia the central bank wants Indonesia's currency to be positioned below Rp 9,200 per US Dollar, he said.
He added this condition showed foreign investors' high trust in Indonesia's economic growth though it had slowed down in the second quarter of this year.
National economic growth is estimated to only reach six percent compared to 6.3 percent previously, Edwin said, adding that the rupiah still had a chance to rise further later in the day though the market had started to turn their attention to the US dollar after the decline in the world crude oil price.
However, the market's interest in the US dollar is still restrained as foreign investments are entering the country, especially investments from the Middle East and Australia, he said.
The state will be able to save up to Rp2.6 trillion if the average oil price stays at US4120 a barrel until the end of 2008, a Finance Ministry official said.
The current oil price is US$124 per barrel. 
The Finance Ministry calculates that the state will be able to save up to US$2.6 trillion if the oil price could be maintained at an average of US$120 a barrel, Anggito Abimayu, Head of Finance Ministry's Fiscal Policy Affairs, said here on Wednesday.
The saving of up to Rp2.6 trillion was made on the assumption that all ministries / state institutions used up to 100 percent of their expenditures in the 2008 state budget, he said.
With the expenditure surplus of Rp2.6 trillion the state budget deficit which is estimated at 1.9 percent in 2008 will be reduced to 1.8 percent, he said.
He said that the realization of the 2008 state budget deficit would depend on the realization of ministries / state institutions' expenditures amounting to Rp290 trillion.
Naturally, about 10 percent could be saved from ministries / state institutions' unspent budget but it is probable that they would absorb over 90 percent of the budget, Abimayu said.
The deficit of the revised 2008 state budget was set at 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product GDP or about Rp2.1 trillion. 
The figure is the difference between the state revenues/grant worth Rp895 trillion and state expenditure worth Rp989.3 trillion.
State revenues consisted of domestic income worth Rp892 trillion and grantw Rp2.9 trillion.
Domestic income consisted of Rp609.2 trillion in tax revenues and Rp282.8 trillion in non-tax receipts.
But in its semester one report of 2008, the government predicted that the deficit of the 2008 state budget would reach 1.9 percent or Rp90.6 trillion.
The figure is obtained from the difference between state revenue / grant amounting to Rp1,007 trillion and state expenditure worth Rp1,097.6 trillion.
Net sales in the first semester of 2008 jumped 59 percent to Rp1.94 trillion from Rp1.22 trillion in the same period last year due to higher CPO prices on the global market, according to the company's midyearly financial statement. 
The rise in net sales pushed up the company's operating profit to Rp756.43 billion compared to Rp367.16 billion.
Profit before tax surged to Rp764.60 billion from Rp278.60 billion and earnings per share climbed to Rp385 from Rp122.
PT Indo Tambangraya Megah, Indonesia's third largest publicly-listed coal mining company, booked US$59.38 million in net profit in the first half of this year on higher sales.
The net profit in the first semester of 2008 more than trippled compared to the same period last year when the figure was US$21.19 million, according to the company's midyearly financial statement published on Thursday.
Net sales in the first half of 2008 surged 51 percent to US$516.36 million from US$341.70 million a year earlier, causing operating profit to climb to US$95.84 million from US$46.74 million.
Established in 1987, Indo Tambangraya currently manages 87,560 hectares of coal mining concessions in South Kalimantan and East Kalimantan.
Banpu Public Company took over Indo Tambangraya in 2001.
The rupiah's exchange rate against the US dollar in the Jakarta inter-bank spot market on Thursday afternoon declined but remained in a slightly better position than in the morning because of the central bank's intervention in the market.
 Bank Indonesia the central bank entered the market by releasing US dollars to reduce market pressure on the rupiah although its position was still under pressure, a money market analyst, Edwin Sinaga, said here Thursday.
The rupiah's position moved down ten points to Rp9.178/9.180 per US dollar with the morning session reaching almost Rp9.200 per US dollar from Rp 9,178/9,190 on the previous day.
However, the rupiah's position at 9.178/9.180 per US dollar was still considered positive because it was below Rp9.200, he said.
The rupiah's position at that level, below 9.200 per US dollar, was considered safe by Bank Indonesia, he added.
The local unit strengthened to below 9.100 per US dollar once reaching 9.080 per US dollar. 
It was the sharpest increase it had ever made.
However, the rupiah did not remain long in this position after the decrease in the world crude price and a correction because foreign and local market players were active in purchasing US dollars to buy crude oil or pay maturing debts, he said.
The rupiah still had a chance to rise until the end of this year to the level of 9,000 per US dollar but the Indonesian currency was restrained by the weakening global economic fluctuation. 
Moreover, foreign investors tended to increase their investment in the country by actively producing Bank Indonesia instruments in the money market due to the high difference of rupiah interest against US dollar.
We are still optimistic the Indonesian market will give more gain than other Asian markets, he said.
The Indonesian economy expanded 2.44 percent in the second quarter of 2008, bringing the country's economic growth in the first half of this year to 6.36 percent and the year-on-year economic growth to 6.39 percent. 
The country's gross domestic product GDP stood at Rp1,230.9 trillion based on the current prices in the second quarter of 2008 and Rp518.2 trillion based on the constant prices of 2000, Slamet Soetomo, deputy for balance sheet and statistic analysis to the head of the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS, said on Thursday.
This is consistent with the business tendency index. 
The second-quarter business tendency index exceeded 100, to be exact 111.72, indictating that the business condition is getting better, he said.
The BPS noted that three sectors saw higher growth in the second quarter of 2008 than in the previous quarter. 
They are the agricultural sector which expanded 5.08 percent, the transportation and communication sector 4.1 percent and the electricity, gas and clean water sector 3.6 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the transportation and communication sector grew 19.6 percent, the electricty, gas and clean water sector 11.2 percent, and the finance, real estate and financial service sector 8.7 percent.
The agricultural sector grew 5.08 percent thanks to the high prices of plantation commodities such as CPO, rubber and pepper on the export market, he said.
The processing industry, the agricultural sector, the trade, hotel and restaurant sector contributed 27.3 percent, 14.7 percent and 14.3 percent respectively to the GDP in the second quarter of 2008.
But the BPS noted the agricultural sector saw a decline in its capacity to create added value compared to the previous year.
This is apparently because of seasonal factors for which we need to keep watch in the future, he said.
Compared to the previous quarter, household consumption in the second quarter of 2008 rose 1.1 percent, government consumption 21.2 percent, gross fixed capital 2.4 percent, goods and service exports 5.2 percent and goods and service imports 5.4 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, household consumption in the second quarter of 2008 increased 5.3 percent, government consumption 2.2 percent, gross fixed capital 12.8 percent, goods and service exports 16.1 percent and goods and service imports 16.7 percent.
Citi Corp analysts predicted Thursday the Indonesian economy will grow 6 percent in 2008 after the Central Bureau of Statistics BPS announced earlier in the day the country's economy expanded 6.36 percent in the first half of this year.
The first-half economic growth rate came as a surprise as it exceeded the economic growth rate forecast of 6.1 percent, the analysts said in a press statement.
The higher-than-expected economic growth lowered the risks of foreign and domestic demands, they said.
They predicted the Indonesian economy would grow at a moderate level this year amidst the current global economic slowdown.
The government continued to expect a rise in tax receipts next year despite a cut in income tax rate for bodies to 28 percent from 30 percent and income tax rate for individuals to 30 percent from 35 percent pursuant to the new income tax law, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said in his state-of-the-nation address before the House of Representatives DPR here Friday.
He said income tax rate for small and medium enterprises remained at 15 percent or 50 percent lower than the income tax rate for bodies. 
In addition, the government had also decided to raise the amount of untaxed income of individual taxpayers to Rp15.8 million from Rp13.2 million previously to ease small and medium scale taxpayers' burden, he said.
All of this is a form of equility in our tax policy, an equality accompanied by responsibility.
We shall continue to take measures for the expansion of the tax base and the improvement of tax administrative system aimed at reaching the increasingly high target, he said.
The president said non-tax state receipts were projected to increase to Rp295.3 trillion next year, or an increase of Rp12.5 trillion from the revised 2008 state budget.
The government will allocate Rp227.2 trillion or 27.8 percent of its eexpenditures in the 2009 State Budget to subsidies, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said. 
The amounts to be spent on various subsidies in the 2009 Draft State Budget would be Rp 101.4 trillion for fuel oil,Rp60.4 trillion for electricity and Rp60.4 trillion for food, fertilizer and seedlings, Yudhoyono said in his State-of-the-Nation address at a House of Representatives DPR plenary session here Friday. 
The government indeed is committed to maintaining economic stability by controlling the prices of fuel oil and the basic electricity tariff, he said.
The government, however, would continue to amend the subsidy policy in order to reduce budget leakages, prevent misdirection, and to evaluate the subsidy budget based on current developments in the global oil price, he added.
Yudhoyono expressed appreciation to the public and business sector for their understanding on the policy of shifting the working hours for the industrial sector in order to reduce the electricity peak load.
Insya Allah God Willing, in the near future, electricity supply will increase through the development of 10,000 megawatt power generation that is fully supported by the government, he said.
The government has projected a deficit in the draft 2009 state budget at Rp99.6 trillion or 1.9 percent of the country's gross domestic product GDP.
State revenues and grants were expected to increase 14.3 percent to Rp1,022.6 trillion and state expenditures 13.4 percent to Rp1,122.2 trillion next year from the revised 2008 state budget, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said in his state-of-the-nation address before the House of Representatives DPR here on Friday.
With the value of the draft 2009 state budget, our state revenues and expenditures will for the first time reach the level of more than Rp1,000 trillion since Indonesia proclaimed its independence, he said.
The draft 2009 state budget represented a remarkable rise compared to the 2005 state budget which stood at Rp500 trillion and indicated the increasingly important role of the state budget in the national economy and development, he said.
The budget allocation for the sectors was aimed at lowering poverty rate to 12-14 percent
encouraging public participation in the educational sector ranging from elementary to high education
increasing the coverage of free health services for low-income people treated in the class III at hospitals, improving basic health services for all citizens treated at public health service posts.
enabling people from all walks of live to have greater access to transportation services.
PT Sunson Textile Manufacturer Tbk SSTM said on Friday its net profit in the first semester of 2008 surged 275 percent to Rp15.888 billion from the same period last year due to higher operating income.
Operating profit in the first half of 2008 plunged to Rp1.135 billion from Rp4.742 billion in the same period last year. 
However, miscellaneous income jumped to Rp27.711 billion, causing the net profit to surge, he said.
The government plans to sell three types of state bonds worth Rp3 trillion in an auction on August 26, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.
The bonds up for auction would bear the serial numbers of SPN20090731, FR0036, and FR0050, chief of the ministry's public relations service Samsuar Said said on Tuesday.
The SPN20090731 bonds will become due on July 31, 2009 with discounted interest payments, he said.
The FR0036 bonds which carried a fixed interest rate of 11.5 percent would mature on September 15, 2019 and the FR0050 bonds which carried a fixed interest rate of 10.5 percent would fall due on July 15, 2038, he said.
Interest on the FR0036 bonds would be paid every March 15 and September 15 and that on the FR0050 bonds every January 15 and July 15, he said.
Bidders can submit both competitive and non-competitive purchase bids for the bonds. 
The SPN20090731 bonds allocated for non-competitive purchase will be 50 percent while the FR0036 and FR0050 bonds allocated for non-competitive purchase will be 20 percent each.
The government had the right to sell the three types of state bonds at higher or lower prices than the indicative amount, he said.
The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kadin said that the government's major challenge in 2009 was to take inflation under control owing to the fact that oil and commodity prices in the world market are still difficult to predict until the beginning of 2009.
If the government is unable to control inflation, the purchasing power of the middle will also drop. 
At present, domestic demand is still relatively good because the middle class has been able to maintain the level of its purchasing power, Bambang Soesatyo, chairman of Kadin's permanent committee for monetary and fiscal affairs, said here on Tuesday.
He said keeping inflation under control would be a key factor to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's electoral success next year, the more so because the economic growth target had been set at 6.2 percent on the back of domestic consumption and exports of non-oil, mining and plantation products.
The problem is whether or not we will achieve a good growth that can improve the people's purchasing power, lower the poverty rate and create jobs for both new and old workers, he said.
He said the steps likely be taken by banks in adjusting their interest rates and the legislative/presidential elections next year could serve as a stumbling block that the government had to pay attention to. 
It is difficult to expect a significant expansion in investment because the business climate is not conducive due to increased risk factors, he added.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has estimated Indonesia's economic growth in the second quarter of 2008 at 6.1 percent so that the economic growth in the first semester of this year was estimated at 6.2 percent.
The minister told a press conference on Wednesday that the economic growth was fueled by household consumption, government expenditure, investment, exports, high raw material and capital good imports.
Household consumption grew 5.2-5.3 percent as spending for motor-vehicles and electricity remained high, the minister said.
She said investment grew 10.4-10.5 percent while in the same period last year it was only 7-8 percent.
We will continue to boost investment so that it would reach a two-digit growth at the end of the year, Mulyani said.
Indonesia's exports in the first semester of this year also booked a growth of 11.9-12.0 percent while imports grew by 11.1-11.2 percent, the minister said.
Imports of capital goods and raw materials were high while imports of consumption goods fell so that the economic growth in quarter 3 and 4 possibly dropped, she said.
On the realization of state expenditure, the minister said that it reached 36.7 percent of the 2008 revised state budget in the first semester.
It tended to be stagnant if compared with that in the same period a year earlier, which stood at 36.6 percent. 
But this year's figure is better if compared with that in the first semester of 2006 which were 34.1 percent.
The realization of the central government's expenditure which reached 35.4 percent is better than that in 2007 which was 33.7 percent. 
Transfer to the region reached 39.9 percent, the minister said.
Thus, the economic growth at the end of the year could be kept at 6.2 percent, a pace which would be slower than the previous projection at 6.4 percent.
This indicated that our economy is not immune to the global economic crisis, she added.
On the occasion, the minister also said that in the first semester of 2008, the year-on-year inflation was recorded at 11.03 percent 6.5 percent in the state budget, Bank Indonesia's three- month certificate at 8.4 percent 7.5 pct in state budget and the rupiah exchange rate at Rp9,261 per one US dollar Rp9,100.
Besides, Indonesia's crude price reached US$104.4 per barrel US$95 per barrel in the state budget, oil lifting 937.6 thousand barrels per day 927 thousands pbd in the state budget, volumes of subsidized fuel oil 19.6 million kiloliters of the quota of 35.5 million kiloliters and the volume of kerosene-to-LPG conversion 0.43 kiloliters of the quota of 2 million kiloliters.
The rupiah fell 10 points on Thursday morning after it sharply strengthened below Rp9,200 per dollar on Wednesday following a rush for the local unit on concerns the US economy would continue to slow down, an analyst said.
The persistent US financial crisis is the main factor of the US economic slowdown. 
Still, the US dollar looks able to move upward, the retail banking director of PT Bank Mega Tbk, Kostaman Thayib, said on Thursday.
The rupiah closed at Rp9,170/9,175 per dollar in the Jakarta interbank spot market on Thursday morning compared with Rp9,160/9,192 per dollar on Wednesday.
Kostaman said the rupiah's fall was normal following its sharp increase so that it traded far below Rp9,200 per dollar.
This happened because investors sought to gain on the rupiah's sharp increase, he said.
The rupiah also came under pressure from the regional market following a drop in the Wall Street's index, he said adding the market was dominated by the rupiah's sell-offs on Thursday morning. 
But he added the rupiah still had a chance to strengthen owing to positive market sentiments to the local unit.
The positive sentiments would cause the rupiah to edge closer to Rp9,150 per dollar. 
However, the rupiah sell-offs to benefit from the rupiah's sharp rise would somewhat hinder its further appreciation.
He said a rush on the rupiah was likely to occur on Thursday evening following the rupiah's sell-offs in the morning.
The higher interest rate and foreign investors' active participation in the domestic market would likely cause the rupiah to strengthen far below Rp9,200 per dollar, he said.
Thus, the rupiah's chance of strengthening below Rp9,150 per dollar would be wide open, he said.
Meanwhile, the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 106.90 against the Japanese yen and to 1.5730 against the euro.
Indonesia's credit rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia Pefindo has reaffirmed its idA- rating for PT Bakrie Telecom Tbk BTEL and the private telecommunication company's Rp650 billion bonds I/2007 with a stable outlook.
The ratings reflected a profitable wireless business sector and potential business growth, according to Pefindo in its press statement here on Thursday.
However, the ratings were constrained by profitability margin downward, a tight industrial competition, and the EBITDA growth which was slower than debts, it said.
BTEL was established in 1993 under the name of PT Radio Telepon Indonesia Ratelindo. 
Ten years later, the company's name was changed into PT Bakrie Telecom with 'Esia' as its brand name.
The company was one of the license holders of fixed wireless services with a limited mobility. 
In delivering its telecommunication services, BTEL used a technology of CDMA 2000 1x at the frequency of 800 mHz.
After the company had gotten a national-coverage license, BTEL has expanded its businesses to Banten, West Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Sulawesi, in addition to Jakarta, according to Pefindo.
Bank Indonesia BI will study the possibility of raising banks' minimum reserves requirement GWMin order to offset increasing inflation as a result of the upward trend in world crude prices, BI Governor Boediono said.
Markus made the statement after signing an economic cooperation agreement between ICBC and the local government of Yunnan province.
He said the value of Indonesia-China trade in 2006 was recorded at 19.6 billion US dollars, adding that with the cooperation it was expected that the figure would increase 15 percent.
That is the target of the two nations where they will increase their bilateral trade to 30 billion US dollars in 2010, he added.
Besides, Chinese investors were also expected to invest in Indonesia in the future.
With the entry of Chinese investment into Indonesia, economic conditions in the latter were expected to improve.
Thirty-five years ago, China was nothing compared with Indonesia.
Historically, inflation is a dominant economic problem besides work opportunity that has been faced for a long time by society in the world.
History indicates that one of the countries marked by rapid price increase is Egypt in around 330 BC.
According to Samuelson inflation problem is as old as market economy.
Inflation is an economic phenomenon that receives a lot of attention, and being afraid of at the same time and considered as enemy by economists, governments, entrepreneurs, up to public.
Certainly it because of the impact of inflation which is very harmful.
How harmful inflation itself can be described by some words launched by economists and government officers.
Ronald Reagan ever said inflation with terms ruthless, robbery, scaring, gunned robber, deathly, and professional killer.
Many efforts have been conducted to combat inflation, but there is no sign of ending.
As if depicting inflation as living creature that has its own protection mechanism from attacks of other living creatures, so it cannot be destroyed.
However it is certainly impossible because inflation itself is only a phenomenon, not living creature.
Several assessments and theories have been produced by economists as solution of inflation problem.
In this regard, there are three major theories describing on inflation, i.e. as follow.
Quantity theory or exchange equation from Irving Fisher.
This theory basically is a reflection of classic theory.
According to this equation increasing cause of goods in general tends to lead to inflation, there are three i.e. money circulation or public is too consumptive, too much money is distributed to public, and production decreases nationally.
Keynes theory states that inflation occurs because public lives beyond its economic capability.
In other words, inflation occurs because aggregate expenditure is too big.
Because of that, solution that must be taken is by reducing government expenditure or increasing tax, and tight money policy.
Structuralist theory or long term inflation theory.
This theory examines inflation causes that originate from rigidness of economic structure, especially strength of food material supply and goods.
Because of structural causes addition of these production goods is too slow compared to economic growth, so increasing food price and foreign exchange scarcity. 
Further impact is increasing prices of other goods, so relatively long inflation occurs if development of food material producing sector and goods industry are not fixed or added.
In relation to the cause or source of inflation, economists have been able to analyze it and classify it into several categories.
However, different with the analysis result of economists on cause of inflation which is quite deep, the solution offered to solve inflation problem seems to be very shallow.
Despite in aspect of assessment and theory resulted by economists to describe inflation is quite a lot.
As proof can be seen from the concept of fractional reserve requirement system which so far has been implemented by central bank.
Fractional reserve requirement system is a banking system in which bank preserves ratio of deposit active as a guarantee for a bank that they have enough liquidity to face hard cash demand from depositor that can emerge abruptly or urgently.
Meanwhile this concept has received many sharp criticisms from many Moslem economists.
With this concept the bank can print or also multiply money to be larger which in turn affecting the amount of money distributed in public and eventually causing inflation.
This concept can work because supported by interest concept, fiat money and financial institution itself.
At one side the conventional economists argue that one causes of inflation is the amount of distributed money is high compared to the amount of goods and services available in market.
The only rational answer why that concept is operated is for the sake of interest of bank owner.
With the fractional reserve concept, bank owner can borrow its fund to deficit unit with compensation of interest that has been set.
Benefit taken by the bank via money interest is very big.
This has been actually condemned by Sir Josiah Stamp.
He said modern banking system creates money without capital.
This process may be a magnificent creation ever invented.
Banking was born in inequality and sin.
You can take anything from them, but allow right to create their money, then with a pen they will create enough money to buy back everything.
Take away this big power from their hands, then all wealth like I own will disappear, and there will be a new world that is better for life.
As such, it can be said, what has been exercised by conventional economists so far only seems like describing how inflation phenomenon occurs nicely, but cannot abolish or eliminate it. 
Impact of inflation to real sector.
Same with explaining cause of inflation, when analyzing impact of inflation conventional economists also seem to have quite deep observation.
According to them, impact of inflation is very harmful for every section, particularly for society with fixed earning such as pensioner, low employee, and teacher.
Conventional economists generally divide inflation based on severity magnitude into four types, i.e. light inflation, mild or middle inflation, high inflation, and very high inflation.
Furthermore, conventional economists believe that effect or impact of inflation depends on whether the inflation is anticipated or not.
The meaning of anticipated inflation is when price experience relative increase every year, and at the same time there is also increase at wage and real interest in amount of 10%.
As the result, occurring price change is only measurement change where public or government has anticipated the occurring inflation level.
In contrast, the unanticipated or unexpected inflation is inflation where increase of goods price that occur is not followed by increase of wage and real interest.
Based on the above classification inflation that frequently occurs factually is unexpected inflation.
This thing can be known from history of the world economy.
The impact of inflation itself can be classified into two groups, i.e. impact from economic aspect and impact from social aspect.
The followings are impacts of inflation according to economist.
From economic angle, inflation causes income redistribution and distortion of price, distortion of money use, and distortion of tax.
From social angle, further impact of income redistribution is increasing social jealousy and even can trigger riot or social crisis.
Discussion of the above inflation impact is general discussion.
It so happen impact of inflation to real sector, specially, is restricting or disturbing growth process in real sector. 
It because, with occurrence of inflation public purchasing power will decrease and later on the decrease will cause producer to reduce production level that ends at discontinuance of employment relation and increase unemployment.
Besides that, when high inflation occurs then interest rate that set by monetary authority also increases.
Because of that, real sector at high interest rate experiences fund hardship either for increasing production or developing its business because increasing of capital cost.
Surplus unit is more interested in depositing its fund in bank with bigger and certain return rate and at the same time.
As the result is malfunction of intermediation task by common bank and fund accumulation occurs in central bank.
This fact that happened in the year 2007 where fund deposited in Indonesian Bank reached hundreds trillions Rupiah.
Furthermore, conventional economists also believe that out of four inflation types namely light inflation will give impact towards economic condition positively.
Even it is said inflation absence indicates there is no positive movement in economy because prices do not change so weakens industry sector.
This opinion is based on several reasons, i.e. 
First, when goods relative price increase occurs, producer is more exited in operating and increasing its production.
Second, with increasing production then can create new job opportunity.
The above opinion can be analysis from two sides, i.e. consumer and producer sides.
From consumer side, even though inflation rate that occurs is light still burdening.
Particularly for poor people and at the same time do not have extra skill for work.
What has been said that light inflation rate can stimulate work force absorption basically only valid for them that have capability or skill.
Meanwhile for them that from the beginning are already in poverty, in which poverty cause them not to be able to reach or exercise their skill, then this reason is not valid.
In other words, light inflation that occurs still will heavily burden them which are poor and do not have skill.
Even more when goods price that increases is goods price of primary public need, even though price increase that occur is low still will burden poor people.
For example, say for instance a family head in which the monthly income that can be earned is Rp. 1.5 millions per month.
With light inflation rate of 5%, then he must take care of inflation load of Rp. 75,000 per month.
Certainly this amount is quite big for the family head.
As the result, assumption that light inflation can provide positive effect to real economy is not correct.
Because only benefiting certain party.
Meanwhile seen from producer side, as if considering producer in producing only based on profit oriented only.
Meanwhile, a producer does not only exercise his production based on motive and profit orientation.
Meanwhile can also with humanity motive and or ruhiyah.
More than that, economists also actually argue that goods price increase either in big range or small still takes cost.
The costs, for example, are catalog change cost, complain cost and opportunity loss, change cost of law and regulation, and inconveniency cost of life.
In the middle of bankruptcy Moslem in the world and Indonesia to be specific, question emerges whether hope exist for reawakening.
Factual fact that must be faced is so heavy, even more if imaging vision to reach Islam as the world leader.
Because of that many Moslems took different positions, from optimist up to pessimist.
On the other side, there are people sticks to aqidah teaching, but there is also that crosses over the pattern and crossing but does not feel to harm aqidah.
In national context, Indonesian awaken was initiated on May 28, 1908.
Educated people found essential meaning to pursue independence in the middle of colonization pressure.
They later on initiated struggle form with clear context, namely for Indonesia to be free from alien colonialism.
Because of that, strong spirit to awake is started from understanding.
Understanding to jump from thinking to action that trapped and isolated from independence and dignified freedom.
Can be imagined how more than 300 years occupation at that time had castrated frame of thinking and mentality of Indonesian people.
For common people, may be, accepting depravation and suffering without power as regular thing.
For elite and educated, whose quality and power are better, at least have two alternatives, namely taking safe position or struggling to oppose oppression.
At the end, history proved our freedom struggle could only succeed because based on firm attitude and identity in opposing occupation.
Look from economic development approach of developing countries, there are two isms in considering backwardness of a country.
The first ism that consists of linear model and neoclassic considers backwardness is caused by attaching traditional characteristics.
Because of that, main recipe to progress society level is by injecting a certain economic formula dosage.
To guarantee absorption capacity required institution reformation, thinking pattern, value system, even consideration on religion.
It is aimed for changing traditional condition into modern and professional.
The second ism sees that backwardness is caused by existence of inequality and gap among countries.
It happens because developing countries are heavily depended on capital, technology, and expert from developed countries.
Dependency does not only occur naturally, but also created structurally in relationship pattern which abridged via international organizations.
This ism is considered successful in explaining global phenomenon that really exists but fails in formulating good development pattern, besides awakens resistance to aliens in form of strengthening nationalism.
Furthermore, this ism is in fact considered as embodiment of Neomarxism.
In most country development practices in the world, and sponsored by international cooperation organizations, dominated by the first ism. 
One of its implementations is the emergence of big push theory, namely that poverty circle can be cut via big push in form of fresh capital from developed countries.
This in fact creates debt ideology, where developing countries are not confident to be able to develop without loan.
Loan flood era is started which make drowning from day to day.
With loan too an era of colonization via economy is begun.
Development strategy, investment priority, economy development pattern, and performance indicators are determined by donor organizations through advices provided.
Even though in form of advices, must be implemented as requirement of disbursement of the loan promised.
All cooperation which is imbalance is made in frame of continuing dependency to developed countries.
Unfortunately, decision makers in Indonesia digest without reserve all the advices.
Loss of independency, fragile structure of economy, social, and environment becomes regular issues.
In accordance with higher interactions among countries, in which corporation role has surpassed government, since 1980 globalization starts to be put forward.
Multi national and trans national companies from developed countries which has excessive capital uncontrolled rampantly.
By using international economic institutions and forum, such as IMF, World Bank, WTO, APEC and others, they make all countries surrender to Neoliberalism.
IMF and World Bank, as written by Stiglitz, work hand in hand in supporting neoliberalism and neocolonialism on earth through the making of Washington Consensus with Treasury Department of the US in 1980s.
The consensus dictates IMF and WB to force all countries to implement 3 basic strategies of globalization, i.e. macro stability, liberalization, and privatization.
Those three are nothing to do with effort to prosper public, even add to their bankruptcy.
Unfortunately, Indonesia is so addicted with the globalization although at the ASEAN level its economy is less competitive.
Bogor Goals, bases of globalization movement in the frame of APEC was created in Bogor, in 1994.
This condition has been more viscous until now.
Economic team of government in fact believes the model as the top model that will control the world until the end of time.
Proven that all policies are aimed for successing liberalization implementation.
Foreign capital is ideal and dream of economic development.
This virus encroaches at public level.
Grant from international organization or foundation is the sweetest candy for NGOs.
They become operators of international missions without ever re think the objective behind it.
However, it makes sense to happen because foreigners always have henchman ready to sleek the road of colonization.
Increase of prosperity will not be embodied without initial effort to be free from colonization.
Because of that awakening public economy now is similar with the urgency of nation awakening in 1908 above.
Even though not all persons are aware and believe that we now are in the colonization.
Parties like this in fact lead the country and controller of country institutions.
It is proven by how intense they mortgage natural resources and national assets to foreigners, doing privatization, and abolishing subsidy.
Whether these are pragmatic steps, but all have been documented in various regulations, for example Oil and Gas Law, Capital Investment Law, Electricity Law, National Middle Term Development Plan, and others.
Means neoliberalism has been economy platform of Indonesia.
All of those will only preserve and strengthen occupation position and make Indonesian as servant in its own country. 
Once more, to awake the economy we must free ourselves from colonization.
To do so required identity and attitude to resist.
Without those, a thousand types of discussion and solution proposal will only become merely conventionality.
The essence of the problem is at neoliberalism system that we implement so creating colonization.
With this system and its colonization emerge various poor consequences.
In term of income level widening gap occurs.
In term of production small-medium enterprise tends to be marginalized, its cluster becomes small and short.
Meanwhile big enterprise that involves limited parties tends to leave behind small-medium enterprise.
Fiscal role of government in must do business of education, health, infrastructure and prosperity is dwarfed with growing commercialization of public sector.
Meanwhile, government argues its capability is still small to be able to support public interest.
The statement is very correct because proven that the government has become poorer by design via privatization movement.
In term of asset ownership, then strategic sectors and priority projects whose benefits are guaranteed are surrendered to foreign and private. 
They as economy players in the sight of government are freed to control for all their life, so management of resources taken not with scheme for co-ownership and enjoyed by public.
In fact we know, from long time ago, that essential problem of economic prosperity not inexistence of big and rich companies, but because of its benefits do not touch public.
Because of that awakening public economy must be begun with replacement of the wrong existing system.
Further on can be fixed various partial problems such as income, production and economy structure, fiscal policy, and ownership structure and use of economy resource.
Currently we are in the middle of capitalism century.
All over the world none is free from its grip, including Indonesia certainly.
Actually every human lives on earth can see, understand and feel how impacts generated by behavior of this global capitalism.
No necessary with lecture in high economics faculty, even they who are illiterate can answer when being asked about current economy profile although cannot provide the right terms for it. 
Everybody can directly detect that there is a mess in the current economy.
Very obvious that the current economy profile keeps moving towards two opposing poles.
One of the poles brings the rich to be richer whereas the other pole keeps dragging the poorer becomes poorer with numbers keep escalating.
Because of that, in this paper the writer would like to propose two important things that must be conducted to be able to face all these phenomena.
First, we must be able to show what the real problem root, so economy condition can be like this.
Whether correct that all of this economy tragedy really source from capitalism economy teaching.
If correct, then we must have specific strategy to contain global capitalism, and at the same time can make alternative economy that can be the replacement.
To indicate connectedness of capitalism teaching with economy tragedy that develop recently, the analysis that ever proposed by Karl Marx basically is sufficient powerful to be able to understand the phenomenon. 
In developing his theory, Marx departed from vision of value on goods and services according to Adam Smith and David Ricardo.
Value of a goods is measured from how many power that have been sacrificed by labor in producing the goods.
Furthermore Marx saw that existence of production pattern change form primitive system to modern system would emerge inequality in economy.
In modern production pattern, that work are employees.
Employer as company owner in fact never involve in production process.
However, employer that enjoys all benefit resulted by the company.
Whereas power of labor is considered as part of production cost component.
Fitting with capitalism economy theory, to gain maximum profit, then one of the methods is by reducing production cost as minimum as possible.
If goods value is measured by how big power has been sacrificed, then basically occur value surplus of labor power that has been taken by employer.
As such, capitalism economy is a very cruel economy to labor and becomes heaven for capitalist.
According to Marx, in free competition, big company will always consume small company.
Because of that the number of employer will decrease, in contrast the number of employee will increase.
And so do the number of big company will become less, but its capital accumulation will be bigger.
If the number of employee gets more, then the iron wages law will be applied.
Thus, the fate of employee will be pressed whereas the capitalists will be ferocious and greedy.
The analysis presented by Marx in fact is too simple for economy development measure of current capitalism.
Because global capitalism development in this century has been advanced and complex.
The greediness of capitalist is not only up to extortion of employee and acquisition of small class entrepreneur, but also their greediness have encroached and loot in many other sectors, even with support of various facilities and organizations created by themselves.
The capitalist does not only want to grow big, but also they want to get big in a fast manner.
The way is by creating banking institution.
Its major function is to tap public fund in a fast manner, so they immediately can use to add their companies capital to get big in a short time.
In fact existence of banking institution is still considered insufficient, they keep developing their creativity.
Eventually an idea is invented to create a unique market, which later they name it as share market.
With the existence of this market, they can easily throw in their shares for public to buy, so they immediately can receive capital inflow that can make their companies to grow like octopus.
Capitalism lust never recognizes the word enough.
They never want to stop.
They do not want to stop playing at downstream market only, but they keep encroaching to take over economy sources at upstream.
With argument of economy freedom and market freedom, they also want to control economy areas that are supposed to be public property that control life of the many.
The economy areas that they keep trying to control are various sectors of mining, forestry, water, oil, gas, highway, ports, airports, etc.
If they have controlled public property sector, then for capitalist is still considered insufficient.
Later they turn to companies that owned by the state.
With argument of effectiveness and efficiency of companies, they urge those state companies to go public, by selling their shares to market with certainly cheap prices.
Getting big and fast big in fact is considered not sufficient yet.
They also want to have security on the existence of their companies.
Security guarantee can be gained if they can encroach to power sector.
Because at this sector various legal products will be made.
If they can enter this sector, then they will easily produce various legal products and policies that benefit and secure sustainability of their business kingdom.
In capitalistic democracy politics, to be power holder the most determining requirement is only one, namely must have big fund for conducting campaign and to buy people's votes.
It can only be done by capitalist that in fact wallow with money. 
The way they do there are two possibilities, namely by nominating to be power holder or the second way is by financing other person to win election and can become power holder.
They that have been nominated by capitalist, if win then they must enslave themselves to them that have financed their victory.
Is the above activity of capitalist enough, in fact still not enough.
Greediness to keep loot wealth at various sectors and various countries in fact they keep doing it.
In fact they still have real sophisticated way and almost out of human common sense.
They create an economy mechanism that can ease all their activities, namely by embodying a monetary system that really benefits them.
The monetary system they develop is by using paper money as main base.
By basing on paper money, they can obtain three advantages in one time, namely benefit from seignorage, benefit from interest rate and benefit from controlling free exchange rate.
With this three in one model they can obtain multifold benefits without necessity to work hard.
There is another sector that should not forgotten, namely educational sector.
This sector must be drowned into capitalism circle.
Their interest is so clear, namely demand for obtaining very professional workers, possess high skill and want to be paid very cheap.
The way is by throwing educational sector to their free market.
State role in managing education must be curtailed, subsidy of educational cost must be eliminated, so cost of education can be expensive and product resulted really fit with market requirement.
Educational model like this only produce people which are pragmatic, opportunist, and with servant-attitude. 
Very difficult in expensive educational world to produce idealistic people that want to think about their identity and their nation identity.
To understand whether a country is inclined to capitalism or in contrast namely socialism, then the easiest indicator to use is by seeing how big parties that control its economy sector.
If the economy sectors are controlled more by private, then the country tends to incline to capitalism and in contrast, if the economy is controlled more by state, then incline more to socialism.
By using the above indicators, we can track how far control of capitalism grip has encroached Indonesia.
In fact the path of capitalism in Indonesia can be tracked when Indonesia entering the era of New Order Government.
The New Order Government was started on March 1966.
The orientation of the New Order Government was in contrast with the previous era.
The policy of New Order is more inclined to the West and away from communist ideology.
With improvement of Indonesian politics with western countries, then foreign capital inflow started entering Indonesia, especially foreign capital investment and foreign loan started increasing.
Around early 1970s based on cooperation with World Bank, International Monetary Fund IMF, Asian Development Bank ADB was formed a consortium IGGI consisted of some developed industrialized countries including Japan to finance development in Indonesia.
At that time Indonesia was considered had shifted its economy system from socialism towards semi-capitalism.
Entering the period of late 1980s and early 1990s the economy system in Indonesia keeps experiencing shift.
Considering many policies taken by the government, we can evaluate that there is an economy mainstream that has been selected or forced to our country.
Politic economy issues in majority are taken to economy liberalization, either liberalization of finance sector, industry sector, or trade sector.
Private sector is expected to play bigger role because the government is considered failed in allocating economy resources to sustain economy growth, either originates from natural resources or foreign debts.
Pakto 88 can be considered as the mark point of policy of economy liberalization in Indonesia.
Wide spread of banking industry in Indonesia, later on followed by occurrence of foreign debt transaction of private companies which is very fast, have colored the economy of Indonesia at that time.
The economy development era of New Order eventually ended.
The peak of failure of New Order economy development was marked by explosion of monetary crisis, which followed by the collapse of all structure of Indonesian economy.
Post monetary crisis, entering reformation era, in fact the policy of Indonesian economy does not shift even a little bit form the previous pattern.
By following the lines set by IMF, Indonesia really heads for economy liberalization.
It can be measured from several major indicators.
Abolishing gradually various subsidies from government.
Means, prices of strategic goods which so far determined by the government, later on gradually will be fully surrendered to market mechanism.
The exchange rate of Rupiah is floated freely.
In compliance with agreement in LoI with the IMF, Rupiah exchange rate determination may not be pegged with fixed rate.
In other words, the magnitude of Rupiah exchange rate must be returned to market mechanism.
One mark of liberal economy is less role of government in the economy sector, including in ownership of production assets.
With the sale of BUMN state owned enterprises to private sector, either national or foreign private, means Indonesian economy is more liberal.
Active role of Indonesian Government in domains of WTO and GATT agreement.
With Indonesia entrance to the world trade order, becomes obvious the commitment of Indonesia to enter puddle of world economy liberalization or global capitalism.
Every time we talk about change, then we will be faced by two possibilities of change namely change by function or change by structure.
Considering the current economy problem faced by Indonesia, then the most urgent change that must be taken is change by structure, even though change by function should not be neglected also. 
Economy change by structure means replacing the economy system, from economy system inclined to capitalistic to a new economy system.
However, the system change does not mean to change the system economy to be socialist, because this economy system has been proven to fail.
Indonesian Bank held governor election again.
Public expectation to governor of BI that will be elected is that can guard BI in protecting stability of Rupiah value.
As a wish nothing is wrong.
Since enactment of the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 23 Year 1999 on Indonesian Bank stated that main task of BI shifted from multiple objective stimulating economy growth, creating job opportunity, and protecting stability of Rupiah value to single objective reaching and protecting stability of Rupiah value.
Said also that the final objective of monetary policy of BI in the future basically is more directed to guard inflation.
Selection of inflation as the final objective is in accordance with recent tendency of central banks in the world, in which many central banks shift to focus on effort of inflation control.
After we know that the main task of BI is to protect stability of Rupiah value.
Then afterward that we should know is the essence of Rupiah itself.
Rupiah is part of paper money type, same as dollar and Yen.
The only difference is if US dollar and Yen are part of strong currencies type, whereas Rupiah is weak currency.
In protecting stability Rupiah value BI has some strategies, among others.
Increasing interest rate and tightening bank liquidity, assessing effectiveness of monetary instrument and transmission path of monetary policy, determining final objective of monetary policy, identifying variables causing inflation pressures, formulating response of monetary policy.
On the other side, government also has strategy in protecting Rupiah namely by implementing increase of levy collection, making voluntary loan or forced loan, cutting money, freezing part or all deposit of private in banks, and reducing government spending.
From non-monetary side is also implemented strategy to protect Rupiah, namely by increasing production, payment policy, price and goods distribution monitoring.
Even though has used multi policy strategy Rupiah is still difficult to control.
Proven every year, BI and the government always got headache by how easily Rupiah value being corrected.
This condition certainly makes us to question what is that causing Rupiah value gets corrected easily.
Riawan Amin in his book Satanic Finance, True Conspiracies said that those three above are the root of all cause tremor of world economy.
Those three satanic pillars are enforced its movement by existence of floating exchange rate.
Fiat money with three supporting factors makes fiat money easily drowned and makes these four items that in fact become the cause of turmoil of world economy.
As we can see from figure 1 above, the summit or root of any monetary problem is Rupiah itself and banking system implemented and floating exchange rate system.
However, the government assisted by BI only does fixing at technical level only.
In other words only surmounting just symptom, whereas root of disease itself is not eradicated.
As the result, plausible if all policies taken by government and BI only work temporarily.
Can the new Governor of BI protect Rupiah value to be stable or even make Rupiah as a strong currency forever? The answer is certainly not.
Because root of problem is in Rupiah itself, not on the governor.
A three day conference was held on November 1967 in Geneva, Swiss.
The conference was sponsored by the Life Time Corporation presented Indonesian Government and world giant capitalist, such as oil and bank corporation, General Motors, Imperial Chemical Industries, British American Tobacco, Siemens and USA Steel.
In the conference, the Indonesian Government represented by the New Order economists educated in the US approved capitalist wish to rob Indonesian natural resources.
Freeport attained copper mountain in West Papua, an American/Europe consortium obtained nickel.
Alcoa giant attained major part of bauxite, companies of America, Japan, and France got tropical rain forest of Sumatera.
Since 1967, New Order started to liberate national economy by enacting Law No. 1 Year 1967 on Foreign Capital Investment and Freeport became the first foreign company to sign contract with the New Order regime.
In the mining area controlled by Freeport predicted gold deposit around 63.7 million pounces whereas copper 50.9 billion pounces.
It is the concession provided by the New Order to capitalists in robbing Indonesian natural wealth as compensation for the support of the United States of America to Soeharto dictatorship power.
At the early stage in power, the New Order regime begged to the US for obtaining debt and assistance in solving bankruptcy of Indonesian economy.
To assist Indonesia, the US used multilateral approach by involving IMF, World Bank, ADB, and UN.
The US emphasized that IMF and World Bank must actively involve in reconstruction process of damaging Indonesian economy.
IMF played role in economy stabilization program, rescheduling Indonesian debts, and mobilizing creation of new debt for Indonesia.
Whereas World Bank assisted national development and reconstruction of Indonesia.
The US also wanted the New Order to use text books and references from universities in America as standards in program of economy stabilization.
Since that time foreign debt is used as funding source of Indonesian development.
Foreign debt which is initially stated by government as complementary became addict.
Doctrinization of foreign debt as development income budget caused the state did not feel that APBN National Spending and Income Budget had suffered bleeding since 1986.
Since then Indonesia was drowned in debt trap so government always relies on foreign.
Hayter and Pomfret warned that foreign debt will not be given if there is no economic benefit for lender.
Foreign debt is still a powerful method for creditor in controlling natural resources of Indonesia and gaining financial benefit from project and interest of foreign debt.
John Perkins in his book disclosed his team worked to convince Indonesian government to develop infrastructure of roads, power generators, ports, airports, and industrial estate which were financed by foreign debts from World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and USAID.
Every loan must be followed by requirement that Indonesian government must use engineering and construction companies from the United States of America.
Foreign debt fund for Indonesia was never transferred to government's account, while transferred from Washington directly to office accounts of engineering and construction companies of the United States of America.
In contrast, Indonesian government must pay principal payment and its interest.
Principal payment and interest of foreign debts of government and private.
Dominance of foreign debt in form of project loan opens wide mark up practices.
In arrangement of projects funded by foreign debts project values were marked up in advanced by average 30% by creditors.
After being marked up, those foreign debts were corrupted too.
According to Jeffrey Winters during the New Order in power, US$ 10 billions of World Bank's loan were corrupted from the total loan of US$ 30 billions.
In wider scope, chairman of Corruption Expert Team of ADB Soewardi stated that around 30-50% of foreign debt of government was corrupted.
At the end burden of principal payment and interest of Indonesian foreign debt, including cost of mark up and corruption became public burden.
The pattern of New Order development which is growth oriented by pampering conglomerates especially from non-indigenous generated extreme gap.
At the time of economy growth of the New Order at its peak, income per capita reached US$ 3,500.
However if counted based on GNP alone then income per capita of Indonesia was only US$ 960.
It meant that US$ 2,540 per capita was enjoyed by foreigner.
Of per capita income US$ 960 around 80% is controlled by 300 conglomerates, more than 200 million Indonesian people only get 20%.
Non-indigenous conglomerate which amount is 224 control 90% of the whole asset of Indonesian conglomerates, whereas indigenous conglomerate which amount is 76 the assets is less than 10% of the asset of non-indigenous conglomerate.
In the name of development, the conglomerate acquires economy sector from upstream to downstream, wipes land and life source of people.
Because of that New Order development was identical with marginalization of people.
It was caused by provision of access to economy resources and access to capital extraordinarily by Soeharto regime to conglomerates and their cronies.
In the notes of Rachmat Basoeki, Trio RMS Radius - Mooy - Sumarlin that controlled state finance policy, via Indonesian Bank silently channelized Pembauran Credit for industry without warrant.
The amount of KLBI credit during 1985 - 1988 that had been disbursed by government to conglomerate reached Rp. 100 trillions.
As not satisfied to exploit state money via Indonesian Bank, the conglomerates were pampered by the Finance Minister JB Sumarlin whom issued Pakto 88 that became the initiation of liberation of banking system of Indonesia.
This banking deregulation package gave easiness to entrepreneurs to develop foreign exchange bank with capital Rp. 100 billions only and very light personnel requirement.
This provided opportunity for conglomerate with robbery mentality to sit as bank commissioner and director.
The conglomerate besides aimed for state bank as conglomeration source fund, also made private bank that they established as capital source.
In the name of development, via interest banking system the conglomerate sucked hundreds of trillions of people money for their conglomeration interest.
It was not weird if many private banks broke Minimum Threshold Credit Disbursement because most of the bank credit was distributed to their own company groups.
The coming of monetary crisis 1997 disclosed hundreds of trillions of non-performed credit at national banking system.
However the conglomerate since mid 1996 had taken away more than US$ 100 billions from banks in Indonesia to banks in Singapore.
Privatization committee decided to accept proposal of Ministry of State Owned Enterprise SOE to privatize 37 SOE.
The SOE which were privatized included 34 SOEs which newly entered 2008 privatization program and 3 SOEs which privatization were postponed in the year 2007.
The SOEs will be privatized via initial public offer in share market and direct selling to strategic investors strategic sales appointed by government Indonesian Business, 5/2/2008.
The secretary of Ministry of SOE Muhammad Said Didu said that Ministry of SOE was ready to release all government's share in 14 SOEs industry sector, whereas State Minister of SOE Sofyan Djalil said that government would sell 12 SOEs to strategic investors out of 37 SOEs which were privatized.
The government decision to do big scale privatization was shocking.
Because never before privatization was executed to as many as 37 SOEs in a year.
Since privatization policy was started in 1991, the biggest privatization occurred to 4 SOEs in a year.
The most stormy privatization occurred in 2002 when government sold 41,94% of Indosat shares to Singapore with sale price of US$ 608,4 millions.
At that year Indosat just bought 25% of Satelindo share from De Te Asia with value of US$ 350 millions.
With that purchasing the ownership of Indosat over Satelindo totally 100% with estimated value of US$ 1,3 billions.
Besides owning Satelindo, Indosat also owned company members IM3, Lintasarta, and MGTI.
In the year 2001 state earning from tax and dividend of Indosat reached Rp. 1,4 trillions.
So from financial side only the Government of Indonesia was very harmful.
Since the start privatization of Indosat was not transparent.
Singapore bargained Indosat via one of business wing of its SOE.
Weird though, when signing agreement on share purchase of Indosat, the buyer name appeared was not STT but Indonesia Communication Limited ICL which based in Mauritius, a country that became heaven of money laundering.
To Metro TV Gus Dur claimed there was 7 percent commission fee or around 39 millions dollars from total sale value that entered the account of PDI-Perjuangan for winning general election in 2004 Hidayatullah, 2002.
Learned from the Indosat privatization case, big fire sale of SOE this year is an effort to collect fund for winning general election 2009 might happen.
Should have been public since now be aware of extortion of state wealth by greedy and greedy john does.
If not, in the middle of current public life hardship, state assets keep declining while foreigners get more control of this country.
Privatization policies since 1991 up to 1997 were executed with initial public offering in in-country share market and overseas share market.
In 1991 government sold 35% of share of PT Semen Gresik, later on continued in 1994 when government sold 35% of share of PT Indosat.
In 1995, government sold 35% of share of PT Tambang Timah and 23% of share of PT Telkom, in 1996 share of BNI was divested 25% and in 1997 share of PT Aneka Tambang was sold 35%.
Privatization policy in the New Order era was exercised to close payment of Indonesian foreign debt whose amount keeps escalating.
In 1985 government foreign debt had reached US$ 25.321 billions.
In 1991 the amount of government foreign debt doubled to US$ 45.725 billions.
The amount of government foreign debt kept growing so in 1995 reached US$ 59.588 billions.
Earning from privatization of SOE in 1995 - 1997 that was used by government to pay foreign debt could reduce government foreign debt to US$ 53.865 billions in 1997.
Since the economy of Indonesia is under IMF watch, Indonesia is pressed to do economy reformation structural adjustment program based on thinking of Neoliberal - Capitalism economy.
Government intervention must be eradicated or minimized.
Privatization Indonesian economy as large as possible.
Liberalization all economy activities by eradicating all forms of protection and subsidy.
Enlarging and easing current of foreign capital inflow with bigger facility.
Under IMF, Indonesia was forced to tighten budget by reducing and eradicating subsidy, increasing primary goods prices and public utilities, increasing tax sector revenue and selling state assets by privatizing SOE.
Privatization program that was exercised by the New Order was continued by multiplying the number of SOEs sold in share market as well as to strategic investors. 
In 1998 the government sold again 14% of share of PT Semen Gresik to foreign company Cemex.
Privatization is shifting of ownership of state assets to private and foreigner.
However the Law number 19 year 2003 on SOE beautify the meaning of privatization by adding excuse in order to increase performance and value of enterprise, to enlarge benefit for the state and public, and to widen ownership of public share.
Based on the meaning of privatization in the Law on SOE, the vision of the State Ministry of SOE on privatization is to stimulate SOE to increase performance and added value of enterprises to become champion in its industry and to increase active role of public in ownership of the share.
Meanwhile in this year privatization program the excuse put forward by Sofyan Djalil is privatization of SOE is not to sell SOE, but to empower SOE itself, so will make SOE more transparent and dynamic.
Privatization is not as sweet as illustrated in the vision of the State Ministry of SOE such as the point of increasing active role of public in ownership of share of SOE. 
In glance public at large is involved in ownership of SOE, whereas we know which meant by public is not public in general, but having special meaning namely investor.
As privatization of SOE is conducted by IPO and strategic sales, then who bought shares of SOE in small or big amount is investors in share market if privatization is conducted with IPO, and single investor if privatization uses strategic sales method.
Investors in share market or single investor can come from in-country or overseas.
Meanwhile which meant by investor itself is individual that conduct infestation.
So impossible privatization will create public ownership, because public life is already very difficult with expensive prices of primary goods, education, and health, how they can invest in share market.
Moreover up to the end of 2007 foreign investor controls 60% of Indonesian share market so privatizing SOE via IPO ends up to foreigner too.
Whereas local investor, they are mostly capitalists that seek for profit, even more many conglomerates that made Indonesia bankrupt in the past has return.
According to Dr. Mansour Fakih 2003 in his book Free from Neoliberalism, the term privatization usually is wrapped with various terms and meanings. 
For instance, privatization of university is wrapped with the term campus autonomy, and the term of SOE privatization is understood as increasing public active role.
The objective of wrapping of term and meaning of privatization is to disguise public perception.
Statement of Sofyan Djalil that privatization of SOE is not selling SOE but to empower SOE is a misleading statement.
Meanwhile steps of privatization policy in Indonesia are aligned with a document owned by World Bank whose title is Legal Guidelines for Privatization Programs.
In this document there is guidance of how government conducts privatization policy by eradicating legal problem.
Ensuring government objectives and commitment toward privatization.
Amendment of laws or regulations that hamper privatization. 
Creating institution that possesses rights in implementing privatization.
Avoiding absence of right of privatization policy which can cause privatization policy cannot be executed.
In the document of USAID Strategic Plan for Indonesia 2004 - 2008 stated how this aid institution of the United States of America together with World Bank is active in privatization problem in Indonesia.
Meanwhile ADB in News Release titled Project Information: State-Owned Enterprise Governance and Privatization Program dated 4 December 2001 provided a loan of US$ 400 millions for SOE privatization program in Indonesia.
ADB wanted increase of private sector privatization in SOE which they called moving in commercial sector.
So capitalist financial institutions, capitalist countries, and capitalist investors have interests to execution of privatization in Indonesia.
In contrast the Indonesian is not interested to the privatization.
These capitalist want the Indonesian government to open looting arena for them.
They actually do not expect for improvement of economy and prosperity of Indonesian people, but what they want is to rob Indonesian wealth.
What they frequently say that privatization aims for increasing efficiency and eradicating corruption are without justification.
DR. Mansour Fakih described that there is no connection between clean SOE with take over of ownership to investor's hand.
Exactly we saw the world economic disaster in 2001 started with extensive corruption conducted by giant companies such as Worldcom and Enron.
In Indonesia private sector mostly non-indigenous descendant conducted extensive corruption in form of KLBI and BLBI.
To eradicate corruption in SOE is not through privatization but with firm and tough law enforcement without reserve.
As the Prophet Muhammad SAW said that collapse of previous societies was when commoner broke law, they implemented law firmly, but when person whom broke law was noble man, they did not fully implement law.
Because of that, if Fathimah the daughter of Rasulullah stole, I certainly would cut her hand.
Has been public secret that SOE is cash cow of officials, politicians, private, and people within SOE itself.
We also know that problem of corruption is acute from central up to neighborhood committee level, from central parliament up to parliament of regency/municipality.
However until now there is no firmed and clear policy from government in eradicating corruption.
In regard with privatization we must learn from the case of the United States of America and China.
The US that always forces neoliberal agenda to developing countries and poor countries, exactly totally reject interest of the oil and gas SOE of China CNOOC to buy the US national private oil company UNOCAL.
The government of the US, congress members, and public tried to fail the acquisition of UNOCAL by CNOOC.
Their reason is only one, namely acquisition will jeopardize national security, as stated by Byron Dorgan the US senator: UNOCAL exists in the US and has produced 1.75 billion barrels of oil.
Very stupid if the company becomes belonged to foreigner.
Privatization is main part of structural adjustment program born in Washington in 1980.
So privatization always becomes globalization and liberalization agenda supported by IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank AND, the US and other capitalist countries, and investors.
The objective of economic politic program that they support is to protect continuity of colonialization by capitalists to developing countries and poor countries.
Islam syariah prohibits state officials to make policy by surrendering economy handling to capitalist or by using capitalist's standards because besides conflicting with the syariah concept also jeopardizing state and public.
Besides that, privatization and structural adjustment program are amoral idea that stands firm on ridiculous thought of Adam Smith about laissez faire.
This ism separates government and public by abandoning its responsibility as servant and controller of public business.
Later transfer government role to capitalist either foreign investor or local investor.
Syariah dictates government has strong role in economy so may not release grip on public rights.
Privatization conducted by government relating to SOE which is categorized as public property and strategic sector/industry is not allowed by Islamic syariah.
The Prophet Muhammad SAW said: Moslems assemble in three goods, namely water, meadow, and fire.
According to Taqiyuddin an-Nabhani 2002 public property include public facility, mining which amount is very large, natural resources which its creation causing impossible to be controlled by individual.
Whereas strategic industry is industry that produces product/engine required by activities of economy sector such as manufacture industry, agriculture, transportation, and telecommunication.
From the reasons put forward by the State Ministry of SOE seem public falsehood has been conducted to fulfill interests of capitalists.
Besides that possibility is opened that there is agenda of fund raising in regard of general election 2009 as predicted by Indonesian Corruption Watch ICW last month.
The coordinator of Public Info Division of ICW, Adnan Topan Husodo said that privatization of SOE was fund source of politic.
Enough falsehood and extortion of state wealth if do not want to get sentence from Allah SWT and Rasul. The Prophet Muhammad SAW said: Whoever leader that take care of Moslem, then he/she died while he/she did unfair to them then Allah forbids the heaven for him/her.
Privatization is not solution for Indonesia but a menace for existence of service and fulfillment public need and state independency.
It is time government and people to unify in developing this country to progress and prosper people by totally implementing Islamic syariah.
Micro finance is very strategic for public economy development.
Around 39 millions of micro businesses, means 98% of the whole business entity in Indonesia still waits for micro finance access Tambunan, 2002.
Say if credit need for micro business is around Rp. 1 million, then fund need for micro finance is Rp. 39 trillions.
Certainly, a number which is not small.
As understood together, micro business is very difficult in accessing banking.
Besides difficult to fulfill requirement 5C, administration fee is also very expensive.
Say with fund of Rp. 1 billion, better to serve credit to one individual instead to serve a thousand peoples with credit Rp. 1 million each.
Existence of micro finance institution for micro businessmen like an oasis in desert.
Micro finance institution is institution focusing to serve micro businessmen.
Micro finance institution actually exists in society, but the number is too small compared to need of micro businessmen.
In the category of Indonesian Bank, micro finance institution is divided into bank and non-bank types.
Whereas the non-bank type is loan deposit cooperative, urban credit fund institution, baitul mal wattanwil, non government organization, arisan, Grameen fund scheme, ASA fund scheme, public self-support group.
Although Bank Rakyat Indonesia and Bank Pembangunan Rakyat are categorized as micro finance institutions, due to loan requirement using conventional bank method, most micro businessmen are difficult to access.
Moreover if micro finance which is identical with poverty eradication.
The question is rather difficult to answer.
Referring to Indonesian Business Newspaper namely from non-bank micro finance institution whose amount is around 9,000 units, the loan distributed to public merely Rp. 2,53 trillions.
Meant, business doers that have opportunity of access to micro finance source are 6,65%. 
The amount is certainly still too small, because only serve 2.5 millions out of 39 millions micro businessmen.
Seeing strategic role of micro finance institution, now its existence seemed will be recognized formally by government.
This signal is indicated by the making of law draft on micro finance institution by Indonesian Bank, who prepares it together with the Department of Finance.
Certainly this effort must be welcomed, because micro finance institution with non-formal status is estimated around 2/3 from the whole micro finance institution.
In absence of legal recognition of micro finance institution existence, cause reluctance of the doers in developing themselves maximally.
Skeptically, its existence will be hampered by security officer or local government apparatus.
Besides that, due to its status which is not legal yet, causing cooperation with other parties or seeking for investor becomes difficult.
Paradoxically on the other side, the signal on recognition of micro finance institution existence has made anxious the doers.
Skeptically, establishment of regulation will hamper their performance.
Trauma of bad experience in the New Order era certainly still difficult to dismantle.
In the past, establishment of regulation was not intended to ease, but to hamper public performance.
This dilemma certainly must be found for its way out.
Various anxieties and sacredness are not to evade, but in fact must be learned in deep, in order to find the solution.
Because of that particularly for maker of micro finance institution law draft, certainly need to do in depth study on various existing micro finance institutions.
Because even though have good will, but if do not know the problem can be disturbing. 
Even if have good will, but do not know the problem can be disturbing.
The philosophy of regulation for micro finance institution is to admit, protect, facilitate and encourage micro finance institution to grow, so can serve more micro businessmen.
Besides that subsidiary principle must be kept, namely function that can be conducted at low level should not be taken over by high level.
It is meant, the one at low level will be more capable, whereas the one at high level will also take care fitting its level. 
Therefrom, both will grow according to the level they work on.
Trying to review micro finance institution law draft which now was issued at Finance Ministry, there are articles which are worrying, one of them is article 10.
Stated, micro finance institution that deposit total saving over Rp. 1 billion must convert its operation into Public Credit Bank or Cooperative.
It is clear, assumption of the maker of micro finance institution law draft is equalized with micro bank.
It means a very small bank, if grows quite big then move to next class to be public credit bank.
This assumption seems to simplify the problem.
Micro finance institution is finance institution that focuses on serving micro businessmen, regardless the micro finance institution is big or small.
As known widely, finance institution generally hardly touch this marginal sector.
Thus the problem resides not on big or small the micro finance institution, but on function of the existence of micro finance institution.
If micro finance institution serves middle or big enterprise sector, it cannot be said micro finance institution.
The bigger micro finance institution as long as the function is fit surely must be supported, because will serve more micro businessmen too.
As an example, in Bangladesh there are many micro finance institutions that serve micro businessmen with very big amount.
It is clear, to serve micro businessmen whose amount is tens of million is required quite big resources, but not necessary to be a bank.
Isn't it if a bank, small businessmen will certainly faces difficulty again in accessing, because must face with conventional procedure.
Then the second problem, if micro finance institution becomes big and not become public credit bank, must convert to cooperative.
The tendency of cooperative meant here certainly loan and save cooperative that later on must follow cooperative regulation.
Nothing wrong with loan and save cooperative. 
The problem is if micro businessmen are not member and want to borrow credit to loan and save cooperative.
The micro businessmen must become members of loan and save cooperative first.
This procedure looks become long and can make micro businessmen reluctant that as business doers usually want to get fund in a fast manner.
And more, no guarantee all micro businessmen want to be cooperative members.
Signal from government to acknowledge legally existence of micro finance institution surely must be appreciated.
With clear legality will abolish uncertainty among doers of micro finance institution, so they can develop their business maximally.
Varied cooperation with investors or finance institutions of course will be more open.
However good will only is not enough.
If various existing micro finance institution are not understood sufficiently, then regulation is drafted, the result will be contra productive.
The development of micro finance institution will anxiously be hampered.
Whereas, this time micro finance institution is highly required by 39 millions micro businesses.
And unfortunately, issue on lack of understanding on micro finance institution is quite comprehendible in the Micro Finance Institution Law Draft, in which the law tends to treat it like banking.
Whereas, essentially micro finance institution grows because adapting to characteristic of local society.
Knitting of nation togetherness and independence through micro finance for coping poverty and moving public economy.
In silent looking of current Indonesianess will make us dizzy.
Hit by multi dimensional crisis makes us fall down, even as if situated at the nadir point.
And seems we do not know where to put our face, if faced by the founding fathers that established the foundation of this nation.
Let alone now we stand on earth, where the proclamators were buried.
The situation that we experience now really anxious.
Seemed, whoever will not be happy to see around 38 million populations still struggling in poverty.
That soundless cry feels to break the heart, make us rushing to offer hand.
Experience indicated if the helping hand that we offered were wrong, in fact will kill independency, initiative, and creating dependency. 
If they do not want to work, certainly cannot survive.
They are the have little, they own something despite a little.
Whether power, gotong royong tradition, family, etc.
Most of them are hard worker, but their productivities are very low.
More often the working time is unlimited, but their incomes are still minim, their effort cannot develop and only survive at subsistence level.
And if we look deeper, micro business is majority, because its amount is 98% of total business unit or 39 millions businesses.
The existence of micro business is fact of real entrepreneurship spirit among people that can become voluntary renewal. 
Besides accommodating fair distribution as mentioned above, developing this business group in reality is strategic. 
They have had productive economy activities, so the need is development and capacity improvement not growing, so easier and more certain.
If this group is empowered accurately, they will shift easily to small business sector.
Effectively reducing poverty suffered by them as well as helping handling people in poor, old and young category.
The table below shows the strategic role of micro business in reducing poverty.
In view of micro business which is very strategic, a question emerges why most of this business is difficult to grow. 
To track down that issue, the table below will indicate various problems that entrap micro businessmen.
For micro businessmen, capital problem accessibility to capital in fact is the main problem.
Due to the assumption, then accessibility of micro businessman to formal financial source is low, so most of them rely on whatever they have.
One way to solve that delicate problem namely financing micro businessman via micro finance.
In Indonesia, it is not a new issue.
Bank Rakyat Indonesia that was established since 100 years ago has aimed like that.
Micro credit approach receives new momentum, namely with existence of MS that held in Washington on 2 - 4 February 1997.
MS is a rolling sign of global movement of people empowerment via funding strengthening to people based on experience of many countries.  
Micro financing functions to provide capital support for micro-enterprises to increase their business, after that their businesses will run well and get bigger.
Both institutions whose nature are different, are tried to be organized and connected based on mutualism symbiosis spirit, or benefiting each other.
The bank will get more customers outreaching, meanwhile poor people will get access for obtaining financial support.
In Indonesia, it is known with pattern often called Pola  Hubungan Bank dan Kelompok Swadaya Masyarakat PHBK or Bank and Non-Government Group Relationship.
As the result quite big capital is available that really aimed for poor people via credit scheme.
The first form emphasizes on educational aspect for poor people, and training for independency.
The third form emphasizes on resources collection that that can be set as capital, which is aimed for poor people.
Whereas the second form is emphasized on connecting function and using existing institutions.
Poverty eradication effort and people economy empowerment whether realize or not connected with development practice that has been exercised so far that passed economic crisis and exposing its shortcomings and failures.
To assist poor people to survive in poverty until time comes for development cake to trickle down to them, various assistance for them are provided. 
The format of this assistance is varied, starting from provision of various basic needs such as food, clothes, health, and education to technical assistance and grant of equipment and capital.
The approach which often called as the first generation development approach must be acknowledged has been able to increase various social indicators significantly.
At the other side, the first generation development requires a very big cost and must be burdened by the state which in fact more and more beyond the state's capability to self support.
As the result, as in Indonesian case various development programs are more and more dependent on the state and its financing relies more on foreign loan. 
Learned from the first genreration experience, the approach on the second generation development starts to use micro finance as the major method.
The first generation development approach that concentrates on development initiative on the state has generated unfavorable impacts on both sides.
On the government side, development burdened which used to be disbursed among various society groups has sharpened and becomes the burden of the government itself.
Whereas on the society, take over of various development activities by the government has grown apathy attitude and growing large dependency.
Collapse of big business sector and conglomeration creates domino effect to Indonesian economy whose structure is already limp.
Another lesson that can be taken from that is existence of public economy sector which so far has been marginalized and in fact is able to become safety pillow of national economy.
Become common awareness that in the future public economy sector should receive decent treatment and should become alternative doer of national economy.
Taking over of development initiative makes development cost is concentrated at government.
The policy taken gives less appreciation to the fact that there is sufficient fund in the country.
Micro finance approach in the second generation opens thought that development funding can be conducted commercially using in-country fund source namely form public saving.
Woman's role has not received proper place for sometime even though it actually has extra ordinary potential.
Experience of micro finance practice in various places in fact provides different evidence.
Woman is in fact a group which is proactive and reliable in managing household economy and utilizing economic potential optimally.
Project approach during the first generation development is developed in fact most of them are not sustained.
This project approach has several characteristics, namely time constraint, work on allocated budget base, and follow up are not known.
Inherited time constraint at project approach frequently annihilates the results obtained by the project itself.
It happens because poverty problem is a complex problem whose handling cannot provide instant result and consequently requires long commitment.
Project works to spend determined allocation and no need to evaluate whether the fund spent will return or not even though the fund is a loan.
The fact indicates that various projects also never consider post project condition.
The facts become problems in project approach.
In the second generation, various development initiative put sustainability issue as the first priority.
Whereas at the other side, development doers should be empowered to be responsible in taking bigger roles.
In context of the second generation, building cooperation of various parties stakeholders in society is a very important matter.
Because of that required a joint forum of doers connected to public business development, so can communicate with, understand each other, create network, and cooperate in benefiting each other. 
One of alternatives that have been conducted according to our experience is establishment of Gerakan Bersama Pengembangan Keuangan Mikro Indonesia Joint Movement of Indonesian Micro Finance Development.
Many problems that eventually can be solved by the related parties due to existence of interaction and intensive communication.
And from traveling reflection that we experience, to assist them which are poor and weak through establishment this kind of forum, good will only is not enough.
In fact required patience, dilligence, and endurance to struggle with various delicate matters, but must keep focus on the objective.
And of the success key of this kind of forum is participation and proactive attitude of the stakeholders themselves.
And as the closing note, what we decide or not today will not mean a lot for poor people micro businessmen tomorrow or next month.
They will keep trying to survive with their own ways.
However what we decide or what we do not decide today may impact development of public economy micro business in middle run or long run.
However every generation has its own choice, whether we will fight for it, certainly it depends on ourselves.
However for sure, every choice is a reflection of an attitude.
These which will show whether we will be a big and independent nation, or may we are a weak nation and become beggar.
Those three objectives as the base of Gema PKM and the accompanied three forms of motivations of Gema PKM's members are reflection of vision on micro finance.
More than just 'knowing', many have tried to convince various parties that what they do is LKM development.
In this regard Micro Financial Institution MFI in fact is more famous and has been known since long time.
However, generally the understanding or appreciation is limited to them served by MFI itself.
The existence of micro finance can not be separated from efforts of poverty eradication.
Even attention and effort to develop micro finance is mainly based on motivation to accelerate poverty eradication effort.
This is the reason of various international institutions to move directly in micro finance activity and development of its finance institution.
Micro finance can become critical factor in effective poverty eradication effort.
Improvement of access and provision of efficient storing, funding and insurance can develop independency of poor group and their opportunity to exit from poverty.
That in fact also simultaneously indicates the importance role and need of poor people to service of finance institution which fit their characteristics.
Relating to those issues, micro finance in return can also give positive contribution to resource allocation, marketing promotion, and adoption of better technology.
Therefrom, micro finance assists improvement of economy and development, especially for poor people category. 
As mentioned above MFI development is believed as important factor in poverty eradication.
Moreover for many parties, MFI development is part of the poverty eradication itself.
Both aspects relate to each other, even though attention focus provision at one of them frequently becomes strategy that must be conducted.
Micro finance development strategy for both interests above seems quite clear and has become test-proof agreement in various discussions.
It is embodied via regulation framework development for micro finance.
Micro finance must be acknowledged, appreciated, and protected either the MFI or public related to it, and excluded from situation as an institution which is needed but illegal.
In this context MFI need to be parts of national financial system, which is supported not only by a Micro Finance Law but also various law and regulation tool.
It is connected with fund availability for MFI activity which is not originated from internal MFI itself.
It can be conducted by creating special secondary fund source or relating FMI with other existing financial institutions banking.
In fact what we decide or not today will not mean a lot for poor people tomorrow or next month.
They will keep trying to survive with their own ways.
What we decide or what we do not decide today may impact development of public economy in middle run or long run.
Because of that hope of the future accompanied by patience and consistency will become important component besides accuracy in selecting steps that will be taken.
Shaking change has shaken axis of values and faith that have benn practiced for sometime.
The collapse of New Order power is a bell signing a new start of Indonesian history.
Tide current of awareness on emancipation and democratization as if uncontained to penetrate and infiltrate awareness paradigm in managing various aspects of life in Bumi Pertiwi.  
Regional autonomy era is obviously one of manifestation of that awareness.
Regional autonomy certainly should not be understood as shifting of power centralization from center to regions deconcentration of power.
Or shifting of authoritarianism from Jakarta to capital city of each region.
Idea of regional autonomy certainly is not alienated with idea of democracy.
Core of democracy is to facilitate freedom and public autonomy so can grow as maximum as possible according to potential and context.
Regional autonomy makes government closer, know and understand public, so function as facilitator can work better.
Through this way bottom up process involving public participation in various aspect of life, certainly will be easir to embody.
In this spectacle, public is determinat subject as actor and doer, either in planning or implementation of action.
Therefrom regional autonomy is a turning point, which simultaneously understood as regional governance based on public.
The above awareness engulfs and becomes base of awareness in developing micro finance.
Because basically micro finance is a synergy as well as implementation of base philosophy of faith values on people driven in regional autonomy.
And at this aspect, turning point as well as thinking base of discussion of this paper.
Observing structure of total Indonesian economy configuration, of 39.72 millions existing business units, 39.91 millions 99.7% are public economy business or often called as micro, small and medium business MSMB. 
And if we look deeper, micro business is majority, because the amount is 98% of total business units or 39 millions businesses.
Realizing this reality, focusing public economy development particulary on micro business is a strategic issue to embody broad based development or development through equity.
Bad experience that occurred in the New Order era certainly should not be repeated.
The May 1998 riot if tracked down further, it must be admitted that economic gap is one of root problems.
Besides accommodating fair distribution as mentioned above, developing this business group in reality is strategic, at least can be seen several reasons. 
They have had productive economy activities, so their needs are development and enhancement of capacity not growth, so easier and more certain.
If this group is empowered accurately, they will easily move to small business sector.
Effectively reducing poverty suffered by themselves, also helping empowerment of public in category of poor, old and young.
Observing role of micro business which is very strategic, a question emerges why most of this business are difficult to grow.
To track that matter, the table below will show various problems that trap micro businessmen.
For micro businessman, capital issue in fact is the major problem.
Low class public generally are almost untouched and not considered to have fund potential by formal finance institution, so causing economic growth rate stranded at subsistence level only.
This public category is considered not bankable because does not have mortgage, and assumed its capacity in returning loan is low, saving habit is low, and transaction cost is expensive.
Due to those assumptions, then accessibility of micro businessman to formal finance source is low, so most of them rely on whatever capital they have.
The table below will show the reality.
The above reality proves that poor people micro businessman are not the have not, they have but a little.
Despite limitation of what they have, they are sturdy in working. It is shown from the above data; more than 90% of micro businessmen rely on their own capital.
Whereas if they borrow fund for capital, more than 70% originate from other sources.
The range of interest rate from shark loan is very high.
Despite that, amazingly micro businessman survives and works with that system.
However, certainly they stay dwarf and difficult to grow.
One way to solve that delicate problem, namely financing poor people micro businessman, is through micro finance. 
MS is a rolling sign of global movement of people empowerment via funding strengthening to people based on experience of many countries.  
Micro financing functions to provide capital support for micro-enterprises to increase their business, after that their businesses will run well and get bigger.
This form is based on saving led micro finance, where finance mobilization is based on capability owned by the poor people themselves.
This form is also based on membership base, where membership and participation toward institution have important meaning.
Forms that have been institutionalized in public among others are Non-Governmental Organization NGO, Joint Business Group, Credit Union CU, Loan and Deposit Cooperative LDC, and others.
In Indonesia, it is known with pattern often called Pola  Hubungan Bank dan Kelompok Swadaya Masyarakat PHBK.
Bank exercises direct finance service to group and Micro Business Flanking Institution plays role as bank partner to conduct group maintenance activity.
Bank gives making fee that calculated in interest rate level.
Credit agreement is established between bank and chairman or group committee that receives approval from their members.
Bank provides financial service to the group via Micro Business Flanking Institution.
Financial service and group nurturing are conducted by Micro Business Flanking Institution. Cost of pendampingan is obtained from the difference of credit interest from bank with what paid by group.
As the result quite big capital is available that really aimed for poor people via credit scheme.
The third form emphasizes on resources collection that that can be set as capital capital heavy, which is aimed for poor people.
Whereas the second form is emphasized on connecting function intermediary and using existing institutions.
To assist poor people to survive in poverty until time comes for development cake to trickle down to them, various assistance for them are provided. 
The format of this assistance is varied, starting from provision of various basic needs such as food, clothes, health, education up to technical assistance and grant of equipment and capital.
The first generation development approach that concentrates on development initiative on the state has generated unfavorable impacts on both sides.
Become common awareness that in the future public economy sector should receive decent treatment and should become alternative doer of national economy.
The policy taken gives less appreciation to the fact that there is sufficient fund in the country.
Woman's role has not received proper place for sometime even though it actually has extra ordinary potential.
This project approach has several characteristics, namely time constraint, work on allocated budget base, and follow up are not known.
In the second generation, various development initiatives put sustainability issue as the first priority.
Micro finance now is considered as institutional breakthrough to serve financing of urban people and city micro businessman.
Woman is the most suffered victim in poverty, because of that they must be the main focus.
Besides that, from field experience at various countries indicate that woman is good borrower, user and in returning credit.
In order to serve poor people continuosly, so more are served, then financially the institutions must be guaranteed to sustain.
Impact of institution existence can be measured, so evaluation can be conducted, it is aimed for improvement of institution performance.
Reflecting various matters mentioned before, clear that micro financial institution plays important role.
Aftermath of wide reach of micro financial institution, can reach villages and cities, it is a development breakthrough.
Must be admitted, development so far frequently is less fair to villagers, because tends to develop cities.
With micro business financing support, it certainly will reduce existing gap.
Besides that, with faster development of micro business will also support development of big business, and vice versa.
Villagers have quite high saving capability, proven from saving accumulation reaching 21.8 trillion Rupiah at BRI Unit Desa BRI Village Unit.
However, capability in using credit is only 9.9 trillions Rupiah on Januari 2002 or less than half Source: Bank Indonesia.
It indicates that production factor access of villagers has been absorbed by city people.
Means development access developed by villagers has been absorbed by city people, so city can grow fast while village will be stagnant.
Whereas capital outflow from region to center is indicated quite strong, it can be seen from fast development of big cities, left behind regional growth.
Micro financial institution is more capable in facilitating to make villagers or related region can use saving that they earn.
Regional independency will certainly impact national independency, because national consists of regions, so consequently dependency on foreign loans can be reduced.
Social jealousy will automatically be reduced, because fair distribution of welfare will create multiplier effect as well as interdependency between one part with another part.
Regional autonomy era is an opportunity to empower people economy by utilizing micro financial institution.
Through micro finance people economy awakening outright national economy as well as poverty reduction will be conducted by people themselves.
It is time for people to find their own way to surmount problems that they face.
In regional autonomy era, unavoidably regional actors play important roles in development of micro financial institution.
Certainly regulation is one factor for micro finance development; another factor is doers as well as stakeholders involved in the region.
Accummulation of various economic crisis impacts that occured in mid 1997 then ended up at increasing poverty level in Indonesia.
Percentage of poor people in 1998 is closed to poverty condition in 1981 and 1984.
In 1981 is 40.6 million people or 26.9% and in 1984 is 35 million people or 21.64%.
Poverty is a phenomenon that is always tried to be minimalized or even if possible to be eradicated.
In eradicating poverty is required a vision and very long hard work because poverty is very complex so many aspects influence it.
Because of that effort of poverty alleviation requires existence of identification on who, what, how, where and why people are poor.
The identification is expected can be used as basis in determining the fittest policy to overcome poverty problem.
No. 8/2002 and No. 34/2002 to ease duties and functions of Poverty Alleviation Commission PAC.
This commission is under and responsible directly to the President.
The objective of poverty alleviation is poor people.
Based on BPS Central Statistic Agency population of poor Indonesian people before crisis in 1996 was around 11.34%, after crisis in 1998 was around 24.34%, and at the end of 2000 was around 18.95%.
Distribution of poor people according to region indicates that more than 59% exist in Java-Bali, 16% in Sumatera, and 25% in Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and Irian Jaya.
Centralization of poverty pocket in Java-Bali related closely with population distribution pattern that majority exists in Java-Bali.
With centralization of poverty pocket in Java-Bali, population in Java-Bali is also fragile to economic crisis so it influences increase in number of poor people.
For that group government program that is executed is social service.
Age below 15 years is people category which is not productive yet.
Government program which is executed is social preparation.
Age between 15-55 years, namely unproductive age, program executed is economic investation and it simultaneously become the focus of poverty alleviation.
In the agreement is mentioned that according to each business plan of Bank Umum is available fund around Rp. 30 trillions ready to be disbursed with market interest mechanism.
Especially for Micro Business as part of poverty alleviation will be disbursed fund of Rp. 4.6 trillions.
If we talk about MSMB, then must consider also constraints in MSMB development.
To overcome these constraints, the approach that should be taken is provision of micro finance service.
Besides that Micro Financial Institution MFI can also become extension of formal financial institution, before fund - for micro finance service - is disbursed to public independent group or that micro business.
The existence of Micro Financial Institution MFI itself also contains 3 three key elements Asian Development Bank and World Bank version.
First, providing various types of financial services - relevant with real need of people served.
Second, serving low income group poor people is major beneficiaries.
Third, using procedure and mechanism that are contextual and flexible, to ease reaching of poor people which need service.
Various phenomena above cause FMI becomes the choice of low class people because it has the characteristic of closed to people.
Namely compatible with daily life rhytm and using simple procedure, not strict to regulation and fast.
Capability to serve customer also requires capability of customer that can manage his finance so can be optimized for the sake of his business scale development.
Most bank feel useless to provide service to them.
It because bank considers service to poor people will incur high transaction cost and full with risk.
Bank tends to serve upper class economy, because this group is considered to be more prospective, nearer, and easier.
Even though taking role as social institution, FMI can become commercial institution through minimization of transaction cost, and playing role as independent public group in coordinating its members.
Due to nearness with customers and flexible regulation, then costs can be reduced.
That disbursement mechanism requires existency of a flanking.
Flank is the key factor to make receiving mechanism works.
To make flanking process sustainable, then required flanking cost.
Parallel with that, poverty alleviation must also be conducted at the smallest region level, but basic function of regional government is still as facilitator, regulator, and motivator.
It means regional government has a very central role because understand more and comprehend potential, challenge, strength and weakness of each region.
Poverty Alleviation Commission PAC is established via each regional regulation and funded via regional budgets according to potentials owned.
It is meant to equalize perception that in embodying development success public must become subject and poverty problem is not merely government business.
In accordance with Regional Autonomy era then regional PAC has a very strategic function, namely as a forum that coordinates all poverty alleviation program either exercised by government or public.
Besides that also as a forum to formulate problems, to execute program, to evaluate and revise existing program.
Relating with regional PAC in poverty alleviation especially for productive poor people, then empowerment and MSMB becomes main priority.
Consequently, empowerment and development of MFI are compatible with locality aspect and characteristic of MFI becomes one of basic requirement.
At least this working partnership can pass two channels.
MFI acts only as distributor and flanking for MSMB that receive credit from bank.
Whereas for bank, executing function is still hold by the bank.
MFI functions as distributor and credit stopper, and bank acts as credit provider.
It means bank provides credit to FMI which later on disbursed to MSMB sector.
This working partnership must be supported by other regional elements.
Whereas, flanking role of MFI can be run by NGO.
All will be distributed as Micro Business Credit, Small Business Credit and Medium Business Credit.
We hereby reported realisation of MSMB credit by August 2002 by 14 systemically Important Bank.
General bank has cashed approval of new credit allotment to MSMB as much as Rp. 24.4 trillions or 88.4% of initial commitment. The number of credit encompasses 1.1 million accounts.
From total approval of the new credit allotment, credit realisation by 14 banks along 2002 until August 2002 reached Rp. 17.4 trillions, or 71% of credit allotment approval during the same period.
From realisation of the new credit, 30.4% is macro credit, 32.1% is small credit, and mostly 37.6% is medium credit.
From spending side, most medium credit is used as working capital credit.
Reaching of micro business credit provision covers poor entrepreneur or near to poor with income around Rp. 500 thousand per household/month.
One of main objectives of development process executed by Indonesian is to increase public welfare either material or spiritual in an equal and fair distribution.
This objective can be achieved if Indonesian nation is able to alleviate poverty.
Besides that MSMB is a sector which is joined by majority of Indonesian society.
MFI empowerment must cover two aspects, namely regulation and institution strengthening aspects.
Regional government has strategic role in poverty alleviation.
The role of micro financial institution in regional autonomy is to move people economy and surmount poverty.
In BRI itself, micro finance is defined as credit service below Rp. 50 millions.
There are still many definition of micro finance depends on discussion angle.
Loan in form of micro credit is a powerful tool in poverty alleviation.
However must be paid attention that when loan is given to they whom are very poor, most likely the loan will never return.
It is common, considering they have no income and have no productive activity.
Food and job creation program is more suitable for that very poor people.
Whereas part of other people categorized as poor but have economic activities or low income people, they have income although not much.
For that required approach, subsidy program or micro loan type which is proper for each poor people category.
Increasing productivity of low class people business in villages.
Increasing income of villagers.
Creating new jobs in villages, so can dampen enthusiasm of villagers to exercise urbanization.
Supporting government program as effort of fair income distribution of villagers and effort of poverty alleviation.
Indonesian Government policy in regional autonomy has influence significantly to government and finance systems.
From centralization to decentralization.
Regional business activity which keeps growing in turn will attract investor to invest its capital in the region, including in this context is micro financial institution and bank.
Their presence is expected will increase business of the region, via various products offered.
Qualification that must be fulfilled by Micro Financial Institution.
Has strong network.
Understanding need of regional government and business of local people.
BRI also provides various services as part of capacity building enhancement of customers.
Among others via customer accessibility enhancement program, Small medium enterprise flanking progam and inclass training.
In order to optimalize regional government income, fund owned by regional government must be managed well so its use can be conducted effectively and even generating incomes.
For that objective BRI offers cooperation in form of cash management, including salary payment.
Activities of BRI in serving middle to low class people.
Performance of BRI is focused on micro and SMB small medium enterprise.
Since established, BRI has mission in people economy development, of which now is reconfirmed by focusing to micro, small and medium business MSMB.
In contrast, corporate credit composition experiences gradual decrease.
Village Credit Institution may be said as historic mark of the establishment of Micro Financial Institution in Indonesia.
By October 2002 there were 4,518 Village Credit Bank VCB distributed at various remote villages in Java Madura and served around 70,000 people.
Service requirements and procedures in VCB are relatively easy and fast.
Customers of VCB are individuals that dwelled in the villages.
Average loan usually is below Rp. 700,000.
BRI as executing bank has exercised credit provision for group below poverty line or called as independent group.
Income enhancement of small farmer-fisher, whose maximum member is 16 people and have received guidance and flanking by extension officer.
The fund originated from BRI dan loan of IFAD and ADB, of which the risk is covered by BRI.
BRI also shared the fund in provision the credit, besides received loan from ADB and IFAD.
Credit arrear up to October 2002 was 6.78%.
P4K credit is distributed gradually, because part of learning process and independency enhancement of KPK, the credit was around Rp. 500,000 up to Rp. 2,000,000 per member.
Maximum KMK credit time frame is 12 months, KI maximum 18 months.
No guarantee of additional collateral in form of certificate or others except the business object funded by credit or freeze saving with value of 10% from the loan.
Besides that they were also obliged to open group saving in advanced for 6 months until reaching 10% of the loan value.
Anyway BRI gave fix interest rate per month to the group.
If compared to commercial interest at BRI branch is 19% per year.
But still lower if compared to BRI micro finance interest rate of 1.5% flat rate per month or 33.2% per year.
For now, BRI is preparing executing guidance to all regions on credit provision to group and association of alliance of several P4K groups.
Now many P4K groups have escaped from poverty line and have received commercial loan from BRI at various regions.
In early 1984, with support of Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia and Bank Indonesia, BRI redesigned the concept of BRI Unit.
The use of commercial approach in fact becomes a new phenomenon of micro financial institution, not only in Indonesia at special, but also for micro finance world in general.
BRI Village Unit which was started in 1984, since 1986 up to 2002 had grown and managed to earn profit.
BRI Village Unit which later was known as BRI Unit now is distributed in 3,902 places at all parts of Indonesia.
Target market of BRI is they who are categorized as the working poor.
With loan value up to Rp. 50 millions, anyway of around 4 millions debtors their average loan is around Rp. 3 millions.
Whereas for saving, now BRI Unit serves around 25 millions depositors all over Indonesia.
With performance record since 1996 up to now, BRI Unit is even known as the most successful Micro Financial Institution, not only in Indonesia but also among other countries in the world.
Main principles adopted tightly so far by BRI Unit Management are as follow:
The system applied in BRI Unit like product, procedure, accountancy system, and supervision are efficient and effective.
BRI Unit is easy to contact and always close to low class people especially the ones in villages or remote areas.
Saving and loan products are designed in such a way so fit with public demand that need it.
To ensure that simplicity principle works properly, then BRI Unit must be managed openly/transparently.
All costs related to BRI Unit activities must be able to be closed with income volume received by BRI Unit.
BRI Unit must be able to generate profit so forth can grow and branch out for its business sustainability.
Every attendant in BRI Unit must receive training to maximize the capability of every employee in order to give the best to customers and company.
BRI Unit runs supervision system procedure mechanism in order to ensure that all employees have exercised their activities according to execution of health banking principles.
BRI Unit always recruits human resources or employees who originate or dwell at local area.
Local people surely will also understand local people characteristics and business.
Utilizing employee originate from local area will also increase relatively high self ownership towards BRI Unit.
Business operational area of BRI Unit is limited by certain region, by doing so control and monitoring level from officers or BRI management and also public is maintained.
Operational procedure is also made standard so easy to understand and fit with local condition.
Product and saving good service SIMPEDES and also loan KUPEDES are made in such a way so very flexible with economy sector strength potential or business owned by the region.
BRI gradually uses information technology from manual way up to sophisticated facilities, such as radio SSB, telephone network, and also online system.
Of almost 4,000 BRI Unit existing throughout Indonesia, now at least all transactions and administration of BRI Unit have used computer facility, server, UPS and printer.
Information technology facility from manual, radio, telephone up to online system is used simultaneously at different regions throughout Indonesia.
That indicates attention and anticipation of BRI on dynamic of era development at each location of BRI Unit.
The technology used is different, but every BRI Unit can contribute profit to BRI.
For years to come BRI keep trying to increase distribution of its fund to micro business, small, and medium.
Up to now, BRI credit expansion has been able to reach the level targeted by government via business plan.
Until the end of 2003 BRI planned to do credit distribution to SME small medium enterprise in amount of Rp. 9.4 trillions from the position on June 2002.
With experience on credit distribution to small business for more than 107 years we expect the target will be able to be embodied well.
This credit scheme is dedicated to support regional government wish in elevating living standar of low class people at its region.
This credit scheme is intended to assist absorption enhancement of KKP by cooperatives where now the absorption is hampered by shortage of collateral that must be provided the cooperatives.
To increase accessibility to BRI, BRI keeps extending networking throughout Indonesia.
On June 2002, BRI has had 4,512 offices that consisted of 322 branch offices, 68 supporting branch offices, 3,902 BRI Units and 220 Village Service Post VSP.
Still in order to increase accessibility of SME to market, BRI also asks various other institutions to develop services to SME, among others is development of SME Center.
The development of SME Center is established altogether with KADIN and TELKOM, not only intended to develop network, E'market place also run as information center as well as education for SMEs.
Currently has been established at nine locations and in the near future with assistance of South Korean Government will be developed at 60 locations.
In development of E'market place network, BRI also cooperates with Agritani, a regional institution.
BRI has also conducted pilot project, flanking program of SME altogether with universities, such as Gadjah Mada University and Udayana University.
In this flanking program, experts from BRI altogether with students joining KKN field work accompanied by their lecturers, accompany activities some SMEs for three months.
During flanking, besides conducting research, the students also give guidance and counseling to small enterprises and guide them.
This flanking program is felt its benefit by SME, so now an continued program is being executed with other big universities.
As has been mentioned, that to achieve optimum result, in the real sector development requires support from all parties, including local government.
In the regional autonomy, with enactment of decentralization in governance and fiscal fields, regional government support is highly expected especially in forms of:
With the stopping of Bank Indonesia liquidity credit flow, regional government is expected can provide sharing replacement liquidity with the enactment of fiscal decentralization policy.
To ease liquidity credit disbursement, regional government can cooperate with banks at the region.
Regional government is also expected can support availability of credit loan facility so can ease bank credit disbursement to real sector.
To enhance accessibility to remote areas and mobility of business world, required sufficient infrastructure availability, such as sea, land, and air transportation.
Development of seaport and airport and communication network.
Accelleration of this infrastructure development is highly possible to reach if part of General Fund Allocation Dana Alokasi Umum is allocated to this field.
Quality of regional bureaucracy also needs to be enhanced in such a way so has paradigm of serving business.
Later on this is reflected in pro business growth through simplicity and clarity in business licensing.
To achieve this matter, it is required a paradigm of regional head as CEO at his/her region.
This change is necessary considering in regional autonomy, regional management responsibility rests with local leaders.
Security is an important factor for business development.
The more fragile a region, regional business development is also hampered, so will increase the risk in the eyes of banking.
Without existence of conducive support as mentioned above will impact to fund management which become not optimum.
The function of micro financial institution as financial intermediary is disturbed among other: low LDR.
Regional capital flight, where investor will withdraw its investation in the region to be shifted to other region whose condition is more conducive towards business development.
Observing BRI performance so far, seems that assets growth and the number of people receiving capital assistance as well as loan amount disbursed keep growing.
It is indicated that potential of micro financial institution establishment in villages is very big.
Still there are much idle money in villages and at the other side also many businessman candidates or people with entrepreneurship spirit but do not have capital and limited access to bank.
The role of micro financial institution in the era of regional autonomy becomes important.
For that micro financial institution should innovate in order to anticipate business opportunity which keeps open, especially in term of accessibility and product/service enhancement.
From existing SMEs there is a lot which lack of capital and management capability of saving-loan is still weak.
Government issued Law or Government Regulation that regulates MFI and obliges every village to establish MFI a kind of BKD.
Management and supervision of MFI are executed by an institution that has experience in managing MFI.
Regional government cooperates with foremost micro financial institutions give training assisting facility to MFI committee and give working capital assistance in form of loan.
Resume of national gathering and Indonesian micro finance development bazaar.
With determination to develop micro finance in framework empowerment of micro business as effort of poverty alleviation with target aiming for and serving 10 million poor people up to 2005. 
Micro Finance Development and empowerment of Micro Financial Institution are accurate steps in order to alleviate poverty and development of people economy.
Because of that is required recognition on existence of micro financial institution as separate entity.
Respecting diversity, uniqueness, and relatedness of micro finance with society development.
Giving recognition and legality to the existence of micro finance and Micro Financial Institution.
Providing protection to public involving in micro finance activity.
Prioritizing micro finance development strategy on basis of joint movement of all parties related with micro finance development.
Developing independent and sustainable flanking, including conducting flanking institution strengthening especially that functions in connecting formal and non-formal sectors.
Combining group and individual approach according to need and acceptance of public.
Developing integration between loan distribution and public saving mobilization, as well as making saving as system base and strength of micro finance.
Reconfirming as well as recognizing and appreciating to meaningful role of woman in every effort of micro finance development.
Developing micro finance supporting institutions as follows:
Institution that can execute protection function on saving and loan.
Inspecting institution, which simultaneously conducts minimum standardization on micro finance practice, supervision, audit, rating, and certification of micro financial institution.
Institution that develops cooperation network among MFIs.
Should be thought for consideration development sort of alternative central bank institution for MFI established by government, Bank Indonesia and association MFIs.
The legal framework must not aim MFI development into banking development lane, because indeed MFI is not bank and not cooperative.
The legal framework must also give tolerance and appreciation to MFI which due to its condition is not possible yet to be controlled in a legal tool and strict law.
For MFI regulation that regulate cooperation between MFI with other financial institution bank and non-bank.
That in KM Draft Law should be put regulation on protection to customer, either saving or loan that does not mean to be flanking.
That KM Draft Law should be clear to put protection to FMI so can be organization from, by, and for local people.
That must be considered capability to do inspection and enforcement on law enacted.
Law and rule that give legality, public protection, as well as basis for MFI development can be embodied immediately.
The future of micro financial institution in Indonesia.
In discussing viability aspect and sustainability, the topics discussed frequently by experts are regulation and supervision of MFI.
This writing screens the essence of issue on regulation and supervision that develop in international world and later on problem currently faced by MFI in Indonesia with way out advices. 
Regulation for MFI which is regulated and supervised whether with applying existing regulation or with special regulation.
If applied existing regulation is for traditional financial institution regular bank. 
For instance supervision on BancoSol in Bolivia is conducted by bank and financial institution supervision authority.
Supervision is conducted by supervising authority based on regulation specially regulate MFI or portofolio micro credit of financial institution.
Regulation itself is conducted by federation based on internal regulation that applied to members.
Hybrid approach, where a third party is assigned to supervise MFI based on approval between supervision authorities with related parties.
As example is Indonesia where supervision on regular bank and BPR Public Credit Bank is conducted by central bank, whereas supervision on BKD is delegated to BRI.
The interesting thing is that the emergence of special regulation for PFF in Bolivia is the result of teaching each other between bank supervisors during supervising BancoSol with BancoSol management.
Whereas discussion on regulation of FMI in the Philippines emerges from initiative of FMI practicioners that feel need nonna for viability and survival of their industry.
Problems of MFI in Indonesia
BKD status which is still hanged the status is BPR but not yet BPR.
Whether exception to those four matter are applicable forever or temporary?
If forever, why not being standardized so not become question which physicologically bother its executioner?
From legal perspective, BKD also faces problem because the legal shapes of BPR allowed according to Banking Law are regional companies, cooperatives, or limited companies.
Will BKD be forced to become cooperative? History has proved the failure to shift BKD as cooperative.
Isn't there any possibility the insititution established based on village consensus is adopted as regional company?
Whereas the article says that banking business is collecting fund from public and providing credit, thus it means LDKP that cannot become BPR may not operate again?
Implication of Halted Function of BI in credit provision and banking supervision.
With withdrawed function of BI in banking supervision at least in 2002, how is the supervision of BKD hereafter?
So far, BRI conducts supervision to BKD based on mandate and especially funding from BI.
The problem becomes serious with rumor that BRI intends to lay off the task due to advice of IMF.
The background of two first problems is: inconsistency in BPR concept adopted by government, so disrupting the existence of MFI post Pakto. 
Among monetary authority seems adopted myth that big financial institution is better writer's opinion in Media Indonesia, May 24, 2000.
PPW activity is aimed for increasing bureaucracy effectivity and increasing regional public participation in planning and executing development at each region.
Village credit system development is one of program components to reduce poverty by involving local people.
Based on each regional regulation, Regional Development Bank RDB is assigned as technical coach, whereas government officer from provincial level up to district acts as coaching body.
Success of LDKP mostly depends on management intensity from RDB at each province with its success in detaching from bureaucracy involvement.
But almost never been seen existency of academicians and internal high rank officers.
Government prefers to develop project or new credit institution, with low interest rate that causing MFI difficult to grow its business, than coaching existing MFI.
The future of Indonesian MFI depends heavily on proper regulation and supervision policy that understands mission hold by MFI and the condition faced. 
The impact of enactment of public credit bank system to village institution performance.
Low morality of executioner apparatus in credit sector.
Low mobilization level of public fund.
The problems indicated basic shortcomings in formulation of conventional credit policy, namely on particulary inaccurate assumption used as policy base.
Meanwhile, in village itself people have been for a long time owned local or traditional financial institutions that serve their needs on principles of self-supporting and market approach.
The institutions are called Village Financial Institution VFI or which recently are more recognized with name Micro Financial Institution MFI.
VFI which become object of this research is people self-supporting group PSCG, Village Credit Agency VCA, and District Credit Agency DCA. 
Bringing implication of working culture change, accountancy system change, organizational structure, and increasing coast which is difficult to adapt by most of VPIs.
If BPR Public Credit Bank system will be fully implemented at VFI, then estimated 90% of all VCA will experience negative margins.
Does not encourage the effectiveness of VFI as financial service institution for poor people in villages because CAMEL criteria do not recognize infrastructure provision and deepening service access.
At initial implementation CAMEL in 1991/1992, the number of DCA loan decreased 11.6%, the number of new loan reduced by 23%, on the other side the number of average loan increased by 26.8%.
It was also indicated that, at least until 1998, Indonesian banking authority had not been touched by micro finance paradigm which had grown at the world outside.
The factors can be effectively implemented as major criteria to evaluate performance of various types of VCI. 
VCA is a healthy and potential model of VFI to be preserved because has several advantages, namely:
Potential to develop voluntary saving and access to depositors,
Quite selective its mechanism of loan provision,
Strong social relationship in reducing arrears.
Consistent in deepening service to poor people, and
Responsive to effort and policy of enhancing performance,
PSCG has constraint in enhancing its performance because limited number of members so hamper access extension to depositors.
This constraint has been overcomed by extending PSCG whose activity is only saving-loan to become joint business that exercise other productive activity, so can increase profit.
From exogen variable influence towards VFI performance can be explained that:
General correlation of VFI to service reach discloses negative influence of cheap credits from government that causing VFI difficult to extend its service access.
Correlation between customer incomes with service access factor indicates there is still honest character at villagers.
The bigger their income, the more probability they save, the less probability they will borrow and be in arrears.
Micro finance is one of effective ways of alleviating poverty and moving people economy.
Mrs. Sri, with age around 40 years, lives in Sragen village Central Java, is a business woman of humble food stall. 
One day must borrowed money of Rp. 1 million from shark-loan.
Every month she must pay Rp. 100,000, but the loan is never settled because the interest is 10% per month.
Thus the Rp. 100,000 that she pays so far only the interest, whereas the capital is never paid.
Then on her friend offer, she joined a group of micro business women, which is recognized with name PSCG People Self-Capability Group.
After the group is considered quite solid, by its flank is given an opportunity to start borrowing to Micro Financial Institution, Rp. 1 million each.
By Mrs. Sri the loan is used to settle fully all her debt to shark-loan.
Then every month Mrs. Sri keeps paying Rp. 100,000 to her group, and after 12 times installments her debt is settled.
Mrs. Sri is very grateful and since then her income increases by Rp. 100,000 every month, because her debt is settled.
That is micro finance; with Rp. 1 million can change the life of Mrs. Sri and her family.
She indeed does not have access to financial institution such as bank, because does not have collateral or saving.
The only access is to shark-loan, and it means she will become poorer all her life, because of high interest rate 10 - 20% every month.
How many people like Mrs. Sri in Indonesia.
Namely poor people, but have businesses which are very small.
Each institution uses different criteria, so poverty numbers are always criss cross.
Globally, there is a kind of understanding about poverty that can be accepted and understood one another, namely if the income is less than US$ 1 per day per individu.
Let us see the experience of Mrs. Sari in Parung Village, Bogor.
Her husband works as driver, and she herself is a daily need vegetable seller, takes place at her house.
Every morning, while other people are still sleeping tight, at 02.00 until 04.00, accompanied by her husband she buys vegetables at Parung market.
She selects vegetables and daily food, with variety and volume which are predicted to be sold at the same day.
Left over that cannot be sold is consumed by her family, or given to less fortunate people as gift, because cannot be sold in the following day.
But this family does not want to consider their income is Rp. 2 millions per month.
But their income is more than US$ 1 per individual per day.
So they are not poor people.
Micro business has profit or profit margin which is quite high.
For example go around vegetable seller at housing complex.
But customers are satisfied, because do not need to go to market or super market and may buy as much as needed, thus win-win.
That fund loan is generally needed as additional working capital.
Let alone if income goes down, used to fullfil life need, so working capital depletes.
Here micro finance plays role to save them from poverty.
If the working capital is sufficient, then other urgent needs will follow, for instance children tuition fees.
They really know their responsibilities as parents, to provide good education to their beloved children.
So, without realizing that we have explained many aspects of micro finance, and its role in poverty alleviation.
Micro finance is an alternative which is very needed for micro businesses, because they do not have access to formal financial institution. 
Micro Financial Institution MFI that provides sustainable funding and the fund gets bigger.
Micro Business Flanking Institution MBPI, which sustainably accompanying micro business groups as well one by one of group's members.
Business motivation and spirit can be well maintained, and they can learn each other. 
Saving habit can be well managed and developed.
And if saving amount has been sufficient, member can borrow from his group.
By grouping, then transaction cost for MFI and LPUM becomes light.
Individual service to micro business will require very high transaction cost.
Therefrom micro finance can play role to alleviate poverty, not for all poverties, but limited only to poor people which have businesses economically active poor.
But do not forget, the number of this micro finance is very big.
Other poverty such as: elder people, jobless people, terlantar children, must be overcomed with other effective ways.
Another aspect of micro finance is its ability to move people economy.
If there are 1,000 villages, then impact of Rp. 1.5 trillions fund towards economy in villages and nationally will certainly be felt.
There are villages where villagers positions like individuals that stand in water up to their necks, so even little ripple should be enough to drown them.
Poverty keeps becoming phenomenal problem along Indonesian history as nation state, history of a country which wrong in viewing and managing poverty.
In country which is mismanaged, there is no bigger problem than poverty problem.
Village agricultural workers work all day, but they receive very little payments.
Poverty becomes perfect reason of low Human Development Index HDI, Indeks Pembangunan Manusia Indonesia.
In total quality of Indonesian people is still relatively very low, compared with quality of people in other countries in the world.
Based on Human Development Report 2004 which used data of year 2002, the point of Indonesian Human Development Index is 0.692.
In short, poverty is very complex and chronic problem.
From educational dimension for instance, low education is considered as cause of poverty.
From health dimension, low public health quality causes poverty to exist.
From economic dimension, ownership of productive equipment which is limited, technology mastery and lack of skill, seen as basic reason why poverty exist.
Cultural and structural factors are also frequently seen as important element that determines public prosperity and welfare level.
This approach determines rigidly income standard of someone in the society to differentiate his social class.
Limitation of this capability causes opportunity closing for poor people to involve in decision making.
Subjective approach evaluates poverty based on opinion or visions of the poor itself Joseph F. Stepanek, ed, 1985.
Limited sufficiency and food quality, seen from limited food stock, low calori intake of poor people and poor nutrition status of baby, kids under 5 years old, and mother.
Around 20 percents people with the lowest income level only consume 1.571 kcal per day.
Deficiency of calory intake, namely less than 2,100 kkal per day, is still suffered by 60 percents of low income people BPS, 2004.A US military gunship launched air raids against hideouts of members of the Al-Qaeda network in southern Somalia, hitting right on target, the Somali government said Tuesday.
We know that a US gunship raided targets of Al-Qaeda in southern Somalia sometime yesterday afternoon, government spokesman Abdirahman Dinari told AFP, confirming reports by US television channels.
The target was a small village called Badel where the terrorists were hiding. 
And the gunship did hit on the exact target, Dinari said, adding that Somali and Ethiopian troops were nearby.
Dinari said there were casualities from the raids, which, according to US television reports, were carried out by a AC-130 gunship, operated by the US Special Operations Command, that flew from its base in Djibouti for the attack.
Absolutely a lot of people were killed. 
So many dead people were lying in the area, but we do not know who is who, but the raid was a success, Dinari said.
But US Defense Department spokesman, Todd Vician, was unable to confirm the reports.
The attacks come more than a week after joint Ethiopian and Somali troops routed the Islamists, accused of ties to Al-Qaeda, from their final stronghold in the southern port town of Kismayo, forcing them to flee into scrublands along the border with Kenya.
The targets of the raids included the senior Al-Qaeda leader in East Africa and an Al-Qaeda operative wanted for his involvement in the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
At the embassy attacks, Al-Qaeda militants, using materials smuggled through Somalia, blew up the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people and injuring thousands.
And attacks in 2002 on an Israeli airliner and Israeli-owned hotel in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa also came from Somalia, US officials said.
Hundreds of supporters of former home affairs minister Rogerio Lobato rallied Tuesday in East Timor outside the court where he was due to go on trial on weapons distribution charges.
Lobato has been charged with involvement in arming civilians during unrest last year.
A panel of one local and two UN judges first questioned one of Lobato's co-defendants, Marcos Piedade alias Labadaen, and was due to hear from Lobato at 2:00 pm (0500 GMT).
Some 300 of his supporters from the ruling Fretilin party rallied in front of the Dili Appeal Court in a show of support for the former minister before the hearing even started.
The protestors, who arrived on dozens of trucks, buses and motorcycles, waved Fretilin flags and shouted Long live Rogerio Lobato, Long live Fretilin,.
 as some 50 UN and local police stood guard in and around the court building
Lobato is one of the founders of Falintil, the armed wing of the then pro-independence Fretilin movement which fought against Indonesian occupation and later turned into a political party.
We rally here at our own initiative
To show support for Rogerio Lobato. 
He is one of the founders of the Fretilin and we will continue to protest in Dili until his trial ends, protester Mariano Andre told journalists outside the court building.
Lobato, Piedave and the two other defendants, Francisco Salsinha and Francisco Xavier Diegas, face charges of involvement in arming civilians during the violence that erupted in Dili in April and May.
Following protests over the dismissal of some 600 soldiers.
A report from a UN inquiry into the violence said former prime minister Mari Alkatiri and Lobato were among officials who should be investigated over possible involvement in the distribution of weapons.
Some 37 people were left dead in pitched battles between security forces during bloody street violence. 
More than 150,000 people fled their homes and some 3,200 Australian-led peacekeepers were deployed in May to restore calm.
Their numbers have since been reduced to around 1,100.
East Timor gained independence in 2002 after a period of UN stewardship. It was ruled by Indonesia for 24 years before its people voted overwhelmingly in 1999 in favour of breaking away from Jakarta.
Taliban militants in southern Afghanistan abducted four employees of a peace commission trying to persuade the extremists to side with the government, police said Sunday.
The four were working for the national reconciliation programme, an amnesty scheme launched by President Hamid Karzai's administration in 2004 in a bid to win over the Taliban.
They were on their way from the southern province of Uruzgan to Kandahar late Saturday when their vehicle was stopped by gunmen close to the Uruzgan capital, Tirin Kot, provincial deputy police chief Mohammad Nabi told AFP.
The armed Taliban kidnapped the three peace workers and their driver after they set fire to their vehicle close to Tirin Kot, said Nabi.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the abduction.
It was similar to scores of others by remnants of the Taliban regime who were forced from power in late 2001 in a US-led offensive and are now waging a deadly insurgency.
Criminal gangs and factions are also involved in kidnappings.
More than 2,000 Taliban rebels and other Islamic fighters have accepted the olive branch offered by the amnesty programme, which however excludes the Taliban's leaders, including the extremists' chief, Mullah Mohammad Omar.
At least 53 people were killed when a train traveling to Pakistan caught fire early Monday in northern India, the Associated Press reported quoting a railroad official.
An explosive device was found near the track where the fire occurred, AP quoted V.N. Mathur, general manager of the Northern Railway, as saying.
The fire engulfed two coaches of the Samjhauta Express, one of two train links between India and Pakistan.
The train was traveling from New Delhi to Atari, the last railroad station before the border with Pakistan, AP reported.
Two bombs exploded aboard a train bound from India to Pakistan burning to death at least 64 passengers, officials said on Monday.
With India's government labelling the attack an act of terror.
Most of the victims were Pakistanis but included some Indians, officials said.
Two other unexploded homemade bombs were also found on the train and the track, with television pictures showing one of them, a large plastic suitcase with wires and a plastic bottle attached.
Officials said the bottle contained some kind of flammable liquid and the apparent intention had been to cause a fire.
This is what it suggests, that it was an act of terror, India's prime minister's spokesman, Sanjaya Baru, told Reuters.
About 50 passengers were also reported wounded. 
Television pictures showed blackened and gutted carriages, with the heat of the fire having peeled the paint off the carriage exteriors.
it's an act of terrorism like the one in Mumbai, Railways Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav told reporters, referring to serial bomb blasts in Mumbai last July that killed 186 people.
We have recovered two suitcases with dangerous explosive devices, he said.
The coaches of the Samjhauta Express train, which connects New Delhi to the northern Pakistani city of Lahore, erupted in fire near Panipat town, about 80 km (50 miles) north of the Indian capital, around midnight on Sunday (1830 GMT).
Many of the windows were barred with iron rods, meaning many people were trapped inside the train. 
One survivor said passersby pulled some survivors out of one of the few windows that did not have rods.
I took a visa to come to India and see relatives, but I never realised it would become the last journey for my family, said Tara Chand, whose three sons and two daughters are missing and feared dead after the blasts.
He was returning to Pakistan after a month in India.
I heard a loud explosion and then it was all smoke, he said. 
Looking at the intensity of the smoke, many people must have suffocated to death before being charred.
The incident comes days before Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri is due in New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders to push forward a slow-moving peace process between the old rivals.
Most of the people are Pakistanis, but the casualties did include some Indian security personnel, the chief secretary of the Haryana state government Prem Prashant told Reuters.
Pakistan's government said it was in touch with Indian authorities and was collecting information, confirming that most of the dead were Pakistani.
Bob Woodward, the US journalist who helped break the Watergate scandal, called Wednesday on reporters to take more time on stories after the US media's handling of the run-up to the Iraq war.
The celebrated Washington Post reporter said the media should have done more to verify whether Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had secret weapons as alleged by US President George W. Bush as a reason to go to war.
We should have been much more aggressive, Woodward told a conference in Tokyo. 
I've thought what I could have done, he said. 
The only way to find out if (weapons of mass destruction) really existed is to get on the ground.
But he said the round-the-clock deadlines of the modern media were hampering investigative journalism.
It's a crazy media environment. 
We need to slow it down. 
We need weeks, months or even years to work on stories, Woodward said.
Woodward and Carl Bernstein broke the story of the 1972 break-in at the Democratic Party office in the Watergate Hotel, ultimately leading to the resignation of US president Richard Nixon.
Woodward's latest book, State of Denial, takes a critical look at Bush's invasion of Iraq.
The real impulse is to make the government accountable so we do not get a secret government, Woodward said.
The nightmare is that the president gets so closed off, so secretive, so convinced they are doing the right thing or just unable to face the possibility that they've made a very, very serious mistake, he said.
Three Kurdish Iraqi children are being treated in an Israeli hospital near Tel Aviv, the Israeli Ynet website reported Thursday night.
The three siblings were born with heart defects and require various surgeries. 
They will be operated on in the coming weeks after undergoing examinations.
The children arrived with their mother through the aid of a local charity, after waiting for two and a half months in Jordan for permission to enter Israel.
The website said that five Iraqi children have been operated on so far in the Israeli hospital.
Iraq and Israel do not have diplomatic relations.
A group linked to Al-Qaeda in Iraq said on Friday it has killed 18 policemen it kidnapped in Diyala province, and blamed their deaths on the Baghdad government for ignoring its demands.
The Islamic state of Iraq gave the government of (Prime Minister Nuri) al-Maliki 24 hours to meet its demands if the 18 interior ministry workers who were arrested in Diyala were to be released, it said in a statement posted on the Internet.
But the Maliki government, as usual... did not care for their lives... so the Islamic courts ordered the execution of those apostates... who have deemed the blood and honour of Sunnis as permissible, added the statement, whose authenticity could not be verified.
It said that a videotape showing the policemen being killed would be released soon.
Iraqi security forces on Friday found 11 bodies of their murdered comrades in the Sunni Arab restive town of Baquba in Diyala province, after Al-Qaeda threatened to kill police hostages in revenge for the alleged rape of a Sunni woman.
Earlier, an alliance of Sunni armed groups in Iraq, led by Al-Qaeda, posted pictures on the Internet that it said showed 18 kidnapped interior ministry employees from Diyala, some of them wearing police uniforms.
The mayor of Khalis, the murdered officers' hometown in Diyala province, north of Baghdad, said the 11 bodies were found in the streets.
Their throats had been cut and their hands were bound, Uday al-Khadran said.
Mortar rounds crashed into Somalia's presidential palace on Tuesday hours after President Abdullahi Yusuf flew back into the chaotic coastal capital Mogadishu.
Yusuf's interim government voted overwhelmingly on Monday to move to the city, which has been rocked by near-daily insurgent attacks blamed on an Islamist movement defeated two months ago.
We saw several mortars flying over us towards the palace, said one woman who lives nearby and asked not to be named.
Residents said government troops and their Ethiopian allies based at the hilltop Villa Somalia compound immediately returned fire with artillery guns. 
At least three areas in the city were said to have been hit, but details were scarce.
In other violent incidents in Mogadishu on Tuesday, a remote controlled bomb -- the first known use of such a device in Somalia's insurgency -- destroyed the car of a city official, although it was unclear if he was in the vehicle at the time.
Police cordoned off the site of the blast and stopped journalists from viewing the wreckage.
Elsewhere, residents said two civilians were killed and three wounded when Ethiopian troops opened fire after their convoy was ambushed by gunmen.
Yusuf, who has been out of Mogadishu for about a month, returned to the capital earlier on Tuesday amid tight security.
His administration is anxious to impose its authority on the whole of the Horn of Africa country after being confined to the south central town of Baidoa since its creation in 2004.
Its Ethiopian allies are to make way for African Union troops who began arriving in Mogadishu last week. 
More than 1,000 Ugandans have landed, and been attacked at least twice.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana arrived in Syria on Wednesday on his first visit in two years to hold talks with President Bashar al-Assad aimed at easing the political crisis in Lebanon.
His trip is the latest in a string of visits by Western officials that Damascus characterises as proof of its indisputable role as a key player in the Middle East region.
Official EU contacts with Syria have been frozen since former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri's assassination in a massive bomb blast in Beirut February 2005, an attack widely blamed on Damascus.
Solana has said he was mandated to tell the Syrians what the situation is... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community, particularly on the Lebanon issue.
He will stress to Assad the advantages for Damascus of playing a constructive role, according to a European diplomat. 
The aim is to have Syria adopt a more flexible, more cooperative attitude on Lebanon.
Solana told reporters in Beirut on Monday he would hold frank discussions on Syria's troubled relations with Lebanon, where many people blame Damascus for a series of deadly bomb attacks.
He also said he would address the issue of the UN tribunal due to try suspects in the Hariri murder.
The anti-Syrian parliamentary majority in Lebanon has accused Damascus of blocking the creation of the tribunal, and a string of pro-Syrian cabinet ministers resigned last November over the issue, setting off an acute political crisis.
On a visit to Cairo, Syrian Vice President Faruq al-Shara the tribunal was accepted by all parties in Lebanon and should not be used as a sword of Damocles nor should it be politicised.
Solana said he will also raise with Assad the question of alleged arms smuggling from Syria into Lebanon.
The European Union hopes Solana's visit will help ease the crisis in Lebanon, sharply divided between pro- and anti-Syrian camps since Hariri's murder forced Syria to end its military domination of the country.
Solana said the European Union wanted to see if we can resume our relations with Syria.
We will have to discuss the change of behaviour.
French President Jacques Chirac, a close friend of Hariri, had blocked all overtures for talks.
EU officials acknowledge privately they have been looking for a way to resume talks with Syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of Iran, which, like Damascus, holds sway over Hezbollah.
After kicking off his tour in Beirut, Solana on Tuesday held talks in Saudi Arabia, which is working to host a reconciliation meeting next week between the rival Lebanese camps, according to Arab diplomatic sources.
The state-controlled Syrian press on Tuesday pointed to what it said was Damascus's important standing in the region, stressing its refusal to budge under international pressure.
It is clear that Syria cannot be isolated; to the contrary, its role is being recognised, said Ath-Thawra. Syria has not changed its policies, which have turned out to be valid.
Solana's visit follows on the heels of a trip by a senior US official, the highest-level visit from Washington to Damascus in two ears which involved  talks limited to the Iraqi refugee crisis.
Ellen Sauerbrey, assistant secretary of state for refugees and migration, discussed the plight of the refugees, who now number About two million among Iraq's neighbours, including between 600,000 and one million in Syria.
Syria's press hailed her visit as a vindication of the government's approach to Middle East peace.
The visits to Damascus by international officials are a form of public recognition of the solid basis of Syria's vision, Ath-Thawra said.
Rwanda's troops could pull out of the African Union peacekeeping force in Sudan's Darfur region because of a lack of proper support, President Paul Kagame warned in an interview broadcast Wednesday.
Our forces there are not ill-trained but they are ill-supported by those who are supposed to do so, Kagame told the government station Radio Rwanda. 
If our presence there is not making a difference on the ground, then I don't see the purpose of remaining there.
We are evaluating the situation of the mission and very soon, we will pronounce ourselves on the matter, he added.
Kagame said the AU had still not repaid money that his central African nation had spent to maintain troops in Darfur, but stressed this was not the main consideration.
Rwanda has 2,000 soldiers in the 7,000-strong AU presence in Darfur, but the force has been already criticised for having failed to stop the bloodshed in the region.
The war in Darfur erupted in February 2003 when armed rebels from minority tribes in the region, where people of black African origin are dominated by the Arab population, called for an equal share of power and national resources.
That prompted a brutal crackdown from Sudanese government forces and their Janjaweed proxy militia which, according to UN estimates, has killed 200,000 people and forced 2.5 million people from their homes.
The root of the problem faced by the AU force has been a chronic shortage of equipment and weapons -- and the means to pay for them.
For several months now the United Nations has been negotiating with Sudanese president Omar al-Beshir over the modalities of a hybrid AU-UN force that would replace the AU force.
Beshir has insisted that the African Union (AU) must remain in control of any joint peacekeeping mission.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that Iran's seizure of 15 Royal Navy personnel was unjustified and wrong, and expressed the hope they would be free in a few days.
Blair told a press conference in Berlin that the Britons were in Iraqi waters when they were detained at gunpoint by Iran's Revolutionary Guard on Friday.
The prime minister, who was in the German capital for ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the EU, said Britain wanted to settle the issue by diplomatic means.
The Iranian government had to realize the matter was of fundamental importance to the British government, he said, describing the situation as serious.
The servicemen were detained after inspecting a vessel in the Gulf's Shatt al-Arab. 
Iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters, but Britain said they were in Iraqi waters and demanded their release.
US Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad held talks last year with presumed representatives of leading Iraqi insurgent groups in a bid to lure militant Iraqi Sunnis into the country's political process, The New York Times reported on its website Sunday. 
There were discussions with the representatives of various groups in the aftermath of the elections, and during the formation of the government before the Samarra incident, and some discussions afterwards as well, Khalilzad told The Times in an interview Friday. 
The newspaper said he is the first US official to publicly acknowledge holding such talks. 
The meetings began in early 2006 and were possibly the first attempts at sustained contact between senior US officials in Baghdad and the Sunni Arab insurgency, the report said.
Khalilzad flew to Jordan for some of the talks, which included self-identified representatives of the Islamic Army of Iraq and the 1920 Revolution Brigades, two leading nationalist factions, the paper said.
Khalilzad declined to give details on the meetings, but other officials said the efforts had foundered by the summer, after the bombing of a revered Shiite shrine in Samarra, according to the report.
Khalilzad's willingness even to approach rebel groups defied the public position of some Bush administration officials that the United States does not negotiate with insurgents, The Times said.
In another sign of pragmatism, the ambassador reiterated his position that the American and Iraqi governments had to consider granting amnesty to insurgents, the report said. 
This is something that we and Iraqis, the government, will do together, and there are various types of amnesties, he said. 
But the fundamental point, the goal of bringing the war to an end, the most important tribute we could pay to our soldiers who have lost their lives here would be that the cause they  fought for would be embraced and accepted by their former enemies, by those who fought them. 
Khalilzad, who has been nominated by President George W. Bush to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, leaves Iraq this week. 
Sri Lanka's national carrier on Monday urged travellers to check on rescheduled flights before heading to the island's only international airport after a rebel air raid forced it to shut down briefly.
Sri Lankan Airlines said that many incoming and outbound flights had been rescheduled following the Tamil Tiger raid on a military airbase adjacent to the civilian facility, which left three airmen dead and 16 others wounded.
The Colombo BIA Airport re-opened to all traffic at 3:30 am (2200 GMT). 
All Sri Lankan Airlines aircraft and passengers and staff remain unharmed, the flag carrier said in a statement.
Officials said at least four inbound flights were diverted to neighbouring India's southern city of Chennai.
Sri Lanka's foreign ministry spokesman Ravinatha Aryasinha said operations at the airport were not affected by the Tiger raid.
There is no damage to the international airport or the runway, Aryasinha said. 
Flights were suspended only as a precautionary measure.
Montenegrin Foreign Minister Milan Rocen will arrive in Russia on his first official visit. 
He will have talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday, March 27.
The foreign ministers intend to exchange views in detail on several international issues of mutual interest, an official at the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
They will discuss the situation in the Balkans, and, in this respect, the development of events in the process of defining Kosovo's status.
The sides will consider the issues of multilateral cooperation in South-Eastern Europe.
The negotiations will highlight possibilities for expanding economic cooperation. 
The current small trade does not meet the reached level of political relations and the existing potential in economy, the official emphasized.
Meanwhile, the Russian business quarters showed growing interest recently in the investments in the Montenegrin economy, he pointed out.
Moscow believes Milan Rocen's visit very important, the official remarked. 
The visit is designed to give a fresh impetus to development of cooperation in various spheres in view of Montenegro's recent getting the status of independent state.
Russian-Montenegrin relations have the history of many centuries and are based on firm brotherly ties that unite the peoples of our countries.
In the recent years cooperation between Russia and Montenegro has been developing actively in all directions. 
The political dialogue on top and high levels is prioritized in our relations, the official remarked.
Russia, which was the first country among the leading world powers to recognize independence of Montenegro, established diplomatic relations with the country, gave and keeps giving support to this country in its development as a full-fledged entity of international relations, the official noted. 
We consider Montenegro as one of the key partners in the Balkans, he said.
Milan Rocen will meet with State Duma Speaker Boris Gryzlov, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Alexy II. 
He is also expected to meet with Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu, as they are the co-chairmen of the intergovernmental committee on trade, economic and scientific-technical cooperation. 
Milan Rocen will also meet with Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
Egyptians trickled to polling stations on Monday to vote on controversial constitutional changes in the face of a boycott by the opposition which accuses the regime of trying to curb basic freedoms.
Information Minister Anas al-Fiqi said nationwide turnout stood between 23 and 27 percent but other estimates said it did not exceed 10 percent.
The vote on the controversial amendments, which were rushed through the ruling party-dominated parliament only a week ago, was boycotted by a united opposition front and drew rare US criticism of key regional ally Egypt.
The day was also marked by general voter apathy and disillusionment.
What's the use? All referendums are fixed, said 50-year-old Abdallah as he drove his taxi through downtown Cairo, where police in riot gear and others in plainclothes were heavily deployed.
Egyptians know what's going on but we can't say anything or we'll be arrested and put in jail.
Most voters seen at polling stations were government workers granted a break by their employers to cast their ballot, or people gathered from impoverished neighbourhoods by the ruling party.
This does not look like a popular Egyptian vote, Ghada Shahbender from the independent monitoring group Shayfeencom told AFP.
It is a referendum by President (Hosni) Mubarak and his NDP, and only their people showed up.
The independent Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights estimated the turnout in Monday's vote at around five percent, while the opposition Islamists offered a figure of seven to nine percent.
The regime says the amendments fulfil Mubarak's promise for democratic change and are crucial to the security of the Arab world's most populous country and the entire region.
The amendments will give a push to the activities of (political) parties will end trading in religion and illegitimate political activity, and protect the nation from the dangers of terrorism, he said in a televised address.
Critics have lambasted them as a major setback for basic freedoms and a bid by the regime to put a lid on the Islamist opposition's growing popularity while ensuring a smooth transition of power from Mubarak to his son Gamal.
No referendum can legitimise these constitutional amendments, or bring them in compliance with Egypt's international obligations, said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, whose administration has been accused of easing its pressure on Egypt to reform, voiced deep concern.
While most of the 34 articles being amended simply remove references to socialism, some changes also allow the authorities to arrest terrorism suspects without a warrant and refer them to military courts and reduce judicial oversight of elections.
One amendment bans political activity based on religion.
The Muslim Brotherhood, which sees itself as the main target of the changes, called for a boycott, arguing that the regime will tamper with the results anyway.
One of the aims of the amendments is to eliminate all possible political activity by the Muslim Brotherhood, said Mustafa Kamel Al Sayyed, professor of political science at the American University in Cairo.
They would also prevent an independent candidate from running in the next presidential elections... whether they are Muslim Brotherhood or not, he said in an interview.
Small groups of protesters waved banners denouncing the referendum and calling for a boycott from inside the grounds of the Bar Association and the Journalists' Union in downtown Cairo amid tight security.
We have had no reports of incidents, clashes or arrests, Fiqi said after polling closed.
He added that results could be announced Tuesday.
Pop singer Elton John should be banned from performing at a jazz festival in Tobago because his homosexuality could influence young people, some Christian leaders on the Caribbean island said on Monday.
A group of Christian churches have failed to persuade the Tobago House of Assembly, which oversees the administration of the island, to join the call for a boycott of John's appearance at the Plymouth Jazz Festival in late April.
But they said they would pursue the campaign against John, who married his partner David Furnish in Britain in 2005.
We feel it can have a negative social impact. 
There are some who may not be sure of their sexuality and one has to be careful about how this can create impressions on impressionable minds, pastor Terrance Baynes told Reuters on Monday.
The British singer celebrated his 60th birthday at Madison Square Garden in New York on Sunday, playing more than 30 songs from a career spanning four decades.
Jazz festival organizer CL Communications dismissed calls for a boycott and said the show would go on.
Elton John is coming as what he is, one of the world's greatest performers, said Anthony Maharaj, adding that the country should be honored to have John perform in Tobago, the smaller island of energy-rich Trinidad.
His band has performed in every country around the world. 
He is not coming here to preach about what lifestyle people should have, he said.
They said an army unit entered the old city of Nablus, a hideout for militants, seeking to arrest wanted Palestinians and engaged some in a gun battle.
Two militants, identified as Ala Ghalith, 25, and Muhannad Mreish, 24, members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the military wing of Fatah movement, were shot and died before Palestinian ambulances were able to reach them.
Hospital sources said they arrived there dead.
Vice President Dick Cheney accused U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday of bad behavior on her Middle East trip, saying she bungled a message for Syria's president that was later clarified by Israel.
Cheney harshly criticized Pelosi's visit to Syria this week and declared in an interview, The president is the one who conducts foreign policy, not the speaker of the House.
Pelosi's Syrian stopover was opposed from the start by the Bush administration, which accuses Damascus of sponsoring terrorism and says it should be isolated from the international community.
While in Damascus on Wednesday, Pelosi announced she had told Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that Israel was prepared to negotiate with Syria. 
That prompted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office to underline the Jewish state's preconditions for such talks -- including that Syria abandon its support for terrorist groups.
Cheney, pointing to the Israeli reaction, said it was obvious Olmert had not authorized the message Pelosi delivered.
It was a non-statement, nonsensical statement and didn't make any sense at all that she would suggest that those talks could go forward as long as the Syrians conducted themselves as a prime state sponsor of terror, the vice president said on the Rush Limbaugh radio show.
I think it is, in fact bad behavior on her part. 
I wish she hadn't done it, Cheney said. 
Fortunately I think the various parties involved recognize she doesn't speak for the United States in those circumstances, she doesn't represent the administration.
Pelosi's spokesman, Brendan Daly, asked to respond to Cheney's criticism, said the speaker accurately relayed the message from Olmert to Assad.
The tough and serious message the speaker relayed was that, in order for Israel to engage in talks with Syria, the Syrian government must eliminate its links with extremist elements, including Hamas and Hezbollah, Daly said.
Referring to the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, and Lebanon's Hezbollah, which Israel fought in a war last year.
Pelosi's decision to defy the White House and meet Assad stepped up a tug of war between the Democratic-led Congress and Republican President George W. Bush over foreign policy.
The two sides are already doing battle over Iraq policy, with Democrats trying to force Bush to accept a date for withdrawing U.S. troops.
Pelosi was also slammed on Thursday by a Washington Post editorial that was headlined Pratfall in Damascus and called her Middle East shuttle diplomacy foolish.
A roadside bomb blast killed one more US soldier and wounded two others in the restive Diyala province, north of Baghdad, the military reported Friday.
The soldier died on Thursday when the bomb exploded near his vehicle.
The latest fatality brought the military's losses in Iraq since the invasion to 3,262, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
Sudanese Foreign Minister Lam Akol reiterated on Saturday that the United Nations should only play a logistical role supporting African Union troops in Darfur.
We will not renegotiate, Akol told Reuters when asked whether his country would accept the deployment of U.N. troops in the violence-plagued region.
Sudan has rebuffed international demands to allow the deployment of a large U.N. force, saying supporting the under-funded and ill-equipped 7,000-strong AU force would be enough to stabilise the region.
At the heart of the debate with Western powers is the outcome of a November meeting in Addis Ababa. 
The United Nations says Khartoum agreed then to a three-phase plan that would end with a hybrid AU-U.N. operation in Darfur.
Sudan said it only agreed to the first two phases of U.N. logistical and financial support. 
Akol said on Saturday his country was not about to review its position.
He was speaking after the arrival of African Union Chairman Alpha Oumar Konare for talks with Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
Experts estimate that 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million fled their homes in Darfur since the conflict flared in 2003 when rebels took up arms against the central government.
Khartoum says only 9,000 died.
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates on Tuesday was to meet Jordan's King Abdullah II on a tour aimed at rallying support for Iraq's government and countering Iran's growing influence in the Middle East.
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process was also to figure high on the agenda, a senior Defence Department official said on condition of anonymity ahead of the meeting.
While Jordan only has a small military hospital in neighbouring Iraq, it helps train Iraqi police, air force personnel and air traffic controllers at schools in the kingdom.
King Abdullah said in an interview with AFP that Israel must end its occupation of Arab land if it wants to co-exist with the world's Muslims.
He also warned against a hasty US withdrawal from Iraq without setting a timetable and without preparing the necessary conditions that would ensure a strong central government able to run the affairs of the state.
The foreign ministers of Jordan and Israel met in Amman on Sunday for talks on ways to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
They also discussed ways to restart Israeli-Palestinians peace talks, following a meeting earlier the same day in Jerusalem between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
Gates, who held talks with Jordan's armed forces chief, General Khalid al-Sarayreh, is expected to travel on to Egypt and Israel, reinforcing US support for its allies in the region.
Washington wants its Arab allies Jordan and Egypt to show more public support for the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
The United States is also seeking greater Arab public opposition to Iran's controversial nuclear programme and to Iranian support for the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon.
Washington has accused Iran of fomenting sectarian violence in Iraq and supporting anti-US insurgents in the country.
High body levels of oxygen, also known as hyperoxia, induced by oxygen therapy may depress breathing in newborns, according to the findings of an animal study published in the European Respiratory Journal.
Previous studies have suggested that frequent hyperoxia could compromise the ability of tissue to absorb oxygen, particularly in preterm infants, who are more susceptible to stop breathing, referred to as apnea, the authors explain.
Dr. F. Lofaso from Hopital Raymond Poincare, Garches, France and colleagues investigated the effects of repeated hyperoxia on the breathing response of newborn mice with a condition similar to that seen in preterm infants.
Repeated hyperoxia caused breathing to slow down. 
Furthermore, hypoxia was associated with an increase in the duration of apnea.
The good news is that these effects could be reversed after several minutes of breathing regular air.
The findings support a need for stringent control of oxygen therapy, most notably repeated oxygen administration in the neonatal period for premature infants and those carried to term, they conclude.
Infants on oxygen therapy should at least have their blood oxygen levels monitored to prevent it from dropping too low or becoming too high, Lofaso told Reuters Health. 
These study findings should also be considered in the debate over how useful or harmful oxygen administration is during the resuscitation of newborns.
Sudan and rebel groups have agreed to a 60-day ceasefire in Darfur on the basis of a peace agreement reached in Nigeria last May, a senior US politician said on Wednesday.
US New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson told a news conference at the end of a four-day visit that President Omar al-Beshir had agreed to his delegation's proposal for a truce in the war-torn western region of the country.
Beshir, with whom the governor held two meetings, agreed to the truce as long as it in goes in line with the DPA, the Darfur peace agreement signed in Abuja on May 5, according to Richardson.
Both sides agreed there was a compelling need for a comprehensive ceasefire to launch a political process based on the DPA that would lead to a durable end to the conflict as soon as possible, said a joint statement distributed to reporters at a press conference in Khartoum.
Both agreed to a 60-day cessation of hostilities by all parties within the framework of the DPA, it said.
Richardson, heading a delegation made up of the Save Darfur Coalition, also held talks with Foreign Minister Lam Akol and visited Darfur where he met with government and humanitarian officials as well as rebel faction leaders.
The joint statement issued by Khartoum and the US team said the United Nations and African Union would embark on efforts aimed at narrowing the gaps between the government and rebel groups which refused to sign the peace deal.
Five people including the attacker and a civilian died when a suicide bomber targeted a Pakistani army convoy in North Waziristan Monday, news reports said.
The bomber aimed a car with explosives at the army vehicles as they drove near the regional capital Miran Shah, army spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.
Some of the nine injured soldiers were in a critical condition. 
Security forces immediately cordoned off the area.
A woman in a passing car was also killed in the blast and another person injured, according to Geo television news.
The attack came six days after Pakistani forces killed around 10 people in an airstrike on an alleged Taliban compound in South Waziristan, drawing threats of reprisals by local tribesmen.
But it was too soon to talk of a direct link, the army spokesman said, adding that the attack was probably the work of people who are against the peace treaty in North Waziristan.
The government in Islamabad last September concluded a controversial peace deal with pro-Taliban tribes in the region. 
Amid indications that this did not stem Taliban raids into neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistan is under US pressure to boost operations against militants in the tribal belt along the border.
Other media reports said that a purported spokesman for pro-Taliban forces in North Waziristan, Abdullah Farhad, denied they were behind Monday's attack.
Strikes against the militants carry the risk of retaliation against the Pakistani military.
Last November, 42 army recruits died in a suicide bombing at a camp in Dargai in north-west Pakistan. 
The attack was seen as payback for an airstrike nine days earlier on suspected militants at a madrassa religious school in Bajaur that killed more than 80 people. 
A Dutch court on Monday acquitted a man charged for actively helping an Amsterdam woman commit suicide in June 2004, Dutch news agency ANP reported.
The court ruled that there was sufficient doubt that Ton Vink, 53, who calls himself a suicide consultant, did not supervise the woman's suicide despite being in contact with her over a period of 10 months before her death.
The prosecution had charged that Vink had gone too far in consulting the woman by telling her how much medicine she needed to kill herself.
Vink is connected with the Dutch suicide consultancy De Einder.
In previous cases consultants from De Einder have been sentenced to up to a year in prison.
In December 2005 a court sentenced Jan Hilarius, the founder of De Einder, to a year in jail for helping a mentally ill woman end her life.
At the time the court said the fact that Hilarius was not present when the woman killed herself was not a decisive factor.
In 2003, another consultant was sentenced to six months in prison for helping a woman commit suicide. 
De Einder was set up in 1995 to offer professional help to people who want to kill themselves by either persuading them to change their mind or assisting them to do so if that is their choice, the group's Web site says.
The Netherlands became the first country to legalise euthanasia in 2001 but doctors must obey strict rules.
Patients must face a future of unbearable suffering and make a voluntary, well-considered request to die. 
Doctor and patient must be convinced there is no other solution. 
A second doctor must be consulted and life ended in a medically appropriate way.
The first big snowstorm of the winter brought traffic chaos to Danish roads on Monday, including a 40-car pileup on a highway south of Copenhagen.     
It's pure chaos, and that's no exaggeration. 
It's all because of the snowstorm and there are so many accidents. 
We don't really have a clear picture, Koge Police spokesman Kenneth Hojlund was quoted as saying on the the Web site of the newspaper Politiken. 
The pile-up, which was the largest single incident, occurred near Koge, about 35 km (22 miles) south of Copenhagen. 
Around 200 cars had to be pulled from the snow, the newspaper Berlingske said, and 700 motorists had asked for help in starting their vehicles. 
No serious injuries were reported. 
An Islamist website on Sunday posted a video of an attack on a US Apache helicopter in the Taji region north of the Iraqi capital that was claimed by the Iraqi branch of Al-Qaeda.
The US military revealed earlier that four US helicopters which crashed in the past two weeks, killing a total of 20 troops and private security guards, had been shot down by insurgents.
On the video which runs for more than three minutes, two helicopters are seen flying low over a wooded area while militants on the ground handle explosives, then one of the aircraft is hit.
The video shows the Apache catching fire and crashing near a hillside.
The images are accompanied by verses from the Koran, religious chants and calls for jihad, or holy war, in the name of Sheikh Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the head of a Sunni group linked to Al-Qaeda.
An Internet statement posted on Friday in the name of the Al-Qaeda front organization boasted: "The soldiers of the Islamic emirate have found new methods to take on your aircraft." 
It promised to post a video as proof.
A British archbishop warned on Monday of the threat of Britain becoming a police state in the wake of anti-terror raids last week which triggered Muslim protests.
The Ugandan-born Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, said government efforts to introduce laws allowing the detention of terror suspects for up to 90 days were like his native country under 1970s tyrant Idi Amin.
If you detain people, you must have good enough reason for detaining them and have a chance for there being a successful prosecution, he told ITV news, after anti-terror raids detained nine people in Birmingham last week.
Under current laws the nine, Pakistani-origin Britons, can be held for up to 28 days without charge -- despite efforts by the government to extend it to 90 days.
(The Home Secretary) has not produced the evidence that shows that in 90 days you're capable of getting somebody prosecuted, said Sentamu.
Why does he want these days, so the police do what? Gather more evidence?
To me that becomes, if you're not very careful, very close to a police state in which they pick you up and then they say later on we'll find evidence against you.
 That's what happened in Uganda with Idi Amin, he added.
Semtamu, who fled Uganda in the 1970s, is now the second highest cleric in the Church of England, after the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams.
South Korea and Hong Kong said on Tuesday they had joined a growing list of economies banning British poultry due to the country's first outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu in domestic poultry.
Russia and Japan have already banned imports and the Financial Times reported that South Africa and Indonesia had followed suit.
South Korea imported about $3 million in poultry products from Britain last year. 
It will either cull or return 3,645 ducks imported for breeding that it had in quarantine in the country, the agriculture ministry said.
South Korea's major poultry import from Britain has been live ducks for breeding.
We're not sure yet if the United Kingdom may face more bird flu outbreaks, said an official at the agriculture ministry.
Hong Kong, which imported 11,400 tonnes of British poultry and poultry products in the first 10 months of last year, announced late Monday it would suspend the imports with immediate effect, an official said.
Britain culled almost 160,000 turkeys on Monday after discovery of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu on a farm in eastern England run by Europe's largest turkey producer, Bernard Matthews.
Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, Feb 17 (ANTARA/DPA) - Spanish police were Friday questioning a 32-year-old Mauritanian who hijacked a Boeing 737 en route from Mauritania to Las Palmas on Spain's Canary Islands, police said.
Armed with two pistols, the hijacker demanded that the pilot divert the Air Mauritanie plane to Paris, where he reportedly intended to request political asylum on Thursday.
The pilot answered that he did not have enough fuel to fly to Paris and landed in Las Palmas while some of the 71 passengers on board overpowered the hijacker.
Police said the man's motives were not clear.
Some of the passengers sustained slight injuries, many of them on jumping down from the plane in Las Palmas. 
The 14 who were hospitalized were released from hospital on Friday.
The plane flew back to Nouadhibou in Mauritania. 
It had initially taken off from Nouakchott, the capital of the north-west African country, and made a stopover in Nouadhibou.
One of Britain's most glamorous couples, actor  Hugh Grant and socialite Jemima Khan, have decided to go their separate ways, the US website.
Hugh and Jemima have decided to split amicably, Grant's publicist Robert Garlock said on the website.
The news came the same day that Grant's ex-girlfriend, British model and actress Elizabeth Hurley, and Indian businessman Arun Nayar told officials of their plan to wed.
Grant's long relationship with Hurley ended in 2000.
For the last three years Grant, 46, has been dating the 33-year-old Khan, the ex-wife of cricketer Imran Khan and daughter of the late Euroskeptic tycoon Sir James Goldsmith.
Grant, famous for playing fancy-free cads in films like Four Weddings and a Funeral or Bridget Jones, appeared content with Khan when he spoke at a press conference in London last month for his latest movie.
It's true that I have taken a long time to settle down, Grant said. 
My life is very nice now.
His latest movie, Music and Lyrics, is a romantic comedy about an over-the-hill rock star who eventually finds love in mid-life.
Zimbabwean police on Sunday confirmed the arrest of an undisclosed number of opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party supporters gathered for a rally in the capital Harare.
State radio reported on running battles between police and the MDC at Machipisa shopping centre in the low income suburb of Highfield near Zimbabwe Grounds, the venue for the rally.
A spokesman for the MDC earlier said riot police had used water cannons and teargas and beat up party supporters wanting to attend the rally that had been due to be addressed by MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai.
Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena confirmed police had refused to sanction the rally for political reasons, according to the report.
The rally was not sanctioned for political reasons, a decision reached on the basis of previous acts of violence perpetrated by opposition party supporters, Bvudzijena was quoted as saying.
Bvudzijena also told the radio station that police were still compiling information on people arrested and property destroyed. 
He also noted that police were maintaining a heavy presence in Highfield, a hotbed of opposition support.
MDC officials told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa on Sunday that dozens of the party supporters had been taken in by police.
People were thoroughly beaten. 
It (the venue) was turned into a battlefield, MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said in a telephone interview.
The police action came in defiance of a High Court order obtained by the party on Saturday, ruling that the rally could go ahead.
Earlier, police said they did not have the manpower to maintain crowd control, and prohibited the rally.
Police were saying they didn't have manpower, said Chamisa. 
Clearly there is enough manpower for the dictatorship, but not enough for democracy.
Tsvangirai, a former trade unionist, had been expected to launch a campaign for next year's presidential elections.
Political tension is on the rise in Zimbabwe, amid a worsening economic crisis and a controversial bid by the southern African country's longtime president, Robert Mugabe, to delay presidential polls by two years.
Chamisa said Sunday's showdown with the government had strengthened his party's resolve to bring about a political transformation in Zimbabwe, which is marked by spiralling poverty and the highest inflation rate in the world at more than 1,500 per cent.
What we need to do is liberate the country, as of yesterday, he said.
Mugabe's government is on edge as it faces a possible strike by 180,000 civil servants next week. 
The civil servants, many of them teachers, last week rejected a government offer of a 260 per cent pay increase.
State media on Sunday claimed the government workers had resolved to go on strike, despite ongoing salary negotiations, and were now working in league with the opposition to promote civil disobedience.
Four major hospitals in the capital and the second city of Bulawayo have already been crippled by a junior doctors strike that began late last year.
Militants killed two Iranian policemen and kidnapped four others in a late-night ambush in a sensitive border province before fleeing towards Pakistan, officials said on Wednesday.
The clash in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan follows an upsurge of violence in the area which the authorities blame on plots by archfoe the United States and Pakistan's inability to control its border.
Seven police fell victim to an ambush by rebels who killed two police and took four hostage late on Tuesday, the state news agency IRNA quoted police chief Esmael Ahmadi-Mogadam as saying.
The rebels who were in two cars fled towards Pakistan, he added. 
He did not give details about the fate of the seventh policeman.
He complained about the lack of cooperation from Pakistan to fight against these rebels adding that this position is unacceptable.
However, a border official in Pakistan said he had no knowledge of any such incident and dismissed Iranian complaints that its frontier security was lax.
We intercept any illegal movement and the two sides have signed several agreements for strict border control and counter-narcotics cooperation, said Captain Shahid, a spokesman for the Pakistan frontier security force in Quetta.
Sistan-Baluchestan, home to a population of minority Baluch Sunni Muslims, borders Pakistan to the south and Afghanistan to the north.
Thirteen Revolutionary Guards were killed earlier this month when militants set off a car bomb in the provincial capital Zahedan and security forces also clashed with militants in the city when a percussion bomb exploded.
The unrest in Sistan-Baluchestan has coincided with renewed clashes between Iranian forces and Kurdish rebels in the northwestern province of West Azarbaijan close to the border with Turkey.
Revolutionary Guards head General Yahya Rahim Safavi said more than 30 rebels had been killed in clashes in the northwest over the last few days and that Iranian forces still had other militants encircled.
An Australian man who worked as a baggage handler for the national airline Qantas was jailed for at least two years on Friday for stealing hair from women's luggage to satisfy a sexual fetish.
Rodney Lyle Petersen, 30, pleaded guilty in the Victorian County Court to 50 counts of theft, Australian Associated Press reported.
The court was told that Petersen would rummage through lost or delayed luggage that he was returning to passengers. 
He collected the hair from brushes and clothing, then put it inside plastic slips and record the women's personal details.
Police said he had catalogued the hair in more than 80 bags.
Petersen's lawyer told the court that his client did not mean to frighten the women because they were not meant to find out.
The court was told that Petersen suffered from a range of sexual deviances.
He was sentenced to two years and eight months in jail, with a non-parole period of two years.
Physically active young adults are less likely than their more sedentary peers to develop high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, a new study confirms.
Exercise has been demonstrated to reduce older adults' likelihood of developing high blood pressure, but there is little information on how physical activity affects hypertension risk in younger adults, blacks, and women, Emily D. Parker of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and colleagues note in the American Journal of Public Health.
To investigate, Parker and her team analyzed data on 3,993 black and white 18- to 30-year-old men and women who were followed for 15 years. 
The men were the most active, followed by white women and black women.
Study participants' risk of developing hypertension during follow-up dropped by 11 percent for every additional 300-exercise-unit increase in activity, equivalent to about five weekly exercise sessions burning 300 calories each.
The most physically active individuals were 17 percent less likely to develop hypertension than the least active ones, and the effect was the same for both men and women and blacks and whites.
Based on their results, Parker and her colleagues say physical activity merits attention in the prevention of incident hypertension among young adults, particularly as they move into middle age.
Western governments including the US and Britain are trying to topple President Robert Mugabe by funding the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, the Zimbabwe government said Wednesday.
Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said there was clear evidence Harare's long-time foes were working with the MDC whose leader Morgan Tsvangirai is currently in intensive care after being arrested in a government crackdown.
Government has noticed with utter dismay the unconditional statement of support to the violent MDC by a number of Western governments, including those of Britain, America and New Zealand, Ndlovu said in a statement.
It also notes the role of big Western media networks led by the BBC and CNN in seeking to absolve the MDC from obvious and inescapable blame for public violence. 
This is in addition to the massive funding the opposition recently got from the same governments to underwrite the present campaign.
All this reinforces already available evidence of support and funding of the MDC by these foreign governments to realise those governments' avowed goal of bringing about regime change in Zimbabwe as punishment for our daring to reclaim our land, he added.
Mugabe, the target of Western sanctions after allegations of vote-rigging and an often violent seizures of farms from their white owners, has regularly accused the MDC of being agents of former colonial power Britain.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who has heavily criticised the arrests and subsequent beating of Tsvangirai and dozens of his supporters, has previously described Zimbabwe as an outpost of tyranny.
One man was killed and three were injured when two military training helicopters collided in mid-air on Wednesday, the Ministry of Defence said.
The aircraft crashed over the Royal Air Force's Ternhill airbase near Market Drayton, Shropshire.
One of the casualties is seriously injured. 
No more details of the collision or those hurt were released.
The helicopters, each carrying two people, were single-engine trainers called Squirrels, used to instruct pilots in the RAF, army and navy.
One was based at the RAF's Central Flying School and the other at No. 660 Squadron, located at the Defence Helicopter Flying school at RAF Shawbury in Shropshire.
Australia's controversial Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone was stripped of her post Tuesday in a frontbench reshuffle by Prime Minister John Howard.
The department will be renamed the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, dropping a previous reference to multicultural affairs.
The whole purpose of immigration is to recruit more people to the broader Australian family, Howard told a news conference.
Vanstone will be replaced by Kevin Andrews, who has been moved from his position as Workplace Relations Minister.
That post, crucial to promoting the government's labour reforms ahead of an election later this year, will be taken by human services minister Joe Hockey.
Former merchant banker Malcolm Turnbull has joined the cabinet as Environment Minister, a portfolio taking in the problem of water resources in the driest inhabited continent on earth, which is facing its worst drought in a century.
He replaces Ian Campbell, who has been demoted to the human services portfolio a non-cabinet post.
Howard refused to give reasons for sacking Vanstone, but the immigration department has been involved in a series of embarrassing bungles, including the deportation and detention of Australian citizens.
There is as yet no confirmation of the deaths of targeted Al-Qaeda suspects who may have been killed in recent fighting in Somalia, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said in an interview published in the Financial Times on Monday.
Meles told the business daily that though bloodied papers had been found belonging to Aden Hashi Ayro, a militant suspected by the United States of protecting leaders of an east African Al-Qaeda cell that bombed US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, reported sightings of him suggest he is alive.
The prime minister also said that Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Hassan Turki, two leaders of the Islamic Courts Union a hard-line Islamist party that implemented Sharia law in the parts of Somalia it controlled were alive and moving in and out of Kenya on the border.
We do not have definite information on a number of the key Al-Qaeda targets. 
There are reports that one or two of them might have died but we have no confirmation, Meles was quoted as saying by the FT.
Ethiopia intervened in Somalia in December in a US-backed offensive, followed by successive US air strikes against suspected Al-Qaeda operatives there.
The Committee to Protect Journalists painted a bleak image of press freedom in its annual report Monday, accusing governments and guerrillas alike of controlling, intimidating and censoring the media.
From tightening controls on the press in Russia to Internet restrictions in China, the New York-based watchdog said governments were increasingly shifting from overt repression to more subtle ways to muzzle their critics in the media.
The Attacks on the Press report said that while journalists were protected by international law, in an era in which even US officials describe the Geneva Conventions as 'quaint,' these protections increasingly exist in name only.
Events in Iraq and Lebanon reflect the erosion in war correspondents' traditional status as neutral observers, the group's executive director Joel Simon said in the introduction to the more than 300-page report.
In Iraq, the most dangerous conflict in CPJ's history, insurgents so routinely target reporters that more than two-thirds of media deaths are murders, not acts of war, he added.
The report said that while there was no evidence to suggest that the 14 journalists killed by US forces in Iraq were deliberately targeted, none of the killings had been adequately investigated by the military.
Journalists traditionally rely more on savvy than international law to stay alive in war zones, often promising insurgent and guerrilla groups an opportunity to get their message out to the world.
It said that many insurgents, however, preferred to use the Internet to disseminate their message. Among these groups, journalists are dispensable.
The state of affairs is deeply disturbing because it means that the public knows little about vital issues, it added.
The report identified Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as among the worst offenders.
Presidents Chavez and Putin represent a generation of sophisticated, elected leaders who have created a legal framework to control, intimidate, and censor the news media, the report said.
The rise of 'democratators' -- popularly elected autocrats -- is alarming because it represents a new model for government control, it said, accusing the leaders of tolerating the facade of democracy while gutting it from within.
Other nations take a revolving-door approach, imprisoning journalists and releasing them before an international outcry.
It said Iran, for example, had banned more than 100 publications and jailed dozens of journalists since 2000, and while many were released after relatively short periods, the official threat of re-arrest hung over them.
Certainly, there are countries that still rely on brute force; Cuba and Eritrea, where dozens of journalists are imprisoned, are among them. 
But overt repression, more and more, has given way to other techniques.
It accused governments of calculated indifference in many journalists' killings, contending that in 85 percent of cases in which journalists were murdered in the last 15 years, no one was ever brought to justice.
This unsolved violence provokes massive self-censorship, it said.
The watchdog said 13 journalists had been murdered in Russia since Putin took power in 2000 and that none of the killers had been brought to justice.
This record causes reporters to ask fewer questions, to probe less deeply, to pass up risky stories, it said. Putin, while professing concern, benefits from this state of fear.
China, meanwhile, was depriving its citizens of basic information, it said, by erecting massive firewalls and enlisting corporate cooperation to control the medium.
The flood of information that circulates in the Internet age can blind us to the fact that enemies of press freedom still succeed in keeping vital stories from the public eye, Simon said in summary.
We are saturated with information but often deprived of essential news.
UN chief Ban Ki-Moon on Monday called for bold steps by Israel and the Palestinians to jumpstart the ailing Middle East peace process.
Without bold steps to guarantee security of the Palestinian and Israeli civilian populations, and without tangible measures that will enable the Palestinians to lead a normal economic and social life, the political process will not succeed, he said.
He made the remarks in a message delivered by his assistant secretary general for political affairs, Angela Kane, to a UN seminar on aid to the Palestinians in Doha, Qatar.
Ban urged Israel to lift all restrictions on moving goods and people in the occupied Palestinian territory and on Palestinians to take firm measures to cease rocket fire and other indiscriminate attacks against Israeli civilians as necessary steps to revive the peace process.
The UN secretary general also warned that Israeli restrictions, ongoing settlement activities and construction of a controversial West Bank barrier continued to have a devastating impact on the precarious economy of the occupied Palestinian territory and to create a serious humanitarian emergency.
These steps also complicate efforts to achieve a two-state solution to the conflict, he added.
Israel justifies its massive barrier of electric fencing, barbed wire and concrete walls by insisting it is vital to stop potential attackers from infiltrating the country and settlements in the West Bank.
The Palestinians have condemned the barrier, which carves a 650 kilometre (400-mile) route through the West Bank, as a bid to grab their land and undermine the viability of a promised future state.
The International Court of Justice issued a non-binding ruling in July 2004 that parts of the barrier were illegal and should be torn down.
Meanwhile the UN secretary general stressed that internal Palestinian tensions are further compounding an already dismal situation, in a reference to the clashes between the rival Palestinian Fatah and Hamas organizations in Gaza.
But he also hailed renewed efforts by the Middle East Quartet -- the  UN, the United States, Russia and the European Union -- to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and the resumption of direct talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
The Quartet agreed at a meeting in Washington Friday to endorse an initiative by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to speed up efforts towards the creation of a Palestinian state.
It also agreed to extend a debilitating, year-old aid embargo on the Hamas-led Palestinian government until the Islamist movement recognizes Israel's right to exist, renounces violence and honors past peace agreements.
It is vital to build on these steps with a credible political process that is supported by the world community, Ban said. 
We must all focus on resolving the conflict, and on improving the socio-economic situation, not merely managing its inevitable crises.
And he told reporters here that he fully backed a trilateral meeting later this month between US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the Palestinian Authority and Israeli leaders. 
The two-day Doha meeting, sponsored by the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, is to assess the socio-economic and humanitarian crises in the occupied Palestinian territory, review international and regional responses to the needs of the Palestinians and explore ways to ensure a Palestinian economic recovery.
The Pentagon announced Friday that it is accelerating the deployment of a division headquarters to Iraq by about three months, adding another 1,000 troops to a surge in forces.
The 3rd Infantry Division headquarters based in Fort Stewart, Georgia will deploy next month instead of in June, a Pentagon statement said.
The headquarters will provide command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities in support of Baghdad security operations, it said.
Earlier, the commander of a multinational division in Baghdad said the military was looking at a second division headquarters for the Baghdad area because of the swelling size of the US force in the capital.
About 35,000 US troops are now assigned to the city, including eight combat brigades, said Major General Joseph Fil, adding that he expects to get more brigades.
Fil, who spoke to reporters here via video conference from Baghdad, said his headquarters does not now have a problem controlling that size force.
But we are looking hard at bringing in another division headquarters that might take regions perhaps to the outside of Baghdad in order to allow us to further concentrate our efforts inside the city, he said.
With additional brigades, Fil said he also will need more combat support and combat services troops.
I haven't put a number on it. 
We have requested specific elements -- in other words, additional attack helicopters and additional engineers, he said.
The 3rd Infantry Division division already has 4,500 troops in Iraq, and another 8,000 are preparing to deploy in March and May, the US Army said. 
The headquarters move will involve about 1,000 soldiers.
President George W. Bush has ordered the deployment of some 21,500 additional combat troops to Iraq as part of a major push to halt a slide toward civil war and secure Baghdad.
The Pentagon has not said how many support troops it will send but disputes an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office that the surge could grow to between 35,000 and 48,000 additional troops when support forces are taken into account.
There are currently 141,000 US troops in Iraq.
A double car bombing ripped through a crowded Baghdad market Sunday, killing at least 60 people and wounding more than 130 in a first vicious blow to the city's new US-led security operation.
Where is the security plan? wailed distraught relatives crowded outside the Iraqi capital's Kindi Hospital, as fleets of ambulances and civilian trucks ferried the dead and dying into an overworked emergency room.
Kindi received 42 corpses including 10 children aged between five and 10 and was treating 83 seriously wounded patients, medics said.
Ibn Nafees Hospital saw 14 dead and 20 critically injured men, women and children, a medic there said. 
The doctors warned that these figures would rise and a security official put the latest toll at 60 dead.
A first explosion ripped through a crowded vegetable market in Baghdad Jadida, a mixed but mainly Shiite district of east Baghdad.
At almost the same moment, another booby-trapped car detonated a few hundred metres (yards) away near a row of electrical goods shops.
Desperate bystanders scoured the blackened debris for wounded loved ones, while shell-shocked bystanders loaded the injured into civilian vehicles.
In a separate attack in nearby Sadr City, a suicide car bomber attacked a checkpoint manned by Iraqi police commandos, killed one policeman and one civilian bystander and wounded 11 more, a security official said.
Earlier, an unidentified sniper shot dead three civilians shopping in the Fadhel district of the city, according to a defence official.
Separately, the US military announced its first casualties since the launch of the plan two soldiers killed in north Baghdad on Saturday, one by an insurgent's grenade, the other by small arms fire.
Car bomb attacks in east Baghdad are the hallmark of Sunni extremists targeting Shiite civilians in the Iraqi capital's vicious sectarian war.
Last Monday, at least 79 people were killed in similar attacks on Shiite markets, but the violence had tailed off since the launch of a large-scale security operation by US and Iraqi forces on Wednesday.
Shortly before the blasts, the commander of Iraqi forces involved in the operation, General Abboud Gambar, had toured parts of Baghdad Jadida with reporters to demonstrate the progress made by his forces.
I want to tell the people, from this place, that security is coming to Baghdad, Gambar told reporters. 
We will chase the terrorists out of Baghdad.
Some 50 people drowned in the murky waters of Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta after the boat they were travelling on capsized, local media reported Friday.
The wooden passenger and cargo boat hit turbulent weather shortly after leaving the jetty at the Bayelsa state capital Yenagoa on Thursday but allegedly went under because it was overloaded with people and freight.
The boat may have sunk under its own weight as it was overloaded with cargo by the operator. It was said to have developed a mechanical problem which made it easy for the waves to overcome it during turbulence, Nigerian newspaper This Day reported.
Passengers had fled to the lower deck because of the heavy downpour, getting trapped on that level when the boat capsized on the Nun River.
Most of the passengers were women and children, local media said.
Dozens of people were killed last month when a vessel heading from neighbouring Cameroon to Nigeria capsized, apparently carrying too much cargo.
Colombia denied Sunday that its army commander collaborated with outlaw, private paramilitary squads, as a US newspaper reported based on CIA documents.
The government of Colombia rejects accusations that foreign intelligence agencies have made against General Mario Montoya through leaks to the press without any prior evidence having been presented to Colombia's justice system or government, said a statement released from the presidential palace.
Montoya was previously commander of the 4th army brigade before President Alvaro Uribe named him to command the army.
Uribe has been dogged by accusations that he has ties to the right-wing paramilitary armies, dating back to his days as governor of Antioquia province.
More recently, accusations of ties to the paramilitaries forced the resignation of Uribe's foreign minister, after her brother and several other senators of Uribe's governing coalition were arrested on suspicion of collaborating with the paramilitaries.
Uribe's choice to head Colombia's secret police was also implicated.
Colombia is the closest US ally in the region, and the United States has lavished 4.8 billion dollars on Plan Colombia, to fight drug trafficking and leftist rebels.
The Colombian government asks foreign intelligence agencies to present any evidentiary accusation against members of Colombia's institutions to the judicial authorities, the statement said.
The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that the US Central Intelligence Agency has information showing Montoya collaborated with the paramilitaries Washington considers terrorist groups.
The CIA report says Montoya and a paramilitary group jointly conducted a military operation in 2002 to eliminate Marxist guerrillas from poor areas around Medellin, Colombia's industrial city, according to the Times account.
At least 14 people died during the operation, and Uribe opponents allege that dozens more disappeared in its aftermath, the report said.
In the CIA document, an informant reported that the army, police and paramilitaries had signed documents spelling out their plans for the operation, Times said.
The signatories, according to the informant, were Montoya, the local police commander and paramilitary leader Fabio Jaramillo, a subordinate of Diego Fernando Murillo Bejarano, the head of Medellin paramilitaries.
Murillo took control of Medellin's drug trade after Pablo Escobar died, the report said. 
He is now in a Colombian prison, and the Unites States wants his extradition.
Montoya has served as an instructor at the US-sponsored military training center formerly called the School of the Americas, the paper said.
An American civilian and two other foreigners were wounded on Monday when the US embassy in Baghdad came under indirect fire, a US military spokesman said.
There was an indirect fire attack that impacted near the embassy and one US civilian and two third country nationals were wounded. 
They're being treated, Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver told AFP.
They were hurt while in the vicinity of the embassy at the time of the attack, Garver said. 
He could not confirm whether the American or the other two people were embassy employees.
A second bout of indirect fire near the embassy took place later but caused no casualties. 
A US official told AFP there was no significant damage to the embassy building.
At approximately 4:20 pm Baghdad local time there was an explosion in the international zone. 
Preliminary reports indicate it was a rocket. 
There are no casualties reported. 
Damage was minimal, he said.
The attack came just hours after outgoing US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad gave a farewell news conference following a 21-month posting to Baghdad.
Climate experts were trying to agree on Friday on the bleakest U.N. warning yet about the impacts of global warming, foreseeing hunger and water shortages in Africa and Asia, extinctions of species and rising oceans.
Delegates from more than 100 nations in the U.N. climate panel were locked in overnight talks in Brussels, seeking to overcome differences about a 21-page summary for policymakers to allow planned publication at 08:00 GMT.
The talks, which began on Monday, are to review and approve a report warning that climate change could lead to lower crop yields in Africa, a thaw of Himalayan glaciers and a rise in ocean levels that could last for centuries.
It will say climate change, blamed mainly on human emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, is no longer a vague, distant threat for the planet.
The whole of climate change is something actually here and now rather than something for the future, Neil Adger, a British lead author of the report, said in a break from the late-night talks.
He said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would make a much stronger statement about the regional impacts of climate change than in its previous report in 2001.
U.N. officials, who had hoped for the talks to be completed on Thursday, predicted that they might end around 2 a.m. (00:00 GMT) on Friday.
Negotiators slightly watered down threats of extinctions.
Approximately 20-30 percent of plant and animal species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed 1.5-2.5 degrees Celsius (2.7-4.5 Fahrenheit), an agreed text said.
The draft had said that 20-30 percent of all species would be at high risk of extinction with those temperature rises.
There are very, very many (outstanding issues), and many of them are small, said Wolfgang Cramer, a delegate from Germany.
The report, which is approved by governments as well as scientists, will set the tone for policy making in coming years,
including the effort to extend the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012.
Kyoto binds 35 rich nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions but has been undercut by a 2001 pullout by the United States, the top emitter. 
President George W. Bush says Kyoto would cost U.S. jobs and wrongly excludes developing nations such as China.
Friday's report will be the second by the IPCC this year.
In February, the first said it was more than 90 percent probable that mankind was to blame for most global warming since 1950.
Friday's report makes clear that developing nations are likely to suffer most even though they have done little to burn fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution.
South Korea and China plan to set up military hotlines to handle unforeseen situations in the Yellow Sea as part of efforts to strengthen their security ties, officials said Friday.
The deal will be finalised at talks next week between South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, military officials said. 
Wen is scheduled to visit Seoul on April 10-11.
South Korean Defence Minister Yoon Kwang-Ung offered to set up military hotlines at talks with his Chinese counterpart Cao Gangchuan in Seoul last April. 
Yoon also proposed holding joint naval rescue operations.
The issue of setting up hotlines has been discussed at working-level meetings following talks between the defence chiefs of the two countries, a defence ministry official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
A final deal should be made at talks between Roh and Wen, he said.
Chinese troops fought for North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War. 
But Seoul and Beijing have stepped up economic and diplomatic cooperation since they normalised ties in 1992.
Military officials said the hotlines would help China and South Korea exchange information on the infiltration of any unidentified aircraft or ships onto the Korean peninsula.
The hotlines will also help the two countries reduce tensions in the Yellow Sea, where dozens of Chinese vessels engage in illegal fishing every day, they said.
Unidentified attackers petrol-bombed a Yemeni mosque Friday, wounding 30 worshippers, eight of them seriously, the official Saba news agency reported.
The attackers struck during the main weekly Muslim prayers at the mosque in Amran province, north of the capital, the news agency said.
Thirty people suffered burns, eight of them serious ones, after unknown individuals entered the mosque... and then proceeded to spray the worshippers with petrol and set them alight, Saba quoted a provincial official as saying.
Other members of the congregation suffered from the effects of smoke inhalation, the official added.
There was no immediate word on who might have carried out the attack or whether there was any connection with a deadly three-year-old rebellion among the Zaidi minority in Yemen's northern mountains.
South Korea's health minister on Friday expressed his intention to resign over the parliament's rejection of a bill meant to reform the national pension fund law, the Yonhap News Agency reported.
Citing sources at the presidential office, the report said Health and Welfare Minister Rhyu Si Min conveyed his intention to President Roh Moo Hyun during a dinner meeting.
Rhyu, an aide of the president, has offered him a strong support since the time of the 2002 presidential election. 
Roh is likely to accept Ryu's resignation, the report said.
Rhyu, well-known for his outspoken manner, was inaugurated by Roh in February 2006 without parliamentary approval after a hearing was embroiled over his remarks.
The bill, turned down by the assembly on Monday, would have reduced beneficiaries' pension payments from the current 60 percent to 50 percent of the beneficiary's total income. 
It would have also raised subscribers' payments because the fund is expected to be depleted in four decades, according to Yonhap.
US Democrats will not seek to cut funding for US troops in Iraq but will insist on political progress in the war-torn country as a condition, a key senator said Sunday.
We're not going to cut off funding for the troops, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin, told ABC news, commenting on the Democrats' bid to timetable the forces' withdrawal.
President George W. Bush has vowed to veto any legislation to withdraw the troops next year, raising the question of how they would proceed with their drive to wind up the bloody war.
What we should do, and we're going to do, is continue to press this president to put some pressure on the Iraqi leaders to reach a political settlement, Levin said.
Lawmakers passed Democrat-sponsored proposals that would make crucial funding for the Iraq war conditional on pulling out the troops. 
Bush dismissed the Democrats' efforts to set a date as a political statement.
The House of Representatives and Senate passed bills with different pullout deadlines, August 31, 2008, and March 31, 2008, respectively. 
The two chambers must reconcile the two bills before agreeing on a single text to send to Bush.
On Saturday Bush urged the Democrats to pass their bill to him as soon as possible so he could veto it and Congress could get to work on drafting an alternative to fund the troops.
Levin responded on Sunday by calling on Bush to fulfill his promise to make the Iraqis meet political benchmarks. 
These conditions will still be included in the funding bill even if the withdrawal timetable is scrapped, he said.
The Iraqis have not kept any of the benchmarks that they set for themselves so far: dividing resources, dividing the oil resources, sharing power, Levin said.
The chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, Jon Kyl, denied Iraqis were failing to meet these conditions, however.
The Iraqis are beginning to do the things that we've asked them to do, he told CNN, citing a US military report. 
They are cooperating with us.
That's one of the reasons this new (troop) surge strategy is working.
Congress has gone on Easter recess. 
The Senate is expected to resume its work on April 10, while the House of Representatives returns April 16.
US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates arrived in Cairo Wednesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace process and weapons sales.
I'm going to be interested in President Mubarak's views on the situation in region, said Gates, speaking ahead of departure to Cairo.
The defence secretary, on a Middle East tour that began on Monday in Amman, said he will also discuss with the Egyptian leader events in Iraq, Iran's growing strength in the region and the situation in Lebanon.
His trip to Egypt was delayed by a day due to the fierce sandstorm that closed down the Cairo airport for several hours on Tuesday.
Gates, in the region to rally support for Iraq's government and counter Iran's growing influence, held talks with King Abdullah II in Amman on Tuesday.
Mahendra Chaudhry, who was ousted as Fiji's prime minister in a coup six years ago, was returned to government on Tuesday by the country's military chief who has assumed power after a military takeover last month, according to reports from the capital Suva.
Military Commander Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama, who has had himself sworn in as prime minister, named Chaudhry as Finance Minister with additional responsibilities for national planning, public enterprises and reform of the sugar industry, in his new cabinet.
Although Bainimarama insists it is an interim government, another minister, Jona Senilagakali, who has the health portfolio, told Australia's ABC Radio that he believed it would be at least a year before new elections will be held.
Chaudhry, who was the first ethnic Indian to become prime minister after his Labour Party won an election in 1999, was overthrown the following May by an armed group of indigenous Fijian nationalists led by businessman George Speight.
He and members of his cabinet were held hostage at parliament by Speight and his supporters for more than seven weeks before the military installed indigenous Fijian banker Laisenia Qarase as prime minister.
Bainimarama overthrew Qarase on December  5, claiming his government was corrupt, introduced policies favouring indigenous Fijians over the Indian minority and was planning to pardon Speight, who is serving a life sentence for treason, and his fellow coup plotters.
Chaudhry said his appointment was a strange twist of destiny, because he had been given the same post in 1987 when former military chief and prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka overthrew the first government dominated by ethnic Indians, although it was led by Fijian Timoci Bavadra.
Both New Zealand and Australia have condemned Bainimarama's coup and announced sanctions, including warning that anyone taking a post in his government will be banned from entering their countries.    
He said the interim administration would look for economic support from China if Australia and New Zealand continued to shun the new military-backed regime. 
The widow of Rwanda's former president Juvenal Habyarimana, whose murder sparked the 1994 genocide, has been denied asylum by France on the grounds she may have played a role in the killing spree, a judicial source said Wednesday.
Agathe Habyarimana's July 2004 request for asylum was turned down on January 4 by France's refugee office OFPRA, which said in its ruling that she may have taken part as a instigator or accomplice in the crime of genocide.
Habyarimana, who has lived in France since she was evacuated by French troops after the genocide, will have a chance to appeal the decision before a refugees' commission on January 25.
One of her lawyers, Philippe Meilhac, denounced the decision as baseless, pointing out that no action has been taken against her by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) trying the perpetrators of the genocide.
Habyarimana is a civil plaintiff in a French investigation into the downing of the plane carrying her husband, a Hutu, on April 6, 1994, which touched off the massacre of close to 800,000 people, mainly minority Tutsis.
Rwanda broke diplomatic relations with France last month after the judge in charge of the case called for President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi, to face trial over Habyarimana's death. Kagame has always denied any involvement.
Anti-apartheid campaigner and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Nelson Mandela was named as the most popular political hero in a survey of British MPs published in The Independent on Tuesday.
Mandela was nominated by 27 MPs in a survey of more than 150 members of the lower House of Commons conducted by CommunicateResearch, followed by former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher with 12 nominations and British war-time leader Winston Churchill with 11.
Current British Prime Minister Tony Blair was fourth with seven, and former health secretary Aneurin Bevan, credited as one of the architects of Britain's government-run National Health Service, rounded out the top five.
The MPs were given free rein in the survey to nominate anyone as their hero, leading to a wide variety of submissions.
One member of parliament named Jed Bartlett, the fictional American president played by Martin Sheen in the US television drama The West Wing.
Another listed Theoden, King of Rohan, a character from JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, while one nominated Boudica, queen of a Celtic tribe from eastern Britain who led an uprising against the occupying Roman Empire in the year 61.
Among the more conventional nominations, meanwhile, were former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who had four submissions, and former US president Bill Clinton.
The Lebanese opposition decided late Tuesday to stop its one-day strike and blockade of roads, in which three people have been killed and more than 133 others wounded.
The opposition has decided not to extend their strike until Wednesday, a statement by the opposition said.
A Lebanese security source said, Arab efforts carried behind the scenes led the opposition to halt their originally intended one-day strike, which led to violence and closure of main roads.
Thick clouds of smoke billowed over Beirut and other cities as demonstrators have been blocking roads with burning tyres and old cars since dawn.
Some protestors lay down on the roads to block traffic while many shops, business and schools were forced to shut as main roads had been closed.
The opposition have been staging sit-ins since December 1 in downtown Beirut to topple the Seniora government, which took office after the elections following the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005, with a national unity cabinet in which the governing coalition would have a minority veto.
Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Seniora has called on the Parliament to hold an extraordinary session to discuss Lebanon's ongoing political crisis.
An ultra-leftist group opposed to the conflict in Iraq has claimed responsibility for attacks on a U.S. military base near Tokyo this week, police said on Saturday.
Two projectiles were fired near the U.S. Army's Camp Zama base, about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Tokyo, late on Monday.
There were no injuries and no damage.
The Kakumeigun, or Revolutionary Army, group claimed responsibility for the incident, a police spokesman said.
The attacks were aimed at disrupting the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan as well as the planned three-day visit to Japan by U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney from Tuesday, the group said in a statement, according to the police spokesman.
Police said they believed the small and little-known group belonged to the Revolutionary Workers' Council (Kakuryokyo), which was blamed for a string of high-profile projectile and arson attacks in the 1990s.
Such groups have targeted U.S. military installations in Japan in the past and the Iraq conflict has prompted police to step up security at such facilities.
The United States has 50,000 troops stationed in Japan under the U.S.-Japan security alliance. 
Residents have complained in the past about crime, noise and pollution associated with the bases.
But the public generally supports the alliance.
Japan sent about 550 non-combat troops to southern Iraq.
That mission ended last July, but about 200 air force personnel remain in Kuwait to transport supplies to the U.S.-led coalition.
US Democrats Sunday vowed to find new ways to pressure President George W. Bush over his handling of the Iraq war, after failing to break a Senate deadlock to hold a debate on his unpopular strategy.
Democrats regrouped from Saturday's legislative setback by floating new strategies to challenge the president's plan to introduce a surge of some 21,500 US combat forces into Iraq.
Top among the options under consideration by Democratic lawmakers is a proposed measure that would revoke the October 2002 authorization that allowed Bush to invade Iraq.
US Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Sunday that a vote on revoking Bush's war authority --which he finds preferable to cutting funds to US troops outright -- was probably the best approach.
The Iraq war resolution approved by the Senate more than four years ago, he said was a wide open authorization which allowed him (Bush) to do just about anything and put us now deep into combat in Iraq, and now into the neighborhoods of Baghdad.
I think we'll be looking at a modification of that authorization in order to limit the mission of American troops to a support mission instead of a combat mission, and that is very different from cutting off funds, said Levin.
He vowed, however, that one way or another Democrats would pull out the stops to pass legislation taking the president to task for his handling of Iraq, even if they did not succeed in getting a vote on a symbolic censure measure Saturday.
It may be more difficult than to get a binding resolution passed, but we're going to continue to try, because we are determined that we're going to change course in Iraq, he told Fox television, 
He calling the administration's plan to send 21,500 fresh troops to Iraq a mistake.
It's just going to plunge us in deeper into a civil war. 
This is not a surge. 
This is a plunge which we're talking about into the unknown and into maybe the unknowable, the Democrat said.
Levin added that a new war authorization would allow Congress to set new boundaries for US forces in Iraq and end this unlimited mission.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Joseph Biden agreed on the need to repeal and restate the president's authority, make it clear that the purpose that he has troops in there is to, in fact, protect against Al-Qaeda gaining chunks of territory, training the Iraqi forces.
 It's not to get in the midst of a civil war.
Without advocating any specific proposal for forcing the administration to alter its course in Iraq, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said various options were being explored.
Any proposal, I think, offered by any member of Congress, I think we should look at very seriously. 
It involves the worst foreign policy mistake in the history of this country, he told CNN television.
A non-binding resolution criticizing Bush's war plan had better luck in the House of Representatives, passing Friday by a 246-182 vote along mainly party lines.
Belarus police have crushed the first legal demonstration in years by several thousand opponents of President Aleksander Lukashenko in Minsk, reports said Sunday.
According to the witnesses, special security forces forcibly removed protestors from October Square in the centre of Minsk.
However, it had not been permitted to deviate from a route approved by the authorities.
Ten days after his Fatah party joined the Islamic Hamas movement in a unity government, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asked US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Monday to pressure Israel to revive peace talks, a senior aide said.
President Abbas told Rice that confining talks between the Palestinian and Israeli sides to humanitarian and security issues is insufficient, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters as Rice, on a diplomatic blitz through the Middle East, held talks with Abbas in Amman for the second time in as many days.
Rice also held a two-hour meeting Monday night with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the second of her current visit.    
She had been slated to hold a news conference Monday evening,
Summarizing her visit and announcing a strategy of indirect, parallel shuttle negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians under US mediation. 
But the encounter was postponed until Tuesday morning amid reports of Israeli objections to the US shuttle diplomacy approach.
Israel says it will not revive peace negotiations so long as the Hamas-Fatah government, like the Hamas-only cabinet that it replaced, refused to recognize the Jewish state's right to exist. 
Instead, it is willing to hold bilateral talks with Abbas, the Fatah leader, but only on improving Palestinian living conditions and enhancing security cooperation.
Authority is required in order to create the correct equation for encouraging a fruitful negotiating process, Olmert told his cabinet Sunday. 
Referring to the new government's platform and its failure to free an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza by Hamas.
Earlier Monday, Rice had said she had no intention of taking over Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
I don't intend by any means to take control of the Israeli Palestinian bilateral dialogue, she said after meeting Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, following her return to Jerusalem from Amman.
In Ramallah Sunday, Rice stressed, I think that it is extremely important that there be a political horizon for Israelis and Palestinians. 
But she indirectly admitted the time was not ripe for direct negotiations, saying, I think this time it is best to talk about that political horizon in parallel.
Her visit to the region, the central feature of enhanced diplomacy since the Fatah-Hamas government was sworn in Saturday last week, coincided with that of United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who said after meeting Olmert in Jerusalem Monday that President Abbas is ready for peace.
While insisting the new government must meet international criteria of non-violence and recognition of Israel, Ban said it should be given some political space to do so.
The visits to the region by Rice and Ban come ahead of a crucial Arab League summit in Riyadh this week, at which participants are expected to relaunch a 2002 peace proposal which promises recognition of Israel by Arab states in return for a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
Jordan's King Abdullah II on Monday urged Israel to accept the Arab peace initiative and leave the territories it occupied in the 1967 war, if it wants to live in peace with Arab countries.
In an interview with Dubai-based al-Arabiyah satellite television, the monarch also cited a unified Palestinian attitude based on honouring all accords concluded with Israel as a prerequisite for lasting Middle East peace.
We should send a message to Israel that it bears a big responsibility toward peace in this region, Abdullah said.
If it has a sincere desire to live in peace it should seek such peace, accept the Arab peace initiative, end the occupation, recognize the principle of the two states and apply this on the ground in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions and agreements concluded with the Palestinians, he added.
The Arab peace initiative, which was first endorsed by the Arab summit conference in Beirut in 2002, envisages the recognition of the Jewish state by all Arab countries if Israel quits all Arab land it occupied in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
The Arab summit, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in Riyadh, is expected to re-launch the blueprint by presenting it anew to the world's influential capitals.
The monarch went on to say what is required from the Palestinians is a unified stance based on commitment to all accords they have reached with the Israeli side.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is due to end a landmark tour of the region within a few hours, denied she was seeking an amendment of the document at the behest of Israel, but urged Arab leaders to come up with a mechanism for reinvigorating their peace initiative.
Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir was set to meet UN chief Ban Ki-moon in Riyadh on Tuesday to discuss the Darfur conflict as Khartoum continues to defy demands to allow UN peacekeepers into the war-torn region.
Beshir has consistently rejected UN plans to deploy a peacekeeping force in Darfur and refused to turn over war crimes suspects to the International Criminal Court.
An Arab League official said on Monday the Riyadh talks would also be attended by Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, Arab League chief Amr Mussa and the head of the African Union's executive arm, Alpha Oumar Konare.
According to the United Nations, at least 200,00O people have died and more than two million been displaced since the conflict between rebels and government forces erupted in Darfur in February 2003. 
Some sources say the death toll is much higher.
Tuesday's talks come on the eve of the annual Arab summit in the Saudi capital which Ban is also due to attend.
On Monday Beshir again refused to have Ahmed Haroun, the current secretary of state for humanitarian affairs who is suspected by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of Darfur war crimes, questioned or sacked.
Haroun will not resign or be fired and will not be interrogated, Beshir told the independent daily Al-Sudani in a new tirade against the tribunal.
Sudanese Foreign Minister Lam Akol echoed Beshir's comments in Riyadh on Monday, saying the ICC had no right to put any Sudanese citizen on trial.
Beshir's remarks came after last week's announcement by Sudan's general prosecutor that Haroun would be questioned over crimes in the troubled western Sudanese region, despite having been earlier cleared of any wrongdoing by the country's judiciary.
In February, ICC prosecutor Luis-Moreno Ocampo accused Haroun and a local militia leader of 51 crimes against humanity and war crimes -- including murder, torture and mass rape.
Rwanda's first post-genocide president walked out of prison on Friday, freed after a presidential pardon for a 15-year sentence he received on charges that included inciting ethnic violence.
Pasteur Bizimungu was jailed in 2004 after a trial critics said was politically motivated. 
He had been convicted for creating a militia, embezzling state funds and inciting ethnic violence in a nation still healing from genocide.
An ethnic Hutu, he became president when the ruling Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) took power after the genocide in which extremists from the Hutu majority butchered 800,000 Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
President Paul Kagame, whose Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Army ended the hundred days of slaughter, was then vice-president and overshadowed Bizimungu because he had more power in reality than his superior.
Cooperation between Bizimungu, a French-speaking Hutu, and Kagame, an English-speaking Tutsi, was intended to symbolise post-genocide reconciliation. 
But their relationship soured, and in March 2000, Bizimungu resigned after falling out with senior RPF members over the make-up of a new cabinet.
Bizimungu in 2006 lost a court appeal to have his conviction overturned, claiming it was politically motivated. 
He subsequently sent Kagame a letter, pleading for mercy and a release he said would be for the good of the nation.
A Sunni insurgent group has claimed responsibility for a deadly roadside bomb attack on a British patrol this week in southern Iraq, according to a message posted Saturday on a militant website.
The Mujahedeen Army, or Jaish al-Mujahedeen, said it was responsible for planting the explosives that killed four British servicemen and their Kuwaiti interpreter on April 5, said the US-based SITE Institute, which monitors Islamist sites.
The group set up an ambush in the early morning hours against the British patrol, planting an improvised explosive device near the southern city of Basra which detonated as a British armored vehicle approached the area, it said.
The explosion led to its complete destruction and the death of those who were in it, and was followed by an exchange of fire which led to the injury of several British soldiers, it said.
The British military said earlier this week that the four soldiers and civilian translator travelling in the same vehicle were killed outside Basra in a complex roadside bomb, small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenade attack.
Jaish al-Mujahedeen first emerged in February 2005 when it claimed the abduction of two Indonesian journalists, who were freed after nearly a week in captivity.
It has since taken credit for several attacks in Iraq, including shooting down a US Blackhawk helicopter in February.
Four Pakistani paramilitary soldiers were injured Sunday when bombs exploded near their vehicles in northwest Pakistan, officials said.
A remote-controlled bomb exploded on a roadside near a paramilitary contingent outside the tribal town of Tank, local police official Abdullah said.
The blast injured two paramilitary soldiers and damaged their vehicle, he said.
In a second incident a remote-controlled roadside bomb near the town of Bannu exploded when paramilitary soldiers were patrolling the area, a security official said. 
Two soldiers were injured.
Bannu and Tank border the restive Waziristan tribal district where 250 people, mostly Uzbek and Chechan fighters, have been killed in the past three weeks.
In Parachinar, another Pakistani tribal area, fierce sectarian clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims since Friday have left 40 people dead.         
Authorities have deployed troops and imposed a curfew in Parachinar to try to control the violence.
Pakistan has deployed some 80,000 troops in its tribal areas bordering Afghanistan to check the movement of Taliban and Al-Qaeda linked militants who launch attacks on foreign troops in Afghanistan.
The Iranian authorities are trying to discover what has happened to a U.S. citizen who Washington said it believed went missing several weeks ago while on private business in Iran, an Iranian official said on Sunday.
The United States sent an official inquiry about the missing former FBI agent, Robert Levinson, to Iran earlier this month via Swiss diplomats, who act as go-betweens with Tehran because the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
The relevant organisations are following the case to find clear news about his fate, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a weekly news conference.
Hossein Zolfaqari, deputy head of the Islamic Republic Law Enforcement Forces, said on Saturday he had no information about the disappearance of the American citizen, according to the official IRNA news agency, monitored by the BBC.
The missing man, described by officials as middle-aged, is believed to have been visiting Kish, an Iranian resort island and free trade zone in the Gulf.
He is not believed to be of Iranian descent and his wife lives in the United States
A local official in Kish Island in south of Iran said last week that no firm evidence on the American citizen's entrance to the island have been obtained, the IRNA report said.
The United States has been looking into the case for weeks, trying to establish whether Levinson may have been picked up by the Iranians or someone linked to the Russian mafia. 
So far it has no definite leads.
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei told the leader of Japan's New Komeito party Tuesday that China's foreign minister will visit Japan in the middle of next month, New Komeito lawmaker Yosuke Takagi told reporters in Beijing.
Wu told New Komeito leader Akihiro Ota that Li Zhaoxing will make the trip to lay the groundwork for a later visit to Japan by one of China's top leaders, Takagi added.
The latter trip is expected to be made by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, possibly in the spring.
On Monday, Chinese President Hu Jintao told Ota that he plans to visit Japan this year, at a time convenient for both sides.
But it is widely believed Wen will make a Japan trip before the Chinese president.
Taiwan on Tuesday expressed concern over rival China's military buildup, saying its recent space test and further deployment of missiles along the coastal area have posed a serious threat to peace and security in the region.
China carried out an anti-satellite weapons test on Jan. 11, in which an old Chinese weather satellite was destroyed by a ballistic missile.
The move raises widespread attention from such countries as the United States, Japan and Australia, which contend that doing so may cause an arms race in space.
Taiwan's military echoed such worries, noting that it is obvious that China has been striving for dominance in space so as to boost its position as a superpower and to increase its clout in negotiations with other major powers.
Taiwan possess no military satellites and for the moment will not be directly affected in terms of the collection and analysis of intelligence, said Maj.
But we are watching very closely the following development.
China sees Taiwan as part of its territory despite nearly 60 years of separate rule and threatens military actions should the island declare formal independence.
On Monday, the United Daily News, a Chinese-language newspaper in Taiwan, quoted unidentified U.S. sources as saying Taiwan's missile defense would not be effective given China's diverse missile programs.
The report also said China's deployment of missies aimed at Taiwan is still increasing and shows no sign of ending soon.
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice paid an unannounced visit to Baghdad on Saturday, arriving as American and Iraqi troops made initial gains in a new crackdown against militants in the Iraqi capital.
A U.S. embassy official said Rice was expected to meet various officials during her visit.
The top U.S. diplomat is scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Jerusalem on Monday.
She arrived in Baghdad a day after the U.S. House of Representatives denounced President George W. Bush's decision to send more troops to help with the Baghdad offensive. 
The move was a symbolic challenge to Bush's unpopular war.
In Baghdad, U.S. and Iraqi forces sweeping through the city have encountered little resistance to an operation seen as a final effort to quell sectarian violence that threatens to tear Iraq apart.
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, under heavy U.S. pressure to show progress, told Bush on Friday that the effort had been a brilliant success so far. 
Bush said U.S. patience was not unlimited.     
Violence has declined in Baghdad as thousands of U.S. and Iraqi forces flow into the city, but the dip is likely temporary while insurgents assess the situation, said Major General Joseph Fil, commander of U.S. troops in Baghdad.
An explosion caused by a suspected bomb in a McDonald's restaurant in Russia's second city of St Petersburg on Sunday injured at least five people, officials said.
A police spokesman told Reuters there had been an explosion in the restaurant on Nevsky Prospect, the city's main thoroughfare, and that five people had been wounded.
Police said their initial information was that the blast was caused by an explosive device, but the spokesman said they had yet to identify what sort of device it was.
Russia's Interfax news agency quoted emergency services as saying six people were hurt with concussion, burns and shrapnel wounds.
Anti-Moscow rebels linked to Russia's Chechnya region have mounted a spate of bomb attacks on civilians in Russia but there has been no major attack outside the turbulent North Caucasus region for more than two years.
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy began pulling ahead of its rivals Monday as counting continued after weekend general elections in southern Africa's mountain kingdom, organisers said.
Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili's party had won 18 of the first 31 constituencies to declare while former foreign minister Tom Thabane's All Basotho Convention (ABC) was trailing in second place with 12 seats, independent electoral commission spokesman Rethabile Pholo told AFP.
An alliance of minor parties had secured one seat after Saturday's elections, Pholo added.
A total of 80 MPs will be directly elected in constituencies while another 40 will be elected via proportional representation.
Observers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) gave the vote a generally clean bill of health on Sunday but the spectre of another contested election loomed as Thabane outlined a list of grievances.
The former foreign minister, who quit the cabinet and formed the ABC late last year, claimed some of his supporters had found their names absent from the electoral register and alleged there had been some multiple voting.
When his camp tried to file complaints with the independent electoral commission, their representatives were nowhere to be found, he said.
Disputed elections in 1998, when Mosisili was first elevated to power, resulted in mass protests which were only quelled when the South African and Botswanan armies intervened in the small mountain kingdom.
The African Union on Wednesday officially created a peacekeeping force of more than 1,500 South African troops for Burundi to help integrate the country's last active rebel movement.
The pan-African body has taken over from the United Nations to facilitate the integration of the Forces of National Liberation (FNL) into a broader peace process.
This unit will have some 1,500 South African soldiers and a mandate of six months, Mamadou Bah, AU representative in Burundi, told journalists.
We have to do everything so that the integration of the FNL ends within this delay.
Bah signed an accord with Burundi foreign minister Antoinette Batumubwira for the creation of the AU force in line with a September 7 ceasefire, which has yet to be fully implemented even if fighting has stopped.
In December, South Africa's 768 UN peacekeeping troops in Burundi were transferred under the authority of the African Union.
South Africa last week agreed to deploy a further 1,100 troops as part of the AU special task force in Burundi.
The civil conflict in the small nation pitted the army, dominated until recently by the Tutsi minority, against various Hutu rebel movements.
The African Union is disturbed by attacks on its peacekeepers in Somalia and member states are consulting about the situation, AU Chairman John Kufuor said on Wednesday.
It's unfortunate that the first batch of troops to have gone there has been met with shooting, Kufuor told a news conference in London.
It is discouraging and the African Union is rather disturbed, said Kufuor, who is also president of Ghana.
More than 1,000 Ugandan troops landed in the Somali capital Mogadishu last week, the vanguard of an 8,000 strong African Union force designed to help the fragile Somali government restore order to the anarchic country.
However the Ugandans have been attacked since landing and two were wounded in an ambush the day after they arrived.
Analysts say the AU troops are targets because they are seen as supporting a government that has many enemies in Mogadishu.
I am hoping that the African Union will not give up in trying to assist Somalia find a peaceful way to peace, said Kufuor during a state visit to Britain.
That's what I want to say now. 
Of course consultations are going on among members of the union, and between me as the chair and the secretariat, he said.
The Horn of Africa country slid into anarchy after former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled in 1991, and 13 earlier attempts to create an effective central rule all failed.
Kufuor stressed Ghana had committed troops to the AU force not to meddle in Somalia but to help a sister African nation try to achieve normalcy through peacekeeping.
NATO warplanes called in by the Afghan army bombed and killed 19 militants in southern Afghanistan, taking the toll from a four-day operation to 99, the defence ministry said Monday.
The 19 were killed in the southern province of Helmand on Sunday, it said in a statement.
The Afghan army launched the sweep of the Gereshk area of the province on Thursday, the second day of the Afghan new year.
Operation Nawrozi (New Year) is the first large operation launched by Afghan forces with NATO air support but not ground troops.
An Israeli soldier captured by Palestinian militants nearly ten months ago could be be released soon, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Friday.
I am optimistic he will soon be free, Abbas told France 24 television.
Corporal Gilad Shalit was snatched on June 25 during a cross-border raid that three Palestinian militant organizations launched on an Israeli army outpost near the Gaza Strip.
Despite previous optimistic statements, intensive efforts, with the help of Egyptian mediation, to secure his release have so far come to naught.
Shalit is believed to be held captive in the Gaza Strip.
An Israeli-Arab daily based in Nazareth reported Friday that two weeks ago he received eyeglasses, which were given to Egypt two months ago and transferred via an Egyptian delegation negotiating his release.
A spokesman for the radical Popular Resistance Committees, one of the groups believed holding the soldier, refused to confirm the report which appeared in the a-Sinara daily.
Israeli helicopters fired into the northern Gaza Strip on Saturday in what local residents described as the fiercest exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters since a November truce.
The residents said the helicopters fired at least two missiles at guerrillas near the Jabalya refugee camp.
An Israeli army spokesman said the helicopters opened fired after identifying suspicious movements near the border fence where Palestinian fighters had been operating and trying to plant explosive devices.
On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz authorised the army to carry out limited operations just inside Gaza against guerrillas, despite a ceasefire agreement reached between Israel and the Palestinians in November.
Some hardline groups have carried on firing rockets into Israel from Gaza despite the truce, and Peretz said the Jewish state would not allow the continued strengthening and arming of fighters in the coastal strip.
The Bangladeshi government has put its security forces on high alert as the intelligence services have reported about the Islamics' plan of bombing in functions on the Bengali new year's day on April 14.
The intelligence services alerted the government that members  of suicide squad of the banned Islamic outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), widely blamed for series of bombings and suicide attacks in Bangladesh, are assembling in the capital Dhaka and its adjoining districts to carry out fresh attacks on the Bengali new year's day, local daily The Independent reported Saturday.
Six top leaders of the banned JMB, including its head Shaikh Abdur Rahman and his second-in-command Siddiqul Islam alias Bangla Bhai were hanged on March 31 for killing two judges in southern  Bangladesh through suicide bomb attack in November 2005, the year they blasted around 500 bombs across the country almost simultaneously on Aug. 17, 2005.
JMB has been launching secret campaign to establish Islamic rule in Bangladesh. 
Some 50 people including judicial officers, lawyers and police were killed and hundreds injured during their violent campaign in 2005.
The intelligence services have also beefed up surveillance throughout the country following hanging of the top leaders of JMB.
Some combing operations are being taken to thwart attacks by the hardliners and arrest them.
The security forces have been arresting very often the members of the JMB from different parts of Bangladesh during the last few weeks.
Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Naim Ahmed said that a foolproof security net will be in place in and around the Ramna  Park in the capital Dhaka a day before the new year's day on April 14. 
Thousands of people gather to welcome the Bengali new  year.
In 2001, bomb attacks by unknown men on the new year's day functions at Ramna killed at least 10 persons and injured many.
Children throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have observed Palestinian Children's Day, which aims to highlight the plight of children living under Israeli occupation. 
In press statement released on the occasion of Palestinian Children's Day, on Wednesday, Palestinian Network for Children's Rights (PNCR) said that Palestinian children are exposed to daily violations of their rights in contravention of international law as a result of the continuous occupation and aggression by the Israeli army within the Palestinian territories.
PNCR stated that external pressure by the international community on the Palestinian Authority has increased violations against Palestinian children, WAFA reported.
A cut to international aid to the Palestinian people has directly affected the implementation of economic, cultural and social services, undermining the exercise of children's rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, PNCR said. 
PNCR pointed out that, the Israeli army killed 124 children during ongoing military operations in the Palestinian Territories in 2006.
In 2007, the Israeli army continues to deploy the same violent policy towards Palestinian children with 8 children being killed so far this year. 
That brings the total number of children killed since the beginning of the Second Intifada in September 2000, by the Israeli army and illegal Israeli settlers, to 860, it stated. 
Additionally, 5200 Palestinian children have been arrested by the Israeli army since the Second Intifada and among them, close to 400 are still being held in Israeli prisons and interrogation centers, exposing them to many violations of their rights, according to PNCR.
The violations of Palestinian children's rights in the Palestinian territories go beyond the violation of the right to life and liberty.
Israeli military actions and the withholding of international aid by the international community, have gravely affected their right to education, an adequate standard of living, protection from discrimination and protection from economic exploitation, rights articulated in the International Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
Amidst the aggression of the Israeli army and the withdrawal of support by the international community, there is another danger that is not less important.
In some regions within the Territories, the divisions between Palestinian political parties have recently resulted in a breakdown in the rule of law, in violence and a lack of security for the Palestinian population. 
PNCR appealed to the international community and to State Parties to the CRC to uphold their obligations to protect the rights of all children in the international community without discrimination, and to place pressure on the Israeli government to abide by international law and stop the violations of Palestinian children's rights. 
It concluded by calling on the international community to recognize urgently that the major victims of this policy are Palestinian children and that the policy is in contradiction of the CRC, which in principle obliges State Parties to assist other countries in the implementation of the CRC through international cooperation.
The US military announced the deaths of five more US soldiers in a series of attacks taking its toll for the month alone to 26, the military said Monday.
The five were killed Sunday. 
Three soldiers were killed and one wounded in a roadside bombing during a patrol south of Baghdad.
One soldier was killed and three wounded in indirect fire attack targeting their units also south of Baghdad.
Another soldier died of wounds sustained during combat operations in the restive Diyala province, north of Baghdad. The military did not say when he died.
The latest fatalities brought the US military's losses in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,274, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
Indian security forces on Tuesday launched military operations against the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), a major separatist group in the north-eastern state of Assam which has killed 68 people in the state over the past four days, news reports said.
The Indian Army was raiding ULFA's hideouts and bases in Assam and the neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh state as India's Home Ministry decided to send more than 2,000 additional security personnel to quell further violence.
A total of 68 people, mostly migrant workers and traders from the eastern state of Bihar, were killed in the separatist attacks in five districts in Assam since January 5.
On Monday evening, suspected ULFA militants killed three more migrant workers in Golaghat district and carried out two explosions near an army cantonment in the state capital Guwahati, injuring five people, the NDTV network reported. 
But there were no overnight attacks, a government spokesman said.
Security forces have fanned out across the state with a high security alert already sounded to bring the situation under control, state government spokesman Himanta Biswas Sarma was quoted as saying by the IANS news agency.
Amod Kanth, chief of the Arunachal Pradesh police, told the news agency that an offensive was launched in the state to destroy bases from where the rebels operate.
Meanwhile, India's Defence Minister AK Antony and army chief General JJ Singh were scheduled to tour the insurgency-hit state on Tuesday to assess the security situation.
The ULFA, which has been fighting for a separate Assamese homeland since 1979 and wants all non-Assamese, particularly the Hindi-speaking people to leave the state, has not claimed responsibility for the attacks.
The state has witnessed an upsurge of violence ever since New Delhi called off its truce with the militant group in September 2006, saying ULFA had continued violence and extortion in Assam.
Soon after the ceasefire was called off, the ULFA imposed taxes on the non-Assamese people in the state and warned the migrant workers to leave the state immediately.
The latest killings were the worst massacre of non-Assamese Indians by ULFA rebels since more than 100 people were killed in 2000.
The attacks came days after senior ULFA leaders were killed in separate incidents by counter-insurgency forces in the state over the past week and the arrest of two frontline leaders.
The increased violence by the ULFA also follows the publication of a controversial opinion poll that showed 95 per cent of people in nine of Assam's 27 districts did not support the ULFA's demand for an independent Assam.
More than 20,000 people have been killed in the violent separatist movement in the state since 1979. 
South Korea's President Roh Moo Hyun proposed Tuesday a rewriting of the country's Constitution to introduce a four-year presidency with the possibility of a second term in place of the current single, five-year term.
Five Chinese workers abducted inNigeria last week are safe and Chinese Embassy officials are trying to secure their release, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
Gunmen broke into the rented apartment where the telecom workers were staying and forced them away at gunpoint on Friday in Nigeria's southern oil-producing Niger Delta.
A local official said on Monday that the kidnappers had asked for ransom, a motive behind many abductions in the lawless delta, where poor residents live alongside Africa's biggest oil industry.
Our relevant departments and the embassy there are trying whatever they can to rescue the Chinese nationals, ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told a news conference.
Because the mission is ongoing, I cannot provide further information to you. 
As far as we know, the hostages are safe.
A Chinese team made up of embassy officials and staff from the company that employed the men is helping with the search.
Hostages in the Niger Delta are often kept for a few days in remote settlements before being released unharmed after their employers or local authorities pay the ransom.
Seven people were hospitalized in New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York after a powerful, mysterious smell of natural gas wafted over much of Manhattan and parts of New Jersey on Monday, the Reuters news service reported.
The gas-like smell forced building evacuations and a temporary suspension of commuter train service before dissipating.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the odor was not dangerous and no unusual gas leaks had been found.
It may just be an unpleasant smell, but at this point we do not know any more than that. 
The one thing we are confident about is, it is not dangerous, Bloomberg told a news conference.
The gas-like smell permeated lower Manhattan and was detected as far north as Central Park, across the width of the island, and in New Jersey, according to the report.
A U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesman said there is no indication at this time of a terrorism connection.
A UNICEF worker was shot dead in his car as he drove through Baghdad, the UN children's agency confirmed Tuesday.
Janan Jabero, 52, an engineer, married and the father of two, was killed on Monday evening, said a UNICEF spokesman.
Janan Jabero was a brilliant engineer and had been a key part of UNICEF's school rehabilitation programme in Iraq since 1999. 
His death has cost Iraq's children a staunch advocate and we deeply mourn his loss, said UNICEF Representative for Iraq, Roger Wright.
Jabero was one of 87 Iraqi nationals working for UNICEF in Iraq. 
A police investigation is underway.
Gunmen armed with dynamite invaded an oil services base in Bayelsa state in Nigeria's southern oil-producing Niger Delta on Wednesday and kidnapped nine South Korean workers and one Nigerian.       
The gunmen came in six boats to the riverside base in the outskirts of Bayelsa state capital Yenagoa. 
They blew up part of an office building and the ground was littered with pieces of zinc roofing, electrical fittings and air conditioning units.
The militants entered the facility armed with guns and dynamite before dawn, said Han Yang-ho, a Daewoo employee at the site, speaking to South Korean TV network YTN. 
There was an exchange of gunshots and they broke in with dynamite, Han said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. 
Abductions for ransom are frequent in the Niger Delta.
The security situation is worsening in the delta, which accounts for all oil production from OPEC member Nigeria, the world's eighth-biggest exporter of crude. 
A fifth of Nigerian output capacity is shut down because of militant attacks.
The attack on the base operated by South Korea's Daewoo Engineering and Construction came less than a week after five Chinese telecom workers were kidnapped for ransom in another area of the volatile delta.
Daewoo, which is working on a pipeline project in the area, confirmed that nine of its employees, all South Koreans, had been captured.
The U.S. military helicopter that crashed outside Baghdad, killing all 12 on board, was shot down by a shoulder-fired missile, CNN reported on Monday.
The Black Hawk was most likely brought down on Saturday by hostile fire, according to unidentified U.S. officials cited by CNN. 
The crash was still under investigation but debris recovered on the ground indicate a missile was involved, CNN said.
We have not released anything from here on the cause of the crash ... 
The cause of the crash is still under investigation, said Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle in Baghdad.
Twenty-five U.S. troops were killed on Saturday in one of the deadliest days for the American military in Iraq, according to the latest U.S. tally.
Eight people were killed in violence in Baghdad and the northern Iraqi city of Mosul Tuesday, security and medical sources said.
Five policemen died and three were wounded in firefights with gunmen in southern districts of Mosul, a flashpoint city where Sunni insurgents have established a base, Major Mohammed Ahmed said.
In Baghdad, two people were killed and five wounded when a car bomb blasted the western district of Karrada, sources in the interior ministry and hospital sources said.
Another car bomb in the central Sheikh Omar district killed one person and wounded four, the sources said.
The attacks followed a day of carnage on Monday with at least 100 people killed in attacks on popular markets in Baghdad and Khalis, a town northeast of the capital.
An Arab League envoy is expected in Beirut on Monday to prepare for further mediation efforts by its chief Amr Mussa to resolve Lebanon's political crisis, an Arab diplomatic source said Sunday.
Ambassador Hisham Yussef, one of Mussa's top aides, will be in Lebanon for 48 hours from Monday to meet both government and opposition leaders, the source told AFP.
Yussef will have talks with Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri and representatives of the Shiite Hezbollah movement, which is spearheading an anti-government campaign.
Communications Minister Marwan Hamadeh has said Mussa would resume his mediation on February 8.
In mid-December the Arab League chief began mediating between the Hezbollah-led opposition and Siniora's Western-backed government in a bid to settle the dispute sparked by the resignation of six pro-Syria ministers.
The opposition began a sit-in on December 1 outside offices of the anti-Syrian government in central Beirut.
Deadly clashes late last month between supporters of the two camps resulted in seven deaths and more than 300 people wounded.
Mussa has said he hopes the Lebanon crisis can be resolved before the Arab summit in Saudi Arabia at the end of March.
Six Apache attack helicopters have been delivered to Kuwait by the United States, the first of 16 gunships ordered by the Gulf state in a multi-billion dollar deal, a newspaper reported Monday.
The remaining helicopters will arrive before the end of February, Al-Rai daily said, quoting military sources.
The six Apaches arrived on Saturday at Shuaiba port, south of Kuwait City.
Which is often used by the US military, the paper said.
The 16 AH-64D Apache Longbow advanced attack helicopters are part of a 2.1-billion-dollar deal signed between the US and Kuwait in 2002.
The deal, which includes four spare engines and about 300 Hellfire missiles, also provides for maintenance, supply of necessary spare parts and the training of 48 pilots and instructors as well as 200 Kuwaiti technicians.
A team of US engineers arrived with the Apaches for maintenance purposes along with a number of Kuwaiti pilots who received training in the US, the report said.
The Apaches will also be equipped with electronic protection systems, Longbow radars and anti-armour Hellfire air-to-surface missiles.
Since its liberation by a US-led coalition from seven months of Iraqi occupation in 1991, the oil-rich emirate has spent billions of dollars on arms purchases, mainly from the United States.
Gunmen in southern Nigeria on Tuesday kidnapped a Filipino national working as a subcontractor for oil company Shell and killed at least one policeman who was escorting him, industry sources said.
One Filipino was kidnapped at 9:00 am (0800 GMT) and two MOPOL police were killed on the Owerri-Port Harcourt road, a private security advisor said, adding that the Filipino was a Shell subcontractor.
Another industry source said only one policeman had been killed in the incident. 
MOPOL is an elite unit of the Nigerian police tasked with escorting VIPs among other duties.
The second source said the incident happened around Aba, a town on the Owerri-Port Harcourt road and the capital of Abia State.
The latest kidnapping brings to 30 the number of foreigners currently held hostage in southern Nigeria's oil-producing region. 
Of the other 29 held, 24 are Filipinos who were seized from a cargo vessel, two are Italians and the remaining three are a Briton, a US citizen and a Lebanese national.
The seizing of the 24 Filipinos on January 20 prompted Philippine President Gloria Arroyo to slap a temporary ban on workers travelling to Nigeria for employment.
A suicide bomber killed himself and injured five people at the international airport in Islamabad Tuesday evening, Pakistan's Geo news television reported.
Security staff at the airport car park exchanged fire with the attacker when he approached. 
He then triggered explosives on his person, it said.
Two police and three other people were injured in the incident, which happened after 9:00 p.m.
It follows a suicide attack at a five-star hotel in the Pakistani capital on January 26. 
One bomber and a security officer were killed.
China said Saturday it would strengthen controls on the export of nuclear equipment, days after an international agreement was reached on phasing out North Korea's nuclear programme.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao signed a decree banning the use of Chinese nuclear goods and technology to carry out atomic explosions without prior agreement, state press reported.
Importers of Chinese goods will also be barred from using them for nuclear proliferation, except under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Although the decree does not specifically mention North Korea, it comes hot on the heels of an agreement secured on Tuesday in the Chinese capital in which Pyongyang agreed to close its nuclear facility in Yongbyon and allow the return of IAEA inspectors, expelled in December 2002.
Xinhua said existing Chinese regulations on the control of exports had not been tough enough to prevent nuclear proliferation.
US President George W. Bush urged his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao Thursday to keep enforcing UN-imposed sanctions on North Korea.
The United Nations adopted a resolution following North Korea's October 9 test imposing a raft of sanctions, including a ban on selling goods and technologies that could be used for nuclear programmes to Pyongyang.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard has ruled out increasing combat troop numbers in Iraq but is considering sending more training staff for the Iraqi army, a local television network reported Monday.
As far as combat troops are concerned I think the current level is appropriate and I don't expect Australia to be increasing that,'' Howard told the Nine Network.
Australia has deployed about 1,400 troops in and around Iraq.
King Abdullah II of Jordan on Tuesday warned that the failure of the Arab-Israeli peace process would lead to more violence and extremism in the region, according to an official statement.
He made the remarks during separate meetings with the US Assistant Secretary of State David Welch and a number of US diplomats accredited to Middle East countries currently on a visit to Jordan, the statement from the royal court said.
The failure of the peace process will enhance violence and extremism and lead to the retreat of the forces of moderation in the region, the monarch said.
The commitment to the peace process by President George W Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice represents an important opportunity for ending the conflict that has been raging in the region for several decades, he added.
He referred to his last week visit to the United States where he met with Bush and Rice and delivered a speech before a joint session of the two houses of the US Congress.
Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, recovering from injuries he says were inflicted by police, has been released from custody and is due to appear in court later on Wednesday, his lawyer said.
Tsvangirai, who heads the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Zimbabwe's main opposition party, and other opponents of President Robert Mugabe said they were beaten by police after being arrested on Sunday during an anti-government prayer rally.
They have been released from police custody. 
Thirty-one, including Mr. Tsvangirai, are still in hospital while 19 have gone home, Alec Muchadehama, a Tsvangirai attorney, told Reuters.
Iran is considering charging 15 British sailors with illegally entering its waters, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Sunday.
Mottaki told reporters in New York that he would likely speak to British Foreign Minister Margaret Beckett about the issue later on Sunday.
Iran captured 15 British Navy personnel at the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which marks the southern stretch of Iraq's border with Iran, in the Gulf on Friday.
The charge against them is the illegal entrance into Iranian waters and this issue is being considered legally, Mottaki told reporters in New York.
The Iranian authorities intercepted these sailors and marines in Iranian waters and detained them in Iranian waters and this has happened in the past as well, Mottaki said.
But Britain has said two boatloads of Royal Navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a U.N. approved mission in Iraqi waters when Iranian gunboats encircled and captured them.
Mottaki addressed the U.N. Security Council on Saturday after the 15-member body imposed new financial and arms sanctions against Tehran for refusing to suspend uranium enrichment.
Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi was in the lead with 53.5 percent of the vote in a runoff of the presidential election with 82 percent of the ballots counted, an interior ministry source said Monday.
Ould Abdallahi, supported by a coalition of parties once loyal to ousted long-time dictator Maaouiya Ould Taya, was leading in 11 of 13 regions in the country's first democratic presidential election since independence from France in 1960.
His opponent, longtime opposition politician Ahmed Ould Daddah, had won more than 60 percent of Sunday's vote in the capital Nouakchott and his native Trarza region in the southeast, the source said.
Complete preliminary results were expected later Monday.
After a constitutional referendum in June, local and parliamentary polls in November and senatorial elections in January.
The presidential polls mark the final stage of democratic reforms led by the military junta that ousted Ould Taya in August 2005.
Tamil Tiger rebels flying a light aircraft bombed an air force base next to Sri Lanka's international airport before dawn Monday, killing two airmen and wounding 17, reports from Sri Lanka said.
A light Tiger aircraft flew over the air force base and dropped explosives.
There have been two explosions. 
At the same time our air defenses activated and there is a search operation going on,'' Reuters quoted Air Force spokesman Group Captain Ajantha de Silva as saying.
The Sri Lankan government said the attack was aimed at the military base and caused no damage to the adjacent civilian airport north of capital Colombo, the report said.
The airport was temporarily closed but resumed operating, the Associated Press said, quoting a duty officer at the airport.
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice meets Jordan's King Abdullah and holds further talks with Palestinian and Israeli officials on Monday, the third day of her Middle East trip to try and revive peacemaking.
Rice met separately on Sunday with Palestinians and Israelis to gauge the chances for peace talks but said she was not striving for a big bang breakthrough.
She visited the West Bank city of Ramallah to talk to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas before heading to dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in the first of what may be a series of back-and-forth talks with the two.
Making her fourth visit to the Middle East in four months, Rice is talking to them separately because Olmert has ruled out engaging Abbas on peace since the Fatah leader formed a Palestinian unity government with the Islamist Hamas faction.
Israel and the Quartet of Middle East negotiators -- the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- have demanded the Palestinian government recognise Israel, renounce violence and accept existing peace deals.
The new unity administration has agreed only to respect previous accords and has stopped short of recognising Israel or giving up the right to armed struggle.
Rice will meet Abdullah in the Jordanian capital Amman where she also plans to see Abbas, before returning to Jerusalem to for further talks with Olmert.
Rice has been touring the Middle East trying to persuade Arab governments to breathe new life into a peace plan they ratified in 2002 by adding what she calls active diplomacy seen as code for early contacts with Israelis.
Her best hope is that the Israelis and Palestinians will agree to separate but parallel discussions on a common set of issues that could eventually lead to direct negotiations.
You need to prepare the ground well, you need to spend time with the parties. 
You need to understand what is tolerable (for) each side, Rice said at a news conference with Abbas.
Speaking to U.S. reporters before dining with Olmert, Rice acknowledged her approach was cautious and said the chances for quick, dramatic progress were low.
My approach has been, I admit, careful. It's been step by step. 
I have not been willing to try for the big bang. 
I don't think that that's where we are, she said.
The question here isn't speed. 
The question is trying to really move forward toward the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Analysts doubt Rice can make much progress given Olmert's political weakness one opinion poll this month showed he would win as little as 3 percent of the vote if an election were held immediately and the divisions among the Palestinians.
There were clashes between the factions in Gaza last week in a sign of the power struggle between Hamas and Fatah militants.
A Tamil rebel driving an explosive-laden tractor blew himself up at an army sentry point killing at least four civilians and a soldier close to a military camp in eastern Sri Lanka, military sources said Tuesday.
The rebel triggered the explosion as a soldier opened fire when he failed to stop at the sentry point at  Chenkalady, 250 kilometres east of the capital on Tuesday morning, the military said.
Military spokesman Major Upali Rajapaksa confirmed the incidentand said that the intended target was likely Chenkalady camp, one of the biggest in the eastern province.
The civilians caught in the blast were waiting near the sentry point to be checked when the incident occurred, Major Rajapaksa said.
At least seven more civilians, two policemen and two soldiers are among the injured.
Tuesday's attack comes a day after Tamil rebels used airplanes for the first time in the decades-old conflict to drop bombs on Sri Lanka's main air base, killing three people. 
The government says that no damage was incurred to the fighter jets used to bomb rebel positions. 
The pro-rebel Tamilnet website, however, claims that up to 40 per cent of the air facilities of the air force had been damaged.
The military air base adjoins the country's only international airport, and security has been stepped up, though no damage was caused to the airport itself. 
Flights have been in operation with a few delays. 
On Sunday, government troops recaptured more areas held by the rebels in the eastern Batticaloa district.
Iran on Friday called news conference by the freed British sailors painting a grim picture of their 13 days in captivity a planned show, and stood by its claim that the soldiers were in Iranian waters at the time they were captured.
The propaganda and planned shows can not cover up the violation of Iran's sea borders by the British military personnel, foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad-Ali Hosseini was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.
Speaking for the first time since their release and return to Britain Thursday, six members of the group on Friday described how they were put in solitary confinement in tiny stone cells, constantly interrogated and threatened with long prison terms, during a news conference at a naval base in Chivenor in the south-western county of Devon.
Meanwhile the state television IRIB showed a short footage of the conference and said that: while only six members have been ready for speaking, they were all nervously reading from a written note in their hands.
Immediate transferring the sailors to a military camp, dictating them what to read and what to say along with the organized media  propaganda, can not distort the realities and the facts, Hosseini said.
Referring to the service members' transfer to their base for debriefing.
The seven sailors and eight Royal Marines were seized from a British patrol boat on March 23 in the Shatt al-Arab waterway, triggering a diplomatic stand-off between Tehran and London.
Iran alleges that the marines crossed illegally into the country's territorial waters. Britain insisted that they were in Iraqi waters and demanded the immediate release of its personnel.
The sailors, in their news conference, said they were told by their captors that if they refused to admit they were in Iranian waters when captured they would face seven years in prison. 
Beijing on Saturday slammed as defamatory an official US report into the communist country's human rights record, adding that the United States was in no position to lecture other countries.
The State Department report ignores basic facts, slanders and attacks China's human rights situation, a spokesman for the foreign ministry said.
China repudiated the report, spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement on the ministry's website.
The United States is not in a position to depict itself as a human rights watchdog, it said of the April 5 report.
The United States should seriously reflect on its own human rights problems and put an end to its double or multiple standards on human rights, it added.
Titled Supporting Human Rights and Democracy: The US record 2006, the report, submitted to Congress, took stock of the efforts made by the US to encourage respect for human rights across the world.
The section on China said, The Chinese Government continued to deny citizens basic democratic rights, and law enforcement authorities suppressed those perceived to threaten the legitimacy or authority of the Chinese Communist Party.
Chinese officials continued to enforce measures in an attempt to curb the growth of China's emerging civil society, it added.
It also highlighted cases involving the monitoring, harassment, detention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and lawyers, seeking to exercise their rights under law.
Accusing Syria of being behind the movement, Gemayel said that Damascus is trying to undermine Siniora's government and to block the constitutional process designed to establish an international tribunal on the assassination of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri in February 2005.
This coup d'etat is to block the constitution process to endorse the international tribunal. 
Because Syria is really afraid, because it's the first suspect in the  crimes, Gemayel said, referring to the murders of both Hariri and Gemayel's own son Pierre Gemayel, the industry minister assassinated in Beirut last November 21.
Amin Gemayel also attacked the Lebanese Shiite party Hezbollah, which he branded a state within a state.
They have their own army, their own financial system, with the huge and generous financial support from outside.  
Hezbollah enjoyed the full support of Syria and Iran. 
Gemayel said the country cannot afford to have a new civil war.
We're trying now to find a political solution to this crisis. 
I am, myself, also in touch with the Hezbollah and many other parties, trying to avoid the civil war and to find a political solution to the prevailing crisis.
A British soldier was killed on Monday by a roadside bomb in Basra, taking to 100 the number killed in action in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003, the Ministry of Defence said.
The attack on the routine Warrior patrol took place early on Monday in the Al Ashshar district of the southern Iraqi city. 
There had also been several civilian casualties.
The name of the dead soldier was not being released until next of kin had been informed.
The death brings to 131 the total number of British armed forces personnel who have been killed in Iraq since the invasion.
A female NASA astronaut has been arrested in Florida on suspicion of attacking her love rival in a relationship with another astronaut, US reports said.
Navy Captain Lisa Nowak, 43, was arrested Monday at Orlando airport and charged with battery, attempted kidnapping, attempted vehicle burglary and destruction of evidence.
Police said Nowak had driven some 1,500 kilometres from Houston, Texas to confront a woman identified as Colleen Shipman about her relationship with astronaut and naval commander William Oefelein.
Nowak was said to also be in a relationship with Oefelein. 
She was reportedly armed with a BB gun and pepper spray, and wearing a wig.
Transfusion of blood from a donor around the time of surgery appears to increase the risk of blood clots in women, but not in men, according to a new study.
Blood clots in the veins, a condition called venous thromboembolism or VTE, are a serious problem. With VTE, clots can form in the veins of the legs, impairing blood flow. But a bigger concern is when clots travel from the legs to the lungs, which can be fatal.
Transfusion of donated blood can disrupt the normal balance of clotting factors and alter the inflammatory cascade, the study authors explain.
Thereby increasing the risk of clot formation during periods of systemic inflammation such as surgery.
Dr. Kent R. Nilsson and colleagues from Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine and Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland sought to determine whether there was an association between blood product transfusion and VTE in more than 14,000 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery.
Overall, transfusion was associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of developing a blood clot, the authors report, but further analyses showed than the increased risk was limited to women who received transfusions.
Patients who developed VTE faced a 3.8-fold increased mortality, a 2-fold increase in admission to the ICU, a 61 percent increase in the average time spent in the hospital, and a 72 percent increase in average total hospital charges.
The investigators call for further studies, pointing out that given the attendant morbidity and mortality associated with VTE, it is crucial that patients at high risk are identified so that optimal VTE prophylaxis can be given.
The remains of Saddam Hussein's two sons were exhumated and reburied next to the executed ex-president in a hall in their home village of Awjah in northern Iraq on Tuesday, a relative told AFP.
Uday and Qusay, killed by US troops in Mosul in July 2003, were earlier buried in a cemetry in the village, just outside the city of Tikrit.
But today we dug up their remains and reburied them next to Saddam Hussein in the hall where he was laid to rest, the relative said on condition of anonymity.
Saddam was buried on December 31 after his hanging for crimes against humanity.
The hall where the three are buried used to be a gathering place for condolence meetings under the ousted regime.
Two former Saddam henchmen, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Awad Ahmed al-Bandar, were buried outside the hall in a garden after they followed their former boss to the gallows a few weeks later.
All three were sentenced to death for crimes against humanity in the killing of 148 Shiite civilians from Dujail, north of Baghdad, following an abortive 1982 assassination attempt against the then president.
A Palestinian unity government bringing together rival factions is ready and will be voted on by parliament on Saturday after weeks of wrangling, officials said on Wednesday.
The government is now ready and its composition will be announced on Thursday morning, said Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for president Mahmud Abbas, head of the Fatah faction.
On Saturday the government will likely be presented to the legislative council, he said, referring to the Palestinian parliament.
Ghazi Hamad, spokesman for the rival Hamas movement, said premier-designate Ismail Haniya has already asked parliament to convene on Saturday to vote on the new line-up.
Abbas and Haniya met in Gaza on Wednesday to put the finishing touches to the coalition agreement and hammer out a compromise on the candidate for the powerful interior ministry, which has been a main point of contention.
Several names were presented to the president. 
He will choose one and let Haniya know his choice this evening, Abu Rudeina said.
Sources close to Abbas said he was leaning toward naming Fadel Abu Hein, a university professor largely unknown to the public at large.
Abbas's secular Fatah party and the Islamist Hamas movement agreed at a summit in Mecca in February to form a unity government after months of feuding that has left dozens of Palestinians dead.
The power wrangle has been simmering since Hamas's shock win over long-dominant Fatah in a parliamentary election in January 2006.
Palestinians are hoping that the new coalition cabinet will lead to an end of a US and EU-led boycott to the government, which was introduced after Hamas assumed power and has wreaked havoc on the Palestinian economy.
Under the terms of the power-sharing agreement reached in Saudi Arabia, Hamas will occupy nine cabinet seats plus the premiership and their erstwhile rival Fatah will take six.
Hamas will nominate another three independent ministers and Fatah two. 
The radical Islamist movement will also name an interior minister whose candidature must be approved by Abbas.
An Indian and a Lebanese man kidnapped in volatile southern Nigeria last week amid disputes over oil revenues have been released, a diplomatic source said.
Gunmen seized the construction workers from a building site at Agbarho in Delta State on Friday, police said earlier. 
The circumstances are still not clear but I can confirm that they have been freed, the diplomat told AFP on condition of anonymity.
No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, the latest in a series of such attacks against foreigners mainly involved in the oil industry. 
The men worked for BTP Cetraco, a construction company working on a road in the oil-rich region.
There was no news on the fate of a Dutch man kidnapped Friday from Port Harcourt, Nigeria's oil capital, in the southern Rivers State, despite the deployment of military search parties to look for him.
The most high-profile of the separatist groups operating in the region, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, which has abducted dozens of people in the past, said it was not involved this time.
Along with the Dutch security worker, two Chinese nationals abducted on March 17 in the southeastern state of Anambra also remain missing.
Since the start of this year, about 60 foreigners have been kidnapped in Nigeria, as many as were abducted during the whole of 2006.
Reduced output due to unrest cost Nigeria, Africa's largest oil producer, some 4.4 billion dollars last year, according to officials.
The South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers will hold talks this weekend on the southern Korean resort island of Jeju, foreign ministry officials said Monday.
Foreign Minister Taro Aso will visit for talks with his South Korean counterpart Song Min-Soon, said ministry spokesman Ryoo Joohan, adding details had yet to be fixed.
Song and Aso held their first talks in Tokyo last December.
This week's meeting comes after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stirred anger by saying there was no evidence that Tokyo had coerced Asian women into sex slavery during World War II.
Abe has since tried to cool down the row, saying he sincerely stood by the previous Tokyo government's 1993 apology for wartime sex slavery.
South Korea and Japan are also part of the six-nation nuclear disarmament talks on North Korea. 
Tokyo has usually taken a tougher line on Pyongyang.
Bomb attacks killed five US soldiers in Iraq, the US military said on Monday amid reports that the outgoing US ambassador held talks last year with Sunni rebel groups in a bid to curb the country's raging insurgency.
Four of the Americans were killed in a roadside bombing on Sunday gainst their patrol in the troubled province of Diyala, where the chief US commander has said his troops are battling Al-Qaeda, Sunni, Shiite and even Kurdish renegades.
Two troops were also wounded in the attack, while another soldier died in northwestern Baghdad on the same day in another roadside bombing. 
The biggest single killer of US forces fighting in Iraq.
The latest casualties brought the military's losses to 3,234 in since US-led foreign troops invaded Iraq in March 2003 to oust president Saddam Hussein, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
In Iraq's third city of Mosul, gunmen on Sunday killed Sunni tribal leader Mohammed Jassim al-Guud, a member of the Al-Ubada that is a significant Arab tribe in northern Iraq, said police Major Mohammed Ahmed.
Guud's son and nephew were also wounded after the insurgents sprayed his vehicle with gunshots in central Mosul late Sunday, the policeman added.
A police major was similarly killed in a Mosul drive-by shooting on Monday  while the bodies of two male civilians.
One beheaded and one riddled with bullets were found dumped in a western part of the city, Ahmed said.
Four years after the invasion, the more than 140,000 US forces in Iraq are still bogged down fighting a gruelling and ever changing insurgency waged by armed groups, and are a battling to contain Shiite-Sunni sectarian warfare.
Iraqi and US troops last month launched a marathon security operation, the latest in a series of plans to quell the country, deploying 80,000 forces to Baghdad in a bid to wrest back control of the violence-wracked capital.
Two British tourists were killed and another seriously injured when an elephant charged them during a safari in Zimbabwe, the state-run Herald newspaper reported on Monday.
The incident occurred on Saturday in Hwange National Park on Zimbabwe's western border with Botswana, according to police, who did not identify the tourists or provide other details on the attack.
The injured survivor was rushed to a hospital in Bulawayo.
We are investigating to see if there was an act of negligence on the part of the tour guides, Edmore Veterai, a senior assistant police commissioner in Matabeleland North Province, told the newspaper.
Tour guides in Zimbabwe's national parks typically carry weapons to protect tourists from elephants, hippopotamuses and crocodiles.
An angry bull elephant can charge at up to 40 kilometres per hour.
A suicide bomber exploded a truck full of chlorine near a police station killing at least 27 people in the restive western city of Ramadi on Friday, police said.
At least 27 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in the attack, said an officer, specifying that another 30 were wounded.
He said the bomber was targeting a police station, but blew himself up 200 metres away from it near the residental area of Al-Tamim.
The explosion occurred next to a market and residential buildings, he said.
The truck contained many tonnes of chlorine and TNT which were covered by sacks full of fertilisers, he said.
A nearby residental building was also partially damaged by the explosion.
Earlier police Colonel Tark al-Dualiami told AFP that two of the dead were policemen, adding that at least another two police officers were wounded.
Ramadi, the provincial capital of the Sunni Anbar province, is a stronghold of Sunni insurgents and a prime base of Al-Qaeda operators.
In the past few months, insurgents have been using chlorine bombs to attack security forces and civilians in the province.
Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala Saturday called for building a society free of disease on the occasion of marking the World Health Day.
Koirala, who is also looking after the Health and Population Minister portfolio, said, Today we are embarking on building a new, prosperous and peaceful Nepal. 
No one should forget that healthy citizens alone are the means for that big responsibility.
He said since it is the inherent right of every citizen to become healthy and to get the proper opportunity of medication, the government should include this in the first priority of its action plan and work with commitment for providing accessible and affordable health services to the general public.
Koirala also stressed the need for the government to be always sensitive regarding the health of the people by keeping in mind several factors like nutritious food, clean drinking water, healthy environment, proper housing and timely diagnosis.
It is the responsibility of us all to make the people aware for a healthy way of life and to overcome the challenges in the sector through the collective efforts of all, he said.
The World Health Organization has presented the slogan Invest in health: Build a safer future for this year's World Health Day.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday called on all parties in East Timor to make the country's first presidential  election since independence a free and fair one.
I hope the elections will be free, fair, transparent and credible. 
I hope they will be unmarred by violence and intimidation, and I hope they will lead to results accepted by all, Ban said in a message broadcast on local radio.
The way these elections are conducted will be decisive in setting the tone for how your society develops in the future, the UN secretary general said.
The eyes of the world are upon you. 
I call on all candidates and their supporters to accept the results in a peaceful manner.
Voters go to the polls on Monday to elect the successor to Xanana Gusmao, with Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel peace laureate, considered to be a strong contender. 
The powerful Fretilin party chairman, Fransisco Guterres, and Fernando Lasama De Araujo, who chairs the opposition Democrat Party, are also considered to be viable candidates. 
Gusmao is not seeking re-election.
At least 32 people have already been injured in clashes this week in and around the capital Dili, although most of the two-week presidential campaign was peaceful, the UN said.
Violence has pulsed through the fledgling state since it gained independence in 2002 after a period of UN stewardship, Indonesia previously  occupied the former Portuguese colony for a turbulent 24 years.
Two-hundred people blocked roads in an Argentine province on Friday to protest over the death of a teacher, wounded when police used tear gas to quell a demonstration, a civil defense source said.
The death of the 41-year-old teacher late on Thursday deepened a conflict between teaching staff and the local government in the Patagonian province of Neuquen, where teachers want better pay and conditions.
Many public-sector workers are currently seeking higher salaries in Argentina to keep pace with inflation at nearly 10 percent last year.
They're blocking two bridges that are key access routes to the province, said a source from Neuquen's Civil Defense, who asked not to be named.
We don't know what's going to happen because the issue's not just wages. 
They're calling for the authorities in the province to resign over what happened, the source added.
The teacher who died was hit by a tear gas canister when police used tear gas and rubber bullets to force protesting teachers off a highway on Wednesday.
Teachers across the South American country will go on strike on Monday to protest the police response, which also drew criticism from the central government in Buenos Aires.
If there really was an order to put down (the protest) in this way, the culprits have to pay for it. 
We can't have a teacher dead because of a pay dispute, Education Minister Daniel Filmus told local radio.
Hundreds of new guards and closed-circuit TV cameras will be used to protect rare Asiatic lions threatened by poachers and villagers in their only natural habitat, Indian officials said on Saturday.
The government of the western state of Gujarat, where the Gir wildlife sanctuary is located, set up an Asiatic Lion Protection Cell after 10 lions were found dead during the last six weeks, six of them killed by poachers, they said.
Another 21 lions have died over the last five years after falling into open wells in the park, raising questions about the safety of the wild animals and the conservation system in the sprawling, 1,400 sq km (540 sq mile) sanctuary.
I admit lion protection has not been as water-tight as it should be and we are now going to make fundamental changes to safeguard them, P.N. Roychoudhary, a senior state forestry official, told Reuters.
More than 300 new security guards would be deployed as part of the plan, he said.
Police say poachers kill the lions to extract bones and sell them at high prices in Chinese markets. No arrests have been made so far.
The bones are used for traditional Chinese medicine and the claws are worn by some men as pendants in the belief that will increase their virility.
It is the same network of poachers that has been targeting the Indian tigers, said one state police officer, who did not want to be identified. 
Now they have shifted their focus to Asiatic lions.
According to a government census, the number of lions in Gir, where they are protected and bred in natural conditions, had risen to 359 in 2005 from 327 in 2001.
Asiatic lions different from African lions, with a characteristic skin fold on their bellies and thinner manes on the males once roamed most of Asia.
Wildlife activists say the lions are also under threat from thousands of villagers living in and around the forests and want them to be relocated to save the endangered species.
We will have to make the sanctuary an exclusive lion zone. 
It is their last natural abode and India has to protect it, said conservationist R.M. Patel.
India is also struggling to save its endangered tigers, as people invade their habitat and poachers kill them for body parts that fetch huge sums in the international black market.
Some 40 people have been killed and more than 70 injured in fierce sectarian clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in northern Pakistan, officials said Saturday.
So far we have received reports that 40 people have been killed in clashes in two days of fighting between two religious groups in Parachinar, said Arif Habib, a top official dealing with security in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.
Local officials said more than 70 people were also injured in the fighting.
Parachinar, a tribal town close to the Afghan border in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, has a history of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite communities.
The town was placed under curfew on Friday after fighting erupted between the rival groups and troops were deployed to restore order.
Officials said the soldiers had been given shoot-on-sight orders to curb the violence.
Parachinar administration official Sahibzada Anees said army troops backed up by gunship helicopters were patrolling the streets of the town, which has a population of around 70,000.
Officials said 14 deaths occurred when rockets crashed into a house of a resident early Saturday. 
Among those killed were two women and four children.
Clashes between the two communities over a shrine last year left around 20 people dead.
Anees said trouble erupted after members of the Shiite community staged a demonstration Friday outside their mosque against local Sunnis who allegedly chanted anti-Shiite slogans during a religious rally last week.
Shiites, who account for about 20 per cent of Pakistan's 160 million Sunni-dominated population, are in the majority in Parachinar.
Sectarian violence involving Sunni and Shiite militants has claimed more than 4,000 lives since the late 1980s.
The bloodshed comes while unrelated battles between tribesmen and Al-Qaeda foreign militants have been raging in South Waziristan tribal district, some 180 kilometres northeast of Parachinar.
The Waziristan battles have left more than 250 dead, mostly Uzbek and Chechan fighters in the past three weeks.
Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee sustained minor injuries on Saturday when his car crashed head-on with a truck in eastern India, police said.
Mukherjee (71), the number two figure in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's cabinet, was returning to the eastern city of Kolkata after a meeting in Berhampur town in West Bengal state when the accident happened, they said.
The veteran politician was among three injured in the crash. 
He suffered minor bruises, including to the head, and had been admitted to a local hospital, Subrata Mitra, a senior district police officer, said by phone.
The accident took place after one of the truck's tyres burst and its driver lost control of the vehicle about 120 km north of Kolkata, Mitra said.
Mukherjee, a senior member of India's ruling Congress party, was shifted to the foreign ministry from the defence ministry in October.
The post had been vacant for nearly a year before that because the previous foreign minister had quit after he was named in an independent report on irregularities in the United Nations' oil-for-food programme for Iraq.
Iran said on Sunday it would not discuss its obvious right to master the nuclear fuel cycle but was open to talks that could reassure the West that its atomic plans were not aimed at producing bombs.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini also told a weekly news conference the Islamic Republic's military was totally prepared to defend the country and Iran is totally prepared for any possible military strike.
The United States, which believes Iran is trying to build an atomic bomb, has said it wants a diplomatic solution to end the row over Tehran's nuclear ambitions but has not ruled out military action if that route fails.
Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee was seriously injured when his car and a truck collided in the east of the country, the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported early Sunday.
Mukherjee received stitches to the head but was conscious and in stable condition, West Bengal state Home Secretary P.R. Roy told PTI.
The accident occurred late Saturday as the 71-year-old Mukherjee was headed back to the eastern city of Kolkata with other leaders of the ruling Congress party from Murshidabad.
A truck skidded and hit the minister's car head-on near the village of Nakashipara, the agency reported. 
At least four others were injured in the accident.
Mukherjee was first treated at a local hospital and then transferred to a district hospital in Krishnanagar.
Doctors were determining whether to move him again to Kolkata for further treatment.
Mukherjee is a veteran Congress leader from West Bengal state who has held a host of ministerial posts since the 1970s. 
Appointed defence minister in 2004, he took over foreign affairs in October last year.
He is seen as close to both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi. 
Gandhi's biographer Rasheed Kidwai described Mukherjee as the Mister Indispensable of the Congress party. 
When the government is under attack from within the party, the prime minister and Sonia Gandhi look to him to bail them out, Kidwai told AFP last year.
A German national was found dead in his hotel room in mysterious circumstances here Sunday.
Fritz Walter was an engineer and his body was recovered by the police from his hotel room in a main commercial area of the city after the hotel management them when the German didn't come out of his room for three days.
A post mortem would be held to find out the cause of his death. 
But the condition of his body indicates he died within the last 24 hours, a investigating officer said. 
He said the German had arrived March 28 to Karachi to work on a biscuit factory plant.
Meanwhile, in the North West Frontier Province police found the body of a South African national in a plastic bag in the provincial capital city of Peshawar Sunday.
Police officer Behroze Khan said the man was identified as Kenneth Scott Andrew of Durban. 
The passport documents recovered from him shows him as a 26-year-old. 
China's ruling Communist Party has fired a local official for having too many children both with his wife and a mistress in violation of strict family planning policies, a state newspaper said on Monday.
Qin Huaiwen, who headed a construction bureau in Yulin in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, had three daughters with his wife and a son and a daughter by his mistress, who was almost 20 years his junior, the Beijing News said.
Most urban Chinese couples are only allowed to have one child.
One of his daughters by his wife was registered as being his wife's sister's, while the two children he had with his mistress took their mother's surname and lived with their grandparents, the report said.
The family ties only came to light after the mistress began complaining about a lack of child support and her second-rate position to Qin's wife, the newspaper added.
Qin denied his mistress' children were related to him, but DNA tests proved otherwise, it said.
Qin was also charged with adultery, and was expelled from the party as well as losing his job, it said.
Keith Ellison, the Muslim member of the US Congress, who accompanied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a recent Middle East tour, said he hoped to return to Saudi Arabia later this year to perform the Haj.
I did think of going to perform Umrah (the smaller pilgrimage) but the schedule did not allow it, Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, told AFP before the congressional delegation wraps up its regional tour.
I hope to do the Haj this year, God willing, he said. 
Ellison was elected to the House of Representatives when Democrats swept to victory in last November's elections. He arrived in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday as part of Pelosi's seven-member delegation which earlier visited Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon and Syria.  
I had never been to a Muslim country before this visit to the area, said Ellison, who took the oath of office in January on a copy of the Qur'an that belonged to the third US President Thomas Jefferson. 
The Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam which all able-bodied Muslims must undertake once in a lifetime if they have the means. This year, it will fall in December. Ellison, an African American who converted from Roman Catholicism while a student in college, said he believed the United States 'could do much more' in terms of engaging to seek solutions in the Middle East. 
If you want to make peace, you have to talk about the problems preventing peace, he said.
A 3-year-old New Zealand boy died choking on a lolly at his birthday party, it was reported on Monday.
The boy's parents were unable to dislodge the sweet after it stuck in his throat as he celebrated the birthday at his home in Napier on Saturday.
They dialled the emergency number but paramedics could not revive the boy, police said. 
At least two people have been killed in renewed clashes in Mogadishu between Ethiopian troops and Somali insurgents, residents said on Wednesday.
Heavy shelling rocked the southern region of the Somali capital on Tuesday night, and some mortars fell close to the presidential palace.
Two people have been killed and four wounded, a local reporter told Reuters.
The United States launched a fresh air strike Tuesday in southern Somalia, near the site where a US gunship raided suspected Al-Qaeda hideouts the night before, a government official said.
The attack, by at least two helicopters, was aimed at destroying the command and control facility of the terrorists, a Somali defence ministry official told AFP.
Somali troops and Ethiopian forces will go to the area, added the official who declined to be identified.
Ali Said Yusuf Mohamed, a resident of Afmadow, a town about 420 kilometres (263 miles) southwest of Mogadishu, said two helicopters flew over and dropped some bombs on a nearby village.
We do not know whether they were American or Ethiopian helicopters, he said.
The Somali official confirmed that they were US military helicopters.
There were no reports of casualities from the attacked village, which lies in an area where joint Ethiopian and Somali troops have been searching for the remnants of Islamist forces routed in a major offensive that began late last month.
A US AC-130 gunship hit at least two villages in the same area late Monday in a raid targetting suspected Al-Qaeda operatives wanted in connection with the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
Ethiopian and Somali troops last week routed the Islamists from their final stronghold in the southern port town of Kismayo, forcing them to flee into scrublands along the border with Kenya.
Somali officials said the US air strikes were launched after negotiations with the Ayr subclan believed to be sheltering the Al-Qaeda operatives failed to disclose the whereabouts of the wanted men.
The Islamists have vowed to wage a guerrilla war against the government and its Ethiopian backers.
Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said Wednesday that a US air strike on suspected Al-Qaeda targets in southern Somalia had killed eight persons and resulted in the capture of five.
However, speaking to reporters here, Meles said he could not confirm the identities of the dead and wounded and added that seven of 20 fighters targetted in the air strike seemed to have got away.
The target was 20 terrorists, 13 of them are now out of action, he said. 
The remaining we don't know where they are. 
Eight are dead and there are five wounded terrorists now under the control of our troops.
Ethiopia, which sent troops into Somalia last month to back the transitional government and rout the country's rising Islamist movement, has worked closely with US intelligence in tracking Al-Qaeda suspects in southern Somalia.
Meles said Ethiopian forces had gone to the scene of Monday's US raid and collected the dead and wounded, whom he maintained included no civilians, but that none of them had yet been positively identified.
We cannot confirm the identities, they have not been confirmed by proper DNA tests, he said. 
Adding that the bodies would be taken to labs for analysis.
The Ethiopian leader also urged Washington to limit the scope of operations in Somalia, a lawless African nation that has lacked an effective government since the 1991 ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.
Our message to the United States is not to expand the scope of their action in Somalia. 
Let our troops on the ground deal with the situation, he said.
I know for sure that this US strike did not hit civilian targets, Meles said. 
Adding that Monday's target was almost exclusively Somalian but may have involved very senior Islamist court leaders.
The United States carried out its first overt military action in Somalia since 1994 with a targetted air strike on Monday against suspected Al-Qaeda hideouts using an AC-130 gunship.
Somali elders said at least 19 people had died in the attack.
Meles spoke amid reports of fresh strikes near the Kenyan border came amid criticism of US military action in Somalia.
Washington says target Al-Qaeda operatives being sheltered by the country's defeated Islamist movement.
There has been only one American air strike as far as I know ... They knew where the target was and suspected it would be moving and they thought they had to act quickly, Meles said.
The operation so far didn't put us in an uncomfortable situation, but they may in the future if they hit the wrong target. 
So I would very much hope that they will be very selective in their activities and make sure their is no civilian casualties in the exercise, Meles explained.
The Pentagon denied US involvement in at least two later helicopter strikes in the region reported by the Somali defense ministry on Tuesday.
A police officer was shot dead in Russia's Caucasus republic of Dagestan on Saturday night before an apparent follow-up explosion killed two of his colleagues who had come to investigate, a Russian news agency reported Sunday. 
Eight suspected rebels were reported killed in other clashes in Russia's troubled north Caucasus region on Saturday evening, bringing the day's death toll from the unrest to 11.
In the Dagestani capital Makhachkala a police investigator was shot dead with an automatic weapon as he returned home Saturday evening, the Interfax news agency reported, citing a local police official. 
The republic's interior minister then drove to the scene of the crime, and as he approached, an explosion hit a jeep carrying his security guards, killing two, the news agency said. 
Earlier in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia, police fought a two-hour gun battle with rebels, killing four, news agencies reported.
In Chechnya, four rebels were killed when security forces sealed off territory around an old food-processing plant where fighters had holed up, Interfax cited Chechen Interior Minister Ruslan Alkhanov as saying.
Armed clashes are frequent in the Caucasus mountain region in southern Russia. 
Dagestan and Ingushetia both border Chechnya, which has been devastated by more than a decade of conflict between Russian forces and Chechen rebels.
An international conference to combat the use of child soldiers opened in Paris Monday, attended by representatives of some 60 countries, international organisations and aid agencies.
Organised by the French foreign ministry and the UN children's agency UNICEF, the two day conference is to study ways of stopping the recruitment of under-age soldiers, of whom there are estimated to be some 250,000 in the world. 
Participating countries will sign up to a programme promising action to end recruitment, liberate those in arms and help their reinsertion into civil society.
In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy described the use of child-soldiers as a revolting reality, more than a war crime, a time-bomb that threatens growth and stability in Africa and elsewhere.
Former child soldiers and charity workers with experience of the phenomenon were to present testimony to delegates.
Iraq will re-open its borders with Iran and Syria, closed earlier this week in the initial stages of a security crackdown, a spokesman for the officer overseeing the plan said on Saturday.
Seventy-two hours have passed and the borders will gradually re-open, but it will take 60 days for the border crossings to return to normal, Brigadier Qassim Moussawi said, without specifying exactly when they would be reopened.
Moussawi said the borders would be open for a limited number of hours each day, under close scrutiny. 
They were closed on Wednesday.
He said the closure was mainly to allow for the smooth deployment of additional security forces in Baghdad, where U.S. and Iraqi troops have stepped up an operation to try to stabilise the violent capital.
The U.S. military had said the border checkpoints would be revamped, partly to establish transfer points to search vehicles coming in.
U.S. officials accuse Syria of allowing foreign fighters to cross its long, porous border with Iraq, and last weekend presented evidence of what they said was Iranian- manufactured weapons being smuggled into Iraq.
The Slovakian government on Wednesday gave the green light to transfer a unit of military engineers from Kabul to the southern Afghan capital of Kandahar, under NATO command.
We agree with the transfer to Kandahar in light of the work done on clearing mines and reconstruction, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico told a press conference. 
Fico emphasised however that the unit of so-called pioneers would only work within the confines of the city's only air base and that the number of Slovakian troops in of Afghanistan would be limited to 65.
The 57-strong Slovakian unit, currently stationed at Kabul airport, could be operational in Kandahar by June, the prime minister said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called last October for the pioneer unit to be transferred to the south.
That request was initially refused by Fico, who underlined that the contingent was not a combat unit and worried that their safety could not be guaranteed. 
He changed his mind after visiting the area at the end of January.
The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force currently counts some 32,000 soldiers from 37 countries, while the military base in Kandahar alone houses 2,500 troops and 1,000 civilians.
A train collided with a trailer truck Thursday morning on a crossing in Bihoro, Hokkaido, leaving 48 people injured and leading to the arrest of the truck driver for alleged negligence resulting in injuries, local police said.
The police arrested the truck's driver, Hideyuki Kanayama, 45, and quoted him as saying, I slammed on the brakes after realizing the crossing gate was closed, but couldn't stop.
The collision occurred at a railroad crossing between Bihoro and Hiushinai on Hokkaido Railway Co.'s Sekihoku Line at around 8:20 a.m., the company said.
The Hokkaido police said 46 of the train's 70 passengers were injured, as well as the drivers of the train and the truck.
Local firefighters said about 40 people were taken to hospital, including two passengers who suffered serious injuries such as broken bones.
Some of the train passengers were students on their way to a graduation ceremony at a high school in the nearby city of Kitami, and 25 of them were injured and taken to hospital, including a girl who suffered a broken bone, the school said.
A resident living near the accident site said he heard a loud crash and saw ambulances taking bleeding people.
The train is normally empty with only two or three passengers. 
I can't believe that such a lot of people got injured, the 75-year-old resident said.
A four-year old girl has tested positive for bird flu in the Egyptian Nile Delta province of Dakahlia, a health ministry source said Thursday adding that this was the first case detected in Dakahlia.
The girl was reportedly in contact with domestic poultry, the source added.
She is currently being treated at a Cairo hospital. 
Her siblings are being tested for potential infection.
Meanwhile, a two-year old boy from Qena, in central Egypt, also suspected of carrying the virus has been hospitalized.
Since the first outbreak of bird flu in Egypt in 2005, 13 of 23 people who contracted the illness have died.
After an initial panic which saw many Egyptians getting rid of their birds, people in rural areas have since resumed raising poultry domestically to sell at public markets or as a source of cheaper protein.
A few weeks ago, the Egyptian government suspected that a mutated strain of the virus with reduced susceptibility to the Tamiflu vaccine had emerged.
Medical experts confirmed shortly afterwards that the virus had not mutated to a new more dangerous strain transmitted between humans.
Armed clashes broke out Thursday between Iraqi police and gunmen in Iskandariya, south of Baghdad, killing at least five people and injuring seven, including policemen, an Iraqi police source said.
The gunmen had attacked electricity workers who were conducting maintenance operations on the road between Mahawil and Iskandariya cities in Hillah, 100 kilometres south of the capital, the source added.
Casualties, according to the Iraqi police, were expected to rise on both sides.
Meanwhile, US-led coalition forces killed three terrorist suspects and detained 16 others during operations Thursday morning targeting al-Qaeda in Iraq, the US military reported.
During an operation west of Ramadi, 110 kilometres west of Baghdad, coalition forces killed two terrorists and detained six others.
South of Baghdad, coalition forces killed one armed terrorist who charged at them as they entered a targeted building.
Six suspected terrorists allegedly associated with al-Qaeda in Iraq were also detained in operations in Bayji, north of Baghdad, and four others with alleged ties to foreign fighter facilitation were detained in Ramadi.
In other news, a US marine was killed Wednesday in Anbar province, the US military reported Thursday.
Kurdish demonstrators forced their way into the United Nations building here on Thursday in protest at the reported poisoning of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Around 20 demonstrators barged past UN security guards and into the main courtyard of the Palais des Nations before being ejected.
Ocalan's been poisoned, that's why we're here, one demonstrator, who gave his name as Erdam, told AFP.
Kurds from all over Switzerland had gathered in protest, he added.
Ocalan is the head of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting an armed separatist campaign against Ankara since 1984. 
He has been in jail in Turkey since 1999.
His lawyers in Rome on Thursday claimed he has been poisoned in jail, and demanded the UN send a medical team to investigate.
Ocalan's defence team showed reporters in the Italian capital the results of tests indicating the presence of what they said were toxic metals in the Kurdish leader's hair.
Italian lawyer Giuliano Pisapia said Ocalan was suffering a progressive poisoning and ruled out the possibility that the metals had entered his body naturally. 
There are only two other possibilities poisoning through his food or through his water, he told a press conference.
Lawyer Mahmut Sakar called on the United Nations and the Council of Europe to send an independent medical delegation to examine the PKK chief.
A shootout shook a village in Georgia just across the border from breakaway Abkhazia on Thursday, days before parliamentary polls in the separatist region, a representative of the Georgian interior ministry said.
Shota Utiashvili said Abkhaz gunmen opened fire on activists from a Georgian non-governmental organisation after they held a media briefing in protest against the elections due on March 4.
As far as we know, they gathered journalists to tell them they would boycott the parliamentary polls, Utiashvili said.
Georgian police returned fire in the clash which lasted half an hour to an hour, he told Reuters. 
Three activists who had crossed from Abkhazia for the meeting were detained by Abkhaz police, he said.
Shooting between gunmen from Abkhazia and Georgian police breaks out sporadically on the de facto border and casualties are recorded every few months.
Utiashvili said no information was available on casualties. 
One Georgian television channel said several people had been wounded.
Abkhaz Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba told Georgian television, There was no shooting at all.
The speaker of Georgia's parliament Nino Burjanadze called the shootout another provocation from the Abkhaz side.
The pro-Tbilisi government of Abkhazia fled during fighting in 1992-93 when separatists drove out Georgian forces.
Based since then in the Georgian capital, it has no real power.
South Ossetia, another breakaway region along Georgia's northern border with Russia, last year voted in a referendum for independence.
An Indian state on Friday rejected a proposal by prostitutes to pay tax to the government in return for stopping police raids on brothels and checks on soliciting clients.
Officials in the eastern state of West Bengal said since prostitution was illegal, the government could not tax sex workers.
Tomorrow, criminals will say we will pay taxes so don't catch us, Raj Kanojia, a top state police officer, said.
On Thursday, the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) an umbrella group of 65,000 sex workers in West Bengal announced that prostitutes would charge clients extra to help them pay tax.
Even if we collect one rupee from each client it would boost the exchequer, Smarajit Jana, DMSC's chief adviser, said. 
Let the government collect taxes legally, as prostitutes in any case pay the police hefty amounts to get away.
About four million clients visit red light areas under the control of DMSC every month in West Bengal.
Sex workers say they are harassed by police and picked up from brothels, hotels and nightclubs and jailed. 
They often have to pay bribes to officers to continue working.
Under Indian law, sex workers cannot solicit customers in public.
Authorities tolerate brothels in some areas although police often raid them to rescue minors or to prevent women from being forced into the profession.
Israeli troops on Friday detained a fifteen-year-old boy at its border with Lebanon, a spokesman of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said.
The Israeli Army confirmed that they are holding in custody a man detained Friday near the technical fence, east of the southern Lebanese (village of) Houla, Liam McDowall said.
We are following the matter, he added without elaborating.
Lebanese police identified the boy as Mahmoud Hussein Hajj, a resident of Houla.
The police could not confirm whether the boy was detained on the Lebanese or the Israeli side of the border.
Unidentified gunmen on motorcycles shot at a crowd of supporters of fired Ecuadorean lawmakers, injuring two people on Tuesday and escalating violence in a feud between Congress and the president, witnesses said on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear how seriously the two had been hurt in the politically unstable Andean nation. 
The shots were fired outside a hotel only hours after fired lawmakers scuffled with police and forced their way into Congress.
A group of unknown assailants on motorcycles shot at our supporters outside. 
There are two people hurt, said opposition lawmaker Clemente Vasquez who was inside the hotel. 
Witnesses and legislators said no lawmaker had been hurt.
Fifty-seven lawmakers have refused to accept an electoral court decision to fire them last week. 
They had tried to reverse a ruling that would allow the popular President Rafael Correa to hold a referendum that would weaken Congressional powers.
A massive explosion in a shop shook the Afghan capital Kabul early Wednesday, killing four people and wounding up to nine, police said.
They said the blast was caused by exploding gunpowder but an intelligence officer said it was a bomb. 
Afghan soldiers, police and firefighters poured into the area.
The blast took place in a bazaar where hunting rifles, gunpowder and bullets are sold, on the other side of the Kabul River from the presidential palace and defence ministry.
Four people have been martyred and nine others are wounded, Abdul Rahman Rahimi, the police commander for the district, told AFP.
Lots of shops and some houses have been destroyed or damaged due to the strong waves of the explosion, he said.
The explosion destroyed a row of mudbrick shops and left a three-metre (10-foot) crater in the ground, an AFP reporter at the scene said.
People combed through the debris with their bare hands and shovels to recover bodies.
We heard a huge explosion from one of the shops, said Ahmad Fahim, who runs a bakery in the area. 
There were people in most of the shops. 
There are still bodies underneath the rubble.
A police colonel at the site who did not want to be named said the type of explosion and the size of the crater suggested dynamite was involved.
It seems that a big amount of gunpowder and some dynamite, which people use for illegal mining, were stored here.
The blast sent a column of dust and smoke into the air. 
NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) could not immediately confirm what had caused the explosion.
We heard the blast, we went outside and we saw a huge plume of smoke about half a mile south, ISAF spokesman Colonel Tom Collins told AFP.
Kabul was last year rocked by a series of explosions, including several suicide bombings, but has not seen any attacks this year.
The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog will hold two rounds of talks with North Korea's top nuclear negotiator on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for a visitingdelegation of the International Atomic Energy Agency told Kyodo News in a telephone interview.
A meeting between IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei, who arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday, and North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan is scheduled in the morning and the other in the afternoon, according to the spokeswoman.
Lebanese police discovered Wednesday a bomb without a detonator near the residence of an official who belongs to the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), which is headed by prominent anti-Syrian Druze Leader, Walid Jumblatt.
The bomb was placed near the residence of the vice president of the PSP, Douard Yagi, in the city of Baalbeck, a Lebanese security official said.
This is a message sent to the PSP and its leader Walid Jumblatt, Yagi said. 
Jumblatt is an an outspoken critic of Syria.
In the past few weeks, the Lebanese authorities have discovered several explosives planted in various areas.
On Tuesday, Lebanese Interior Minister Hassan Sabaa said that a terrorist network loyal to Syria admitted it was behind a double bus bombing on February 13 that killed three people and wounded 20.
At least 21 people were killed after flash floods and lightning hit their houses in three Yemeni provinces during the past three days, police sources said Monday.
The sources said floods triggered by heavy rain left 15 people dead in the eastern province of Hadhramout. 
In the central province of Ibb, a man, a woman and a child were killed after floods lashed their areas, police said.
Three people were killed by lightning in mountainous areas in the western province of Mahweet.
Floods also destroyed dozens of homes, farms and roads in the three provinces and other southern and eastern provinces which received heavy rain in recent days.
Floods brought by heavy seasonal rain are common in the impoverished Arab country, where dozens of people are killed every year in incidents caused by rains during spring and summer.
Chinese President Hu Jintao left Beijing on Mar. 26 for a three-day visit to     Russia     at the invitation of his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
President Hu told reporters before departure that he hoped the visit would achieve substantial fruits and inject new motivity into the development of China-Russia comprehensive ties.
During the visit, President Hu will hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The two sides will discuss the coordination of action between China and Russia in the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue and the     Iran nuclear issue, bilateral cooperation within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), and other regional and international affairs.
The two sides will also focus their discussion on the China-Russia economic cooperation, especially in energy.
On the occasion, the two sides will sign a joint statement and agreements on cooperation in banking, transportation and other fields, worth nearly 4 billion USD.
During President Hu's stay in Russia, the Chinese side will organise a largest-ever trade exhibition in Moscow with the participation of about 200 Chinese groups and companies.
Two-way trade between China and Russia reached 33.4 billion USD in 2006, an increase of nearly 15 percent against the previous year. 
It is expected to attain between 60-80 billion USD by 2010.
Top Indian and Pakistani defence officials were to hold talks here Friday on the demilitarisation of a glacier in Kashmir where freezing temperatures have claimed more lives than actual combat.
India has said that iron-clad evidence of Pakistani military positions in the 6,300-metre (20,800-feet) Siachen glacier area of the disputed region is needed before demilitarisation of the world's highest battlefield can begin.
A nine-member Indian delegation led by Defence Secretary Shekhar Dutt arrived in Pakistan late Thursday for talks with Dutt's newly appointed Pakistani counterpart, Kamran Rasool. 
The two-day talks were due to start at 1030 am (0530 GMT), an official said.
These parleys are the part of the ongoing process of composite dialogue between the two countries for resolution of all the outstanding issues, an official Pakistani statement said.
The composite dialogue is the official term for the peace process launched by the nuclear-armed rivals in January 2004, centring on their six-decade dispute over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday called a meeting of his security cabinet to chalk out a framework for the Siachen talks.
Singh later told reporters in New Delhi that he was hopeful of a positive outcome when asked about his expectations of the meeting, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
There are immense opportunities. 
We are working together to resolve our differences, Singh said.
Pakistan, which like India claims all of Kashmir, is said to fear that setting out its positions would be tacit acceptance of India's claims to Siachen and the area as a whole.
The two countries have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.
Six NATO-led soldiers died from injuries sustained Sunday in a mine explosion in southern Afghanistan, the alliance force said in a statement.
Six ISAF soldiers died today in Southern Afghanistan as a result of injuries sustained when the vehicle they were traveling in hit an explosive device, the International Security Assistance Force said in a statement.
The latest casualties brought to seven the number of ISAF soldiers killed on Sunday.
One ISAF soldier was killed and two others were wounded in a separate but similar blast in southern Afghanistan Sunday morning.
The ISAF, in line with to its policies, would not provide information on the exact location of the incidents or reveal the nationalities of the dead soldiers, leaving it to relevant national authorities to do so.
An ISAF vehicle was also damaged in the second blast, the statement said.
The Iraqi army on Sunday was handed a British army base in the city of Basra, 550 kilometres south of Baghdad.
The Iraqi flag was ceremoniously hoisted over the base, one month after another base in central Basra was given to the Iraqi army forces.
The handover comes as part of a phased partial troop withdrawal from Iraq, which was announced on February 21 by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
Under the plan, by the end of this summer the troop numbers will be down to 5,000.
Currently, around 7,100 British troops remain in Iraq, with large bases in the south - mainly in Basra and Amarah.
Meanwhile, Adel Muhajir, governor of Amarah, around 390 kilometres south of the capital, said that local forces were ready to take over security from the multi-national forces in the city.
A 15-year-old Egyptian girl has tested positive for bird flu, the official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported on Sunday, becoming the 34th human case in the country and the first in the capital.
A Health Ministry spokesman identified the girl as Marianna Kameel Mikhail from Cairo's Shubra district, MENA reported.
The girl was admitted to hospital on Thursday suffering from a high fever and is now being treated with Tamiflu and is in a stable condition, the agency said. 
She contracted the virus after coming into contact with infected birds, MENA quoted the ministry spokesman as saying.
Egypt has the highest number of confirmed human bird flu cases outside Asia, and 13 Egyptians have died of bird flu since it first surfaced in the country's poultry a year ago.
Most of those who fell ill were reported to have had contact with sick or dead household birds, mainly in northern Egypt.
Thousands of supporters of Iraq's radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr on Sunday prepared to stage a massive anti-US rally on Monday's fourth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad, police said.
Police Colonel Ali Jiraou confirmed that thousands of Sadr movement members were in Najaf south of Baghdad and that security measures were being made to protect them.
Hundreds of Iraqi flags were raised over government buildings in Najaf and in public squares, according to an AFP journalist.
The demonstration is scheduled to begin on Monday outside Sadr's mosque in Kufa and proceed into the twin Shiite shrine city of Najaf, a member of Sadr's office in Najaf told AFP on condition of anonymity.
He said thousands of Sadr sympathisers were travelling to Najaf to join the demonstration against the US-led foreign occupation of Iraq.
It will be an Iraqi demonstration in the name of all Iraqis. 
We will raise the Iraqi flag and also banners demanding that the occupation leave, he said.
Oudha Mohammed, a representative of Sadr in the southern Shiite city of Basra, said thousands of residents had left for Najaf following Sadr's call to demonstrate against the occupation.
A spokesman for Najaf governorate, Ahmed Duaibil, confirmed that a joint committee of Sadr supporters and provincial administrators would be set up to ensure the safety of protesters.
On March 30, Sheikh Abdul Hadi al-Muhamadawi, speaking on behalf of Sadr in Kufa, urged Iraqis to protest on April 9, the fourth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad and the overthrow of former president Saddam Hussein.
Sadr, whose Mahdi Army militia is branded the most dangerous element in Iraq by the Pentagon and whom the Americans believe has fled to Iran, has always demanded that US troops leave the country.
Chinese navy and Zhejiang marine police rescue teams searched the East China Sea for 20 crew from a cargo ship that collided with another ship and sank on Sunday, state media reported.
The Belize-registered Harvest sank off the coast of Zhejiang province, Xinhua News Agency reported late on Sunday, quoting local marine police from Zhejiang province. 
The ship was carrying 5,000 tonnes of steel from Shanghai to Vietnam.
All the crew members aboard -- 19 Chinese and one Indonesian -- were missing, Xinhua said.
The other ship, a 17,061-tonnne Chinese vessel, was sailing from Fuzhou, the capital of southeastern Fujian province, to Zhangjiagang in Jiangsu Province. 
The report did not say whether that ship was damaged.
Bangladesh's last prime minister Khaleda Zia has agreed to demands from the country's military-backed authorities that she leave by April 22, an aide said Wednesday.
Zia is one of the highest-profile figures to be targeted by emergency-ruled Bangladesh's interim government, in the midst of a major crackdown on corruption and clean-up of the country's political system.
She has been asked to leave the country by April 22, a close aide told AFP on condition he not be named. 
He added she would leave the country for Saudi Arabia before the deadline on Sunday.
Officials and close aides to Zia said earlier she had agreed to leave quietly in return for leniency for her two sons, both of whom faced graft and extortion charges.
The Amar Desh Bengali-language daily, which is owned by Zia's political secretary, reported Wednesday that she would leave with the family of her younger son Arafat Rahman.
The Ittefaq newspaper also said Zia, 61, and six members of her family had received visas from the Saudia Arabian embassy.
Zia was prime minister until her five-year term ended in October and together with her arch rival Sheikh Hasina Wajed has been blamed for steering the country into political chaos.
The two women have ruled the country alternately since democracy was reintroduced in 1991.
A military-backed interim government took power in January after President Iajuddin Ahmed declared a state of emergency and cancelled planned elections following months of political violence between loyalists of the two women.
An ensuing crackdown has seen dozens of top officials from Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Sheikh Hasina's Awami League arrested. 
Zia herself has been under virtual house arrest since last week.
A Cuban dissident living in Bolivia who openly criticized the South American country's closer ties with Cuba was deported to Colombia on Tuesday, a Bolivian government official said.
Amauris Samartino, who arrived in Bolivia in 2000, was detained in late December on charges he violated a Bolivian law prohibiting foreign nationals from interfering in Bolivia's internal affairs.
The government moved to deport him after a state-owned television station showed Samartino shouting anti-government slogans at a rally against leftist President Evo Morales.
Colombia will be a temporary destination. 
Later he could be sent to Switzerland, Bolivia's Human Rights Ombudsman Waldo Albarracin told reporters.
The Bolivian government turned to the UNHCR, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, for help in finding a country that would accept Samartino after both Cuba and the United States refused to take him.
Bolivian officials have said that Samartino and 11 other Cubans who entered the country in October 2000 after fleeing to the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo did not have political refugee status.
Two Royal Air Force helicopters from a base in central England have collided, the Ministry of Defence said.

No more details were released.
Royal Nepal Airlines has apologized to Peru after mistakenly using a photo of the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu to promote tourism in Nepal.
Peru's foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday the flagship carrier of the Himalayan kingdom, about half way around the world from the Andean country, had put the picture of Peru's tourism icon, Machu Picchu, on a poster under a slogan Have you seen Nepal
Peruvian mountaineer Ernesto Malaga, who was visiting India last month, noticed the blunder on a poster hanging on a wall in the airline's office in New Delhi. 
Peruvian authorities requested explanations from the airline via the embassy.
The airline  offered apologies to Peru for using the picture of the Machu Picchu Sanctuary on a poster to promote their country and assured that the lamentable error has been corrected, the statement said.
As a consequence, the Nepalese airline fired an employee in the rank of a manager  It is concluded that it was an isolated error, it added.
From a distance, some mountain temples in the Himalayas could be mistaken for Incan ruins, which also cling to steep slopes.
Nepal is actively promoting tourism in the hope that foreigners will return in big numbers to visit its snow-capped mountains and ancient temples after a long Maoist revolt.
In the meantime, Peru's government is urging residents and visitors to vote for the Andean Machu Picchu site as one of the world's new seven wonders in a publicity campaign by the New7Wonders Foundation.
Built in the 1460s and abandoned for three centuries after the Spanish conquest, Machu Picchu, or Old Peak in the Quechua language, was rediscovered by U.S. archeologist Hiram Bingham in 1911.
The percentage of Americans who are dieting is at its lowest in at least 16 years even though a majority of adults say they would like to lose 20 pounds (9 kg), according to a study released on Wednesday.
Baby boomers are making their own dieting decisions rather than relying on medical advice, said Harry Balzer, author of the study by research firm NPD Group.
This is a time in life where health issues begin to creep into our lives and in the past, doctors provided advice, said Balzer, NPD vice president.
It appears people in this age group today are either not getting  or not listening to  their doctor's advice, he added in a statement.
According to the survey, in the 12 months ended in February 2006, 26 percent of women and 19 percent of men in the United States said they were on a diet. 
That's down from 35 percent of women and 26 percent of men in 1990.
Still, 60 percent of U.S. adults say they would like to lose 20 pounds, the study said.
In 2006, the most popular diet in the United States was a self-made regimen, the study said. 
The second-most followed diet was one prescribed by a doctor and the third was Weight Watchers.
Government health officials estimate about 60 percent of the adult population is overweight with the number of those considered obese on the rise over the past decade.
A recent survey by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 23.9 percent of U.S. adults are obese, up from 15.6 percent in 1995 and 19.8 percent in 2000.
Member countries of the Jeddah-based Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) are lagging behind other countries in science and technology. 
According to a recent report released by the OIC, which groups 57 Muslim countries, only three countries among the OIC members produce high technology products for export, while Turkey, Egypt and Uzbekistan have topped patents granted for technology. 
India surpasses all OIC members in science and technology. 
The report showed that Pakistan is advancing in nuclear energy technology, Malaysia in space science, Turkey in automobiles and Saudi Arabia in petrochemicals.
OIC Assistant Secretary General for Science and Technology Dr. Ali Akbar Salehi said that most member States are allocating minimum funds for science and technology. 
The average allocation for all member States collectively is 0.66 per cent which is far behind the world average rate of 36.2 per cent, the OIC official said.
Up to 11 people were killed in clashes in Guinea's capital on Monday between police and protesters supporting a general strike aimed at ousting President Lansana Conte, a hospital doctor said.
There are at least 100 injured. 
The number of dead can be estimated at 11, but we have to finalise the count. 
The injured are still coming in, the doctor at the Donka Hospital in Conakry, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
A police source said elite army units, including members of the presidential guard wearing red berets, fired into the air to disperse protesters trying to march towards the city centre.
We've managed to disperse them, the source said, without mentioning casualties.
The clashes in Conakry came on the 13th day of a general strike launched by union leaders who say Conte, a reclusive diabetic in his 70s, is unfit to rule and should step aside.
The stoppage turned violent last week and before Monday's deaths, at least eight people had already been killed in clashes across the West African country.
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso said the six-party talks could resume early February, local media reported Tuesday.
Aso said that the negotiations to disband North Korea's nuclear weapons programmes should be reopened in the first two weeks of February, at the earliest, according to Jiji Press.
It is essential for the participating states to commit themselves to accomplishing concrete plans of denuclearization of North Korea before they set the date, added Aso.
Japan's lead nuclear negotiator Kenichiro Sasae and his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei are expected to meet Wednesday and set the date of the talks, Aso was quoted as saying.
A suicide attacker blew himself up near a NATO base in eastern Afghanistan early Tuesday, missing foreign soldiers but causing a number of other casualties, the NATO-led force and police said.
The attacker struck near the Salerno base of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) near the eastern city of Khost.
There was an explosion in the vicinity of Salerno early this morning in Khost province. 
There were no ISAF casualties. 
However we are aware of a number of other casualties, an ISAF spokeswoman told AFP.
Police said the number of casualties was not yet clear.
The suicide bombing was in front of a base of the coalition forces, police spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP in Kabul.
On casualties, he said: We cannot say  the area was blocked by the coalition forces and no one was allowed in.
Suicide attacks are a hallmark of the Taliban-led insurgency that kicked off when the hardline Islamic movement was driven from power in 2001.
There were nearly 140 such attacks in the country last year, according to US officials. 
They were mostly aimed at foreign and Afghan forces, but killed more civilians.
German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Monday that the European Union is ready for talks with Tehran to resolve the nuclear issue.
Germany currently holds the six-month rotating EU Presidency. 
We have linked this to our preparedness to entertain a double- track approach. 
We will be available if we see movement on the Iranian side. 
So the Iranians know and have known for some months what they need to do, added the German minister.
The EU ministers backed the resolution 1737 and reiterated at the same time their support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to Iran's nuclear issue.
Actor Ryan O'Neil, star of the Oscar-winning 1970 hit film Love Story, was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon after shooting a gun inside his house during a fight with his son, Hollywood media reported.
O'Neil, 65, was arrested early Saturday after the fight with his son Griffin, 42, in his Malibu, California home, movie star website TMZ.com reported, citing police sources.
The website said he was booked at the Lost Hills sheriff's office and released a few hours later after posting bail of 50,000 dollars.
It also said that a 22-year-old woman, a friend of O'Neil's son, was inadvertently injured during the fight and taken to a local hospital. 
But there was no information on what caused the injury or her condition.
O'Neil was nominated for an Academy Award for the classic tear-jerker Love Story, which ultimately won one Oscar out of many nominations for best music from an original score.
Most recently he has been seen in a number of television appearances, including in the hit Desperate Housewives.
Confectionery giant Masterfoods, which owns the Mars and Snickers candy bar brand names, has said it will stop marketing its core products to children under the age of 12 by the end of this year, the Financial Times reported on Monday.
Citing a letter to the European Commission's director-general for health and consumer protection Robert Madelin, the business daily said that the policy will apply to all advertising, including online and new media.
We have decided to make an official policy change to a cut-off age of 12 years for all our core products, a Masterfoods letter to Madelin read, according to the FT.
Core products reportedly include snack foods and confectionery.
The newspaper said that while Masterfoods already had a policy of not advertising to children younger than six, rivals Nestle and PepsiCo do not have a global age limit for targeting children.
According to the FT, CadburySchweppes does not advertise to children less than eight, while Kraft does not advertise to children younger than six, though it said that it only markets better for you products such as fruit juices and wheat crackers to children between six and 11.
Israeli troops arrested three Palestinians in the occupied West Bank overnight after they tried to kidnap an Israeli hitchhiker, an army spokeswoman said Monday.
The three were captured after the attempted kidnap near the Jewish settlement of Eli close to the Palestinian West Bank political headquarters of Ramallah.
An Israeli civilian managed to escape and alerted the army who searched the area and set up checkpoints before arresting the attackers, who were carrying weapons and amunition, the spokeswoman said.
Israeli public radio said the three detainees belonged to the radical Islamist movement Hamas, which heads the Palestinian government.
Fighters from the group's armed wing helped to capture an Israeli soldier near the Gaza Strip last June, precipitating months of military operations in the territory although the conscript has yet to be recovered.
Israeli soldiers also arrested another 15 wanted Palestinian suspects overnight elsewhere in the West Bank, the spokeswoman said.
A remote-controlled bomb killed two pro-government tribal elders and wounded another on Monday near Pakistan's northwestern border with Afghanistan, security officials said.
The officials said the elders were apparently targeted for supporting Islamabad's efforts to purge the semi-autonomous frontier region of Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants who fled Afghanistan in 2001.
The blast happened when the trio left a house in Charmang Seddah Shah village, near Khar, the main town in the Bajaur tribal region, to go to a nearby market, they said.
It was an act of terrorism, one of the security officials told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Pakistan has come under fire for failing to tackle Islamic insurgents who took shelter in the tribal zone after US-led forces invaded Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States.
President Pervez Musharraf on Friday admitted that some border guards had turned a blind eye to militants crossing the frontier to launch attacks on NATO and US-led forces in Afghanistan.
A military airstrike on an Islamic religious school in Bajaur in October 2006 left 80 people dead. 
Officials said it was an Al-Qaeda training camp but locals said the victims were students.
An alleged CIA missile strike in another part of Bajaur killed 18 people in January 2006. 
Al-Qaeda's Egyptian deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was said to have escaped the attack.
The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was named a distinguished professor at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, the first time the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner has accepted a university appointment, Emory announced Monday.
Emory, which has a prominent Tibetan studies program conducted in relation to Tibetan Buddhist institutes in India, said in a statement that the Dalai Lama would deliver an inaugural lecture during an October 20-22 visit to the university.
As Presidential Distinguished Professor, the Dalai Lama will continue to provide private teaching sessions with students and faculty during Emory's study-abroad program in Dharamsala (India), as well as provide opportunities for university community members to attend his annual teachings, the university said.
Emory said that aside from the Dalai Lama's offering teaching sessions for Emory students at Emory and in India, the university will establish a fellowship in his name to fund scholarships for Tibetan students enrolling in Emory.
I firmly believe that education is an indispensable tool for the flourishing of human well-being and the creation of a just and peaceful society, and I am delighted to make a small contribution in this regard through this appointment, the Dalai Lama said in the statement.
The Dalai Lama, 71, set up a Tibetan government in exile in Dharamsala in 1959 after fleeing Tibet in the wake of China's takeover.
Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz reminded Tuesday the rival Palestinian Fatah and Hamas movements of their obligations towards God, Islam and Arabism.
Leaders of the two movements were due to meet Tuesday in Mecca at the invitation of the Saudi king to discuss means of ending bloody internecine violence between them.
The monarch's statement came as part of a reply to Palestinians living in Saudi Arabia who had earlier Monday sent him a message.
The Palestinians, who met at the Palestinian embassy in Riyadh Monday evening, said they hope the meeting of the leaders would lead to the end of bloodshed and pave the way for a national unified Palestinian government.
They called on Palestinian leaders not to leave the meeting without reaching a conclusive agreement as well as stopping the bloodshed, which benefits only the Palestinian nation's enemies.
In his reply the Saudi king called on Palestinian leaders to listen to the voice of wisdom derived from Islamic sharia (Islamic law) through a free, honest dialogue, not fighting.
The European Commission on Wednesday said it was sending some 600,000 euros (778,000 dollars) in emergency aid to help the victims of ongoing floods in Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
EU funds will be used to provide some 340,000 most affected people with food, clean water, emergency shelter and health services.
The commission said that it was concerned about epidemic disease outbreaks due to the consumption and usage of contaminated water.
More than 73,000 houses are inundated and clean water supplies have been cut to about 500,000 people, it warned.
Help projects will be carried out by international humanitarian workers on the ground, the EU executive said.
The EU's decision came as the death toll from massive floods in Jakarta rose to 44 on Tuesday and 12 people were killed in neighbouring Banten and West Java provinces when heavy rains triggered a landslide and flash floods.
The floods began last Thursday after torrential monsoon rains submerged up to 75 per cent of the city and displaced more than 340,000 people in the greater Jakarta region, where more than 18 million live.
An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 hit Japan's northern island of Hokkaido on Saturday, the Meteorological Agency said. 
But there were no reports of damage or casualties.
The agency said the quake, which struck southeastern Hokkaido, about 900 km (560 miles) north of Tokyo, at 09:03 a.m. (0003 GMT) on Saturday, would not trigger tsunami.
Japan sits at the junction of at least three tectonic plates, immense slabs of the earth's crust whose gradual movements are thought to cause earthquakes, making it one of the world's most earthquake-prone regions.
A New York businessman was indicted on terrorism charges on Friday, accused of transferring $152,000 to fund the purchase of equipment for use in a militant training camp in Afghanistan.
Abdul Tawala Ibn Ali Alishtari was charged with financing terrorism and with money laundering for accepting an unspecified payment to secretly transfer $152,000 for equipment including night-vision goggles in the second half of 2006, said an indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
One such transfer by Alishtari, also known as Michael Mixon, included $25,000 from a New York bank account to a bank account in Montreal, Canada, the indictment said.
Alishtari, 53, a U.S. citizen born in the United States, was arrested on Thursday in Manhattan and detained after a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Friday, authorities said.
He was also charged with wire fraud for running an investment program called the Flat Electronic Data Interchange between 1998 and 2004, according to the indictment. 
It attracted millions of dollars in investments by falsely promising high rates of return, the indictment said.
If convicted, he faces a maximum combined sentence of 95 years in prison.
A lawyer for Alishtari could not be immediately reached.
US President George W. Bush on Friday discussed the situation in the Middle East with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, the White House said.
The telephone talks came just before US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice headed to the Middle East to host a rare summit between Israeli and Palestinian leaders that she hopes will break new ground in reviving peace negotiations frozen for nearly seven years.
Monday's meeting with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and Olmert was the focus of Bush's talks with the Israeli prime minister, the White House said in a statement.
Bush also discussed the situation in Iraq and developments in Israeli-Palestinian affairs with the Saudi king, the White House added.
Rice has in recent months heralded the existence of a new opening for progress towards Israeli-Arab peace and the creation of an independent state for Palestinians, and has billed Monday's summit in Jerusalem as a high-profile jump through that breach.
At least 11 people,including a judge, were killed by a bomb blast in a courtroom in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta on Saturday, according to a doctor at a hospital where casualties were taken.
Eleven people have been killed, including senior civil judge Abdul Wahid Durrani, Dr. Abdullah, at the district hospital, told Reuters.
Police said the blast was caused by a bomb that went off while the court was in session.
Four people drowned and 20 more were feared dead after a bus in eastern India fell into a river after colliding with a truck on Saturday, police said.
The accident took place on a bridge in Keonjhar district, 270 km (170 miles) north of Bhubaneswar, capital of Orissa state.
At least 20 (more) people could have drowned after the bus fell into the river, Bijoy Murmu, a senior police official said from Keonjhar.
Around 30 people were rescued but 15 of them were in critical condition at a local hospital.
There were well over 50 people in the bus, police said.
Buses and trucks are often driven recklessely in India, where highway regulations are regularly flouted.
Police in India's northern state of Uttarakhand Sunday arrested a man carrying a homemade pistol as he tried to enter a rally which was to be addressed by Sonia Gandhi, chief of India's ruling alliance, media reports said.
Kedar Singh was arrested by the police hours before Gandhi was to speak at the rally in Almora town, during her campaign tour for the Congress party in the local polls, the PTI news agency reported.
Almora is 180 kilometres south-east of state capital Dehradun.
Police officials said the man who was in his mid-40s was being interrogated but it was not clear if he wanted to harm Gandhi.
We are verifying reports regarding his identity, senior police official Satish Shukla was quoted by the news agency as saying.
The incident prompted the Uttarakhand police to sound a high-alert in the state.
Gandhi is one of India's most heavily guarded political personalities and Indian intelligence agencies have said that several militant groups could target her.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice meets Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Monday in a bid to restart the Mideast peace process that has been overshadowed by how to deal with a new Palestinian unity government.
Rice is to hold a three-way meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas after spending the weekend shuttling between the two sides holding talks she described as extensive, cordial and candid.
Israeli commandos disguised as Palestinians killed an Islamic Jihad commander and two activists in Jenin on Wednesday in a new crackdown in the north of the occupied West Bank.
Israel also relaunched a massive hunt for activists in Nablus, south of Jenin, sending in around 100 jeeps and armoured vehicles, just 24 hours after withdrawing from the West Bank's second-largest city after a two-day siege.
The Palestinians have condemned the Israeli operations, saying they threatened US-led efforts to rekindle the long-stalled peace process.
In Jenin, the undercover force opened fire on a car carrying the guerrillas, killing Ashraf al-Saadi (25), a senior Jihad leader in the West Bank, and Alaa Breiki (26), Palestinian security sources said.
A third activist, Mohammad Abu Naasa (22), was wounded, but a soldier finished him off with a bullet to the head, witnesses said.
One of the soldiers took out his pistol and shot him in the head, said a witness, declining to be named.
An Israeli security source said the two were instantly killed in a car. 
The third was wounded, stepped out of the car, opened fire at the soldiers and was shot down.
The soldiers came to Jenin intending to arrest the activists and opened fire only after the gunmen spotted the undercover unit and fired at it, the source said.
Al-Saadi identified them and fired, lightly wounding one soldier, the source said. 
The troops opened fire and killed them. 
The trio was involved in planning and carrying out attacks against the army and planning suicide bombings, the source said.
Adding that the cell was also behind an attempted suicide bombing in Tel Aviv last week.
After the shooting, around 30 army jeeps moved into Jenin's refugee camp to carry out house-to-house searches for other militants. 
They left after several hours.
Islamic Jihad responded by launching five rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip, causing minor damage to a fence in the Negev desert, according to army radio. 
Fresh fighting in northern and eastern Sri Lanka left at least 21 rebels dead, while a ship believed to be carrying military hardware for the rebels was blown up off the southern coast of the country, a military spokesman said Wednesday.
At least 18 rebels were killed when two boats were destroyed Tuesday night off the Pulmoddai area, 360 kilometres north-east of the capital, military spokesman Major S Rajapakse said.
Two sailors were injured in the incident, he added.
On Wednesday morning a ship believed to be carrying military hardware for the Tamil rebels was sunk off the southern coast, the spokesman said.
The ship, sighted 180 nautical miles off the southern coast of Matara, was fired upon by the Sri Lankan navy after it ignored orders to halt.
There was also return fire from the ship and they were believed to be carrying weapons for the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam), he said.
Rajapakse added that several explosions were observed aboard the vessel after it sustained hits by the naval bombardment, leading to speculation that explosives were among the ship's cargo.
The navy during the past four years has destroyed at least five ships carrying military hardware for the rebels.
Meanwhile, three more rebels were killed in a confrontation with Police Special Task Force (STF) commandos in Kallady, Batticaloa, 250 kilometres east of the capital Wednesday morning.
The STF recovered a T-56 automatic weapon, four magazines, a claymore mine and four hand grenades after the attack.
The fighting comes a day after rebels launched a mortar attack at a group of diplomats visiting the eastern part of the country, injuring the Italian Ambassador Pio Mariani and 11 others.
Negotiators from North and South Korea haggled Thursday over food aid, family reunions and other topics as their first high-level talks since the North's nuclear test went into a third day.
At the meeting in Pyongyang the impoverished North has asked its wealthy neighbour to resume crucial food aid, which was suspended in protest at the communist state's nuclear and missile programmes.
The North started to raise the issue of humanitarian aid during working-level officials' meetings on Wednesday. 
But the details have yet to be worked out for a joint statement, a South Korean official told Seoul's Yonhap news agency on condition of anonymity.
The South wants to use its food and fertiliser aid as leverage to press the North to honour a six-nation deal to scrap its nuclear programme, according to sources quoted by Yonhap.
Working groups Thursday were continuing negotiations on how to resume aid, family reunions and inter-Korean economic projects, according to pool reports from Seoul's domestic media.
At the first full session Wednesday Kwon Ho-ung, the North's top negotiator, proposed resuming humanitarian projects on a full scale immediately. 
He did not specify them but the comments were seen as a reference to food aid and the reunions, with the latter possibly conditional on the former.
The South suspended its annual shipments of 500,000 tons of rice and 350,000 tons of fertiliser after the North's missile tests last July. 
The North hit back by walking out of ministerial talks that month and halting the reunions.
The October nuclear test further strained ties.
The curent Seoul government is committed to engagement and reconcilation with its neighbour. 
But it is under domestic pressure not to give away too much without getting something in return.
Seoul may offer to ship some fertiliser shortly after these talks, in time for the spring rice planting, said sources quoted by Yonhap. 
But they said it would try to link additional aid to progress in nuclear disarmament.
It was unclear if the North would accept any linkage to disarmament. 
Negotiator Kwon Wednesday rejected criticism by Seoul's Unification Minister Lee Jae-Joung of the missile tests, saying they were part of a sovereign nation's legitimate right to self-defence.
A senior unification ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that unlike previous ministerial talks, these involve the dual tracks of inter-Korean relations and the six-party talks, so difficult negotiations are ahead.
The North agreed at the six-nation talks in Beijing last month to disable its nuclear programme in exchange for economic aid and diplomatic benefits.
It has taken some first steps, inviting the head of the UN atomic agency to visit and sending its own chief nuclear negotiator to the United States for talks.
But analysts have warned that unconditional aid from South Korea could reduce the North's incentive to honour the Beijing accord.
South Korea's five chief negotiators were due Thursday afternoon to pay a courtesy call on Kim Yong-Nam, the North's ceremonial head of state, officials said.
As a goodwill gesture the hosts laid on a birthday breakfast for chief negotiator Lee, who turned 63 on Thursday.
US troops in Iraq have six months to create order or will face a Vietnam-style collapse forcing it into a hasty retreat, British newspapers reported Thursday.
They were quoting a report allegedly compiled by top advisers working for General David Petraeus, the US commander in Baghdad.
According to the reports, the so-called Baghdad brains trust, a group of officers and counter-insurgency experts hand-picked by Petraeus, has warned that the situation in Iraq was deteriorating and that US troops could face the prospect of a humiliating withdrawal.
The team was said to be aware that the US probably had no longer than six months to restore order in Iraq, otherwise Washington would implement Plan B2 a hasty pullout leaving the divided country to its fate, The Times said.
They know they are operating under a clock. They know the next six-month period is their opportunity. And they say it's getting harder every day, the Guardian quoted a former senior administration official as saying.
The group is said to have advised Petraeus that events on the ground conspired against the mission, citing obstacles such as insufficient troops, wavering coalition partners and a deterioration of troop morale.
The experts predicted an upsurge of violence in southern Iraq as British troops withdraw, and anticipated a weakening of political will in Washington and Baghdad to back the troops.
Three weeks after the launch of the new US strategy in Iraq, Pentagon officials were cautious Thursday saying early signs were good, but that it was too soon to make concrete conclusions.
I would say, just looking at the reports from the people on the ground ... I think their assessment would be, 'It's too early to draw any conclusions,' because this is still in the early stages, Pentagon number two Gordon England said.
But the deputy defense secretary acknowleged at a Senate committee hearing on the 2008 budget that there had been reports of fewer sectarian killings in the country.
Admiral Edmund Giambastiani, the deputy chief-of-staff, stressed that the US administration was not prepared to make definite conclusions on just a week or two of statistics to indicate an overall trend.
However, we do see sectarian killings are down right now. 
And that's substantial. 
And we hope that that trend continues. 
But it's not really a trend yet, he told the committee.
Giambastiani said he had talked to Lieutenant General David Petraeus the commander of US forces in Iraq on Wednesday and he relayed that the sectarian killings are down.
One other potential bright spot -- potential, I mention -- is that the sectarian migration from Baghdad, for example, and throughout the country, is also down.
The US Army announced on February 7 that the US-Iraq security plan unveiled in January by President George W. Bush was being fully implemented, although this has yet to be confirmed by the Iraqi government.
Under the plan, Bush, the commander-in-chief of US forces, is deploying some 21,500 extra US combat troops to Iraq to quell the violence in Baghdad and Anbar province.
Pakistani militants beheaded a man accused of spying for US forces in a tribal area bordering Afghanistan, officials said Tuesday.
The headless body of a man was found late Monday in a sack on a roadside in Jandola, a town bordering the troubled South Waziristan tribal region, a security official told AFP.
The severed head was placed near the sack and a note near his body read US spy and Rawalpindi, he said. 
Rawalpindi is a garrison city near the capital, Islamabad, where army headquarters are situated.
Local residents failed to identify the man -- who appeared to be in his mid-40s -- after which the body was buried, the security official said.
In the same area last month, militants decapitated an Afghan cleric accused of spying for US forces and making recordings of anti-Taliban speeches.
Militants have killed several pro-government tribal elders and other tribesmen in recent months.
Separately, two mortar shells fired by suspected militants exploded near a residential compound for military officers and their families in neighbouring North Waziristan's main town, Miranshah, another security official said.
There were no casualties in the attack early Tuesday, he added.
Pakistan signed peace deals with insurgents in South Waziristan in 2005 and North Waziristan in 2006, prompting concerns from NATO, US and Afghan officials. 
One of the conditions was an end to targeted killings by the militants.
An armed member of the Hamas-led auxiliary force was shot dead and two others wounded Tuesday night in clashes in the Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City, witnesses reported.
Joma'a Saqqa, chief of public relations at Shiffa Hospital, said that 26-year-old Alla al-Haddad was killed and two other members of the Hamas force were wounded. 
The two wounded men were in moderate and serious conditions.
Palestinian eyewitnesses said unidentified gunmen opened fire at a patrol belonging to the auxiliary force of the Hamas-led Interior Ministry.
Witnesses added that intensive armed clashes erupted between the force and one of the neighbourhood clans after news of the initial attack spread.
The death of the auxiliary force member came shortly before Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister designate Ismail Haniya held a meeting in Gaza to agree on forming a national unity government.
Haniya and Abbas are trying to implement an agreement that both Abbas's Fatah and the Islamist Hamas had reached in Mecca in Saudi Arabia on February 8, in which they agreed to end inter-fighting and form a coalition.
A member of the Hamas-controlled Executive Force was shot dead in Gaza City on Tuesday and four other Palestinians wounded when unknown gunmen opened fire on them, a medic and witnesses said.
The five, none of whose names were given, were was shot in the street in  the Zeitoun neighborhood, and their assailants then fled.
The shooting came as Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas's prime minister-designate, Ismail Haniya, were to meet in Gaza City on Tuesday night to continue discussions on forming a national unity government, and underscored the simmering tensions in the Palestinian territories.
On Sunday, a Palestinian militant was killed in a gunfight between rival factions in the Gaza Strip. 
That was the first deadly incident, apart from a feud between Gaza clans, since the two sides signed a ceasefire and power-sharing agreement in Saudi Arabia a month ago.
Six Russians, including three brothers, have been jailed for up to 11-1/2 years for the racially motivated killing of an Armenian, a Supreme Court spokesman said on Tuesday.
An appeal had slightly reduced some of their sentences.
Investigators found a notebook with drawings of swastikas and calls for violence against non-Slavs at the home of the brothers who together with their friends attacked the dark-skinned Armenian on a train in the Moscow region in 2005.
The Supreme Court has examined an appeal by the defence, Pavel Odintsov said.
A document detailing the Supreme Court's conclusions said the Russians had filmed their attack. 
The Kommersant daily reported on Tuesday the video had been posted on the Internet.
One of the Russians shouted: There's a black one, let's go rub him out! before the gang went on to kick and beat the Armenian over the head and body, also using glass bottles and a metal chain with a knot on the end, the document said.
Then one of the brothers followed a call by his friend to finish him off and killed the Armenian by stabbing him in the neck and stomach with a glass shard.
Attacks on dark-skinned foreigners in Russia have increased in recent years as part of a general rise in xenophobia after the collapse of communism.
President Vladimir Putin has described the trend as a threat to national security and urged courts and law enforcement agencies to step up their struggle against racism.
China wants to believe assurances from Japan and Australia that their new bilateral security cooperation framework is not targeted at the country, aForeign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.

Twenty five penguins have died from a mystery illness at an Australian marine theme park popular with tourists, authorities said on Wednesday.
The penguins fell ill last Thursday at Seaworld in tropical Queensland state and were all dead by the weekend, prompting government officials to launch an inquiry into the deaths.
Queensland primary industry officials said fears that the penguins may have died from an exotic disease or avian bird flu had been ruled out.
At this stage, it does not appear to be an infectious cause going on. 
So we don't believe there is a problem in terms of threat to other animals or the public, said Ron Glanville, Queensland department of primary industry chief veterinarian.
12 remaining sick penguins have been isolated so thattests can be carried out.

Anti-narcotics police in southern Afghanistan seized hundreds of kilograms of opium and heroin along with notebooks with guidelines for suicide bombers, the interior ministry said Wednesday.
The drugs were seized in the southern province of Helmand, Afghanistan's main drug trafficking and producing area, it said in a statement.
The haul included more than 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of opium and the same amount of ammonium chloride both raw ingredients for heroin.
There were also 18 kilograms of heroin and notebooks containing guidelines for suicide bombers.
Taliban insurgents have vowed to up step up suicide attacks this year after nearly 140 last year killed around 200 civilians and dozens of Afghan and foreign police and soldiers.
Six civilians were killed in a suicide attack on Wednesday in the eastern city of Khost. 
The attack came a day after three suicide blasts in the south killed four people and wounded about a dozen.
Experts say illicit drugs are funding the insurgency run mainly by Taliban loyalists.
Afghanistan produces 92 percent of the world's opium, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. 
Most of it is smuggled across the underpoliced borders with Pakistan and Iran from where it is believed to be taken to Europe.
The government and its allies have stepped up measures against the country's drugs trade, worth three billion dollars annually. 
The efforts includes eradication of poppy fields.
Protests were held across Egypt on Sunday against a set of constitutional amendments which critics say will strip Egyptians of civil liberties.
Authorities detained five activists after scuffles broke out in central Cairo when police tried to prevent a few dozen demonstrators from gathering in a downtown square, a security source told AFP.
Photographers had their cameras confiscated by security forces.
Opposition members have been eager to rally support for a boycott of the referendum being held on Monday over changes to 34 articles of the constitution, touted by the regime as a boost for democracy but which critics say will expand the power of the president.
About 300 people demonstrated outside the lawyers' syndicate in the north Sinai town of El-Arish, carrying banners and shouting slogans against the proposed amendments.
About 400 people gathered in Fayoum, south of Cairo, to protest against the changes, chanting down with the amendments, while 500 gathered in the Nile Delta governorate of Menufiya.
Dozens also protested outside the main courthouse in the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya carrying banners branding the amendments a violation of personal rights.
Large contingents of police were deployed around the protests.
The protest group Kefaya (Arabic for Enough) was also planning to hold demonstrations in the second city of Alexandria on Monday.
Parliament, which is dominated by the ruling National Democratic Party, overwhelmingly passed amendments to 34 articles of the constitution that they say will strengthen democracy and fight terrorism.
A united opposition front argues that the changes will only strengthen the regime's grip on power and has called on supporters to boycott the referendum.
Tamil Tiger rebels bombed Sri Lanka's main military airbase located next to the international airport Monday, leaving at least two airmen dead and 17 wounded, officials said.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) used their aircraft for the first time in a combat mission to bomb the Katunayake military base, Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan told AFP.
This mission was undertaken to reduce the air capability of the Sri Lankan airforce, Ilanthiriyan said. 
We will undertake similar missions to prevent the airforce bombing civilians.
Sri Lanka's military admitted that the Tigers had used their aircraft for the first time and bombed the airbase, where two people were killed and another 17 wounded. 
Two parked helicopters were also damaged.
One of the LTTE aircraft had flown over the airbase and dropped some explosive items, airforce spokesman Ajantha Silva said.
Adding that damage to the military facility was minor.
He said air defence systems were activated following the initial explosion.
Our air defence system was activated and a search operation is now under way, Silva told AFP.
He said the Bandaranaike international airport, which shares a boundary with the airbase, was not affected by the pre-dawn attack. 
However, the airport was shut as a precautionary measure.
Sri Lanka's foreign ministry spokesman Ravinatha Aryasinha said the airport was not affected by the bombing and it would soon reopen.
There is no damage to the international airport or the runway, Aryasinha said. 
Flights were suspended only as a precautionary measure. 
The airport will reopen soon.
At least four explosions were heard from the Katunayake airbase, local residents said.
Passengers aboard flights ready to take off from the international airport were asked to disembark as the airport was shut and supersonic military jets took off to search for enemy planes, officials said.
Roads leading to the airport were closed and people trying to catch flights out of the country were turned back by police, residents said. 
Telephone lines to the airport were also jammed.
Motorists and residents said they heard gunfire and several blasts near the international airport, about 35 kilometres (21 miles) north of here, sparking fears of a repeat of the July 2001 attack.
Tamil Tiger rebels entered the airbase on July 24, 2001 and destroyed more than a dozen military aircraft and then attacked six civilian aircraft parked at the civilian airport before detonating explosives strapped to their bodies.
About 20 people were killed in that attack but passengers at the international airport were not affected.
Sri Lanka's airport has remained on alert for a repeat of the 2001 attack, with severe restrictions on the number of people allowed into the terminal buildings.
Huge walls were also built around the terminals and the control towers to prevent impact from car bomb attacks, while a large number of sentries were placed along the approach roads to the facility.
An aftershock with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 jolted the west coast of central Japan on Monday morning, one day after a strong quake killed one person and injured nearly 200 in the same area, the Meteorological Agency said.
Sunday's 6.9 magnitude quake, which struck at 09:42 a.m. (00:42GMT), demolished houses, buckled roads, triggered landslides and cut off water supplies to thousands of homes.
About 2,600 people spent the night in shelters after 58 houses were destroyed and 455 -- many wooden structures with heavy tile roofs -- were seriously damaged by Sunday's tremor, officials and media said.
Many other residents had spent the night in their cars, as aftershocks continued to jolt the area, broadcaster NHK said.
The 5.3 aftershock struck at 7:16 a.m. on Monday (2216 GMT Sunday), and officials warned that more could be in store.
No tsunami warning was issued.
The focus of Sunday's quake -- which was also felt in Tokyo -- was 11 km (7 miles) below the seabed off the Noto peninsula in Ishikawa prefecture, about 300 km (190 miles) west of Tokyo.
Iranian president said Sunday evening that Iran will definitely continue its peaceful and legal nuclear activities regardless of a UN Security Council resolution issued Saturday in this regard.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the adoption of this resolution is a fresh act along other spiteful and vicious movements of certain powers since the victory of the great Islamic revolution.
Speaking at the first session of the cabinet in the new Iranian year, the president remarked that the recent illegal resolution is nothing new to the Iranian people.
He added that some powers who have made up certain mechanisms like the Security Council after the second World War, are trying to consolidate their dominance worldwide and are against the prosperity and independence of the Iranian nation.
He also said that the enemies have once again perpetrated a mistake about the great Iranian nation who are united and determined in pursuing their lofty aspirations.
Referring to the resolution, Ahmadinejad said such acts would only bring international bodies into disrepute and removes the nations trust in them.
The coordination of efforts between Moscow and Beijing on the world arena in order to solve topical regional issues, first of all the North Korean nuclear problem, will be discussed during the negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao here on Monday.
Among issues of the international agenda of the summit is the coordination of the efforts aimed at peaceful and steady development of the situation in the regions geographically close to our countries, primarily in order to attain positive results during the six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear problem and the fulfillment of the joint statement issued on September 19, 2005, a representative of the Russian presidential administration told Itar-Tass.
The settlement of the situation around Iran, cooperation within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and issues on the UN agenda will be discussed, he added. 
Russia and China are interested in the UN strengthening and raising its effectiveness as the major international mechanism of collective counteraction to many challenges in the modern world, the Kremlin representative pointed out.
The upcoming meeting between Putin and Hu Jintao will be the first for the leaders of the countries this year. 
They met six times in various formats in 2006.
A Palestinian woman was caught trying to smuggle three crocodiles from Egypt into the Gaza Strip via Rafah Border Crossing, it was revealed Sunday.
Maria Telleria, spokeswoman for EU BAM, which monitors the border as part of an agreement between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, said that the smuggler tried to cross Thursday into Gaza with the three crocodiles taped to her upper body.
A Palestinian guard noticed the woman was oddly obese and became suspicious. 
He notified the monitors, and the reptiles were discovered on further inspection.
The crocodiles measured 40 to 50 centimetres in length. 
They were returned to Egypt, and the woman was questioned by Palestinian security officials.
She related that she wanted to sell the reptiles to a local zoo.
Belarusian officials have offered Venezuela an arms package for anti-aircraft and high-tech weapons designed to defeat US military technologies, the Belapan news agency reported Monday.
The report came less than a week after Belarus' government announced it would supply Caracas a substantial number of night vision devices, described by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in number as enough for every rifle in the Venezuelan army.
The proposed sale calls for the delivery of an unspecified number of anti-aircraft missiles to Venezuela, claimed by Belarus to be capable of intercepting and destroying advanced aircraft.
The medium- and short-range missiles are modernised Soviet-era missile systems, and called by the Belarusian army Pechora-2T and Osa-1T, respectively. 
The size and value of the delivery was still under negotiation.
The Belarusian arms firm Teteraedr, manufacturer of the Pechora and Osa missiles, also will offer Venezuela the newly-developed TRK missile system, which is capable of intercepting not only high-tech aircraft, but smart munitions dropped by them, a company official said.
Belarusian arms manufacturers are keen to expand make Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez one of their top customers.
Chavez, an outspoken opponent of US foreign policy, has embarked on an international arms-buying spree, financed by income from Venezuelan oil exports.
The US last May banned arms sales to Venezuela, traditionally a buyer of American military equipment. 
Since then Chavez has looked to China and former Soviet republics for new weaponry.
Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko like Chavez is a target for US isolation efforts, in Lukashenko's case because of Belarus' authoritarian government.
Jordan's King Abdullah II and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Monday urged the upcoming Arab summit conference in Riyadh to adopt practical attitudes that help to push forward the Arab-Israeli peace process, a royal court statement said.
The two leaders met to appraise the outcome of the separate meetings they held earlier in the day in Amman with the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Abdullah and Abbas expressed hope that the Arab summit will adopt practical stances that will be instrumental in addressing all challenges facing the Arab nation at this difficult and critical juncture, including the Palestinian question, the statement said.
The meeting came in the course of continuous consultations between the two leaders ahead of the Arab summit due to be held on Wednesday in Riyadh, where the Arab peace initiative will figure prominently, it added.
Arab leaders want the Arab blueprint to serve as a catalyst for reinvigorating the peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
Against widely perceived sentiments in the Arab world that Washington will BE pressing for introducing changes to the peace plan, Rice said she was not asking for it to be amdnded, but indicated the Arab summit should develop a mechanism for its re-launching.
King Abdullah considered the closing of Palestinian ranks as the channel for realizing the aspirations of the Palestinian people and convincing the world that an efficient Palestinian peace partner does virtually exist, the statement said.
Israeli and Palestinian leaders have agreed to hold biweekly meetings that will begin to discuss steps that could lead to formation of a Palestinian state, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Tuesday.
She appealed to Arab states to reach out to the Jewish state.
Rice said talks between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert would focus on security issues but also begin to discuss the development of a political horizon consistent with the establishment of a Palestinian state in accordance with the 'road map'.
She said the United States would help Abbas and Olmert overcome obstacles and develop new ideas, although she offered no details.
Rice said she would meet periodically with Olmert and Abbas sometimes separately, sometimes together, in whatever form will be most effective to accelerate progress.
We are not yet at final status negotiations. 
These are initial discussions to build confidence between parties, Rice said.
Suicide is the top killer of young Chinese, accounting for more than a quarter of deaths in the 15 to 34-year-old age group last year, the official China Daily said on Tuesday.
The stress of living in a highly competitive and fast changing society is taking a rising toll on the country's young, many of them only children both pampered and pressured by parents and grandparents.
Statistics from the Chinese Association of Mental Health showed suicide was the leading killer of young people in 2006, causing 26 percent of deaths. 
The association did not give a total number of deaths.
In 2003, the last year for which figures are available, over a quarter of a million people committed suicide in China and another two million attempted suicide, the paper said.
In comparison the United States had 31,500 suicides in the same year -- a far lower rate, even taking into account the country's smaller population, the paper added.
Many of the deaths in China are among teenagers, with a survey of more than 140,000 high school students finding that around 20 percent said they had considered suicide and 6.5 percent said they had made concrete plans to kill themselves.
Since 2002 the proportion of teenagers considering each of the three steps towards suicide considering it, making a plan and taking action had all risen, the report by the Child and Teenage Health Research Institute at Peking University found.
Around half the children said they had felt lonely in theprevious year and 40 percent had recurrent sleeping problems.
The problems were due in part to a cultural unwillingness to discuss feelings, relationship difficulties and the lack of channels for exploring self-identity, researchers found.
Asked to picture their ideal world, they drew themselves without uniforms or regulated hairstyles, free from parents' and teachers' controls, the paper added.
More doubt has been cast over East Timor's presidential poll after a UN-appointed team said Saturday it could not verify the integrity of the nation's electoral process, two days ahead of the vote.
The team, set up in East Timor by the United Nations last year, could not certify the process against tests to ensure the vote is free and transparent, said Vincent da Cruz, its special assistant.
Yes, that is correct, da Cruz told AFP, when asked if the poll had yet to be certified.
Half the eight candidates standing for election said Friday they feared many attempts had been made to manipulate the election process and that there had been violence, intimidation and threats.
Monday's presidential election will be East Timor's first since independence in 2002, following a bloody separation from Indonesia.
At least 32 people have been injured in election-linked unrest that led Police to fire warning shots, the UN said.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday called on all parties to make the election free and fair.
I hope the elections will be free, fair, transparent and credible. 
I hope they will be unmarred by violence and intimidation, and I hope they will lead to results accepted by all, Ban said in a message broadcast on local radio.
Violence has pulsed through East Timor, one of the world's newest and poorest countries, since it chose self-determination in a UN-administered referendum in 1999.
At least 37 people were killed and 150,000 displaced in unrest last year that led to the dispatch of Australian-led international peacekeepers.
Iran has arrested a man on suspicion of leaking secrets of the country's disputed nuclear activities to an exiled Iranian opposition group, state radio said on Tuesday.
The man had handed over classified information, including a bulletin on nuclear activities, to the hypocrites (People's Mujahideen) state radio said, without giving a source.
The People's Mujahideen, labelled a terrorist group in the European Union and the United States, was the first body to expose Iran's covert nuclear programme in 2002.
A leading hardline MP confirmed the arrest.
The man has been working in parliament's research centre since 2001, Ahmad Tavakoli told the semi-official Fars news agency.
He was gathering and giving information to the terrorist group, he said, adding that the man would be put on trial soon.
Judiciary officials were not immediately available for comment.
Iranian analysts say the People's Mujahideen lacks support in Iran where few can forgive its siding with Saddam Hussein in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously on Dec. 23 to impose sanctions on Iran's trade in sensitive nuclear materials and technology in an attempt to stop uranium enrichment work that could produce material that could be used in bombs.
Tehran says it is determined to continue its nuclear work, which it says is meant only for producing electricity.
The West suspects Iran's atomic work is part of a veiled nuclear arms programme.
Jordanian security forces killed a suspected member of the al-Qaeda terrorist network and captured another Tuesday in a shootout in the northern city of Irbid, 80 kilometres north of the capital Amman, a government spokesman said.
A group belonging to the General Intelligence Department (GID), backed by a force from the Public Security Directorate (PSD), killed an al-Qaeda member and arrested another during a shootout at a house in Irbid, an authoritative security source was quoted as saying by the official Petra news agency.
The official identified the slain al-Qaeda member as Suleiman al-Anjadi and the captured member as Ramadan al-Mansi. 
Both men carried Jordanian passports.
A number of security men were lightly wounded in the operation, the unidentified official said.
The joint GID and PSD force stormed the house after receiving information about plans by al-Qaeda to carry out attacks inside Jordan, he added.
Over the past few years, Jordan has been the scene of several acts of terrorism and terrorist attempts.
In November 2005, three Iraqi suicide bombers blew themselves up at three Amman hotels, killing 60 people and wounding more than 90.
Responsibility for the bombings was claimed by al-Qaeda branch in Iraq led by the Jordanian fugitive Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in June 2006 in a US airstrike inside Iraq.
Pakistan and India will review the progress made during the third round of their composite dialogue and discuss bilateral relations and the future course of the peace process during the forthcoming visit of Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee. 
Foreign Office spokesperson Tasneem Aslam told a media briefing here yesterday that Pranab Mukherjee during his visit to Islamabad this week would extend a formal invitation to the Pakistani leadership for the 14th SAARC summit, scheduled to be held in New Delhi in April. 
Mukherjee will also hold talks with Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri to discuss the progress made so far in the composite dialogue launch in January 2004, besides planning for the forth round of talks, she said. 
The two countries are likely to sign several agreements including one on visa relaxation to facilitate people-to-people contacts. 
About the proposed visit of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Pakistan, the spokesperson said the date had not yet been finalized. 
Ms Aslam, when asked who will represent Pakistan at the SAARC Summit, said no decision had been made as yet.
To a question whether India had shown some flexibility over the Kashmir dispute, the spokesperson said the Indian prime minister in his recent statements had welcomed various ideas floated by President Pervez Musharraf for movement towards a resolution of the core issue.
More than 120,000 obese Americans had some kind of surgery to help them lose weight in 2004, with the biggest increase among middle-aged people, according to a study released on Wednesday.
In 1998, 772 people aged 55 to 64 had gastric bypass, stapling or some similar procedure known as bariatric surgery to help weight loss. 
But that number ballooned to 15,086 in 2004, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
Among the reasons for the extremely dramatic increases is that the mortality outcomes from obesity surgery have improved greatly, the agency said in a statement. 
The national death rate for patients hospitalized for bariatric surgery declined 78 percent, from 0.9 percent in 1998 to 0.2 percent in 2004.
Agency director Dr. Carolyn Clancy said the report shows more Americans are turning to obesity surgery and that an increasing number of younger people are undergoing these procedures.
More than 103,000 of the 2004 operations were on patients aged 18 to 54, the study found, and 349 were performed on youngsters aged 12 to 17.
As the rate of obesity continues to climb, the health care system needs to be prepared for continued escalation in the rate of this surgery and its potential complications, she said.
The average hospital cost for an obesity surgery patient stay, excluding physician fees, was $10,395 in 2004 as compared with $10,970 in 1998, adjusted for inflation, according to the report, published online.
Insurgents killed three US soldiers in war-torn Iraq, raising the military's losses to 47 since the start of January, the military reported Monday.
A soldier was killed when a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle in northern Nineveh province Monday, a US military statement said.
An earlier statement said two marines had died on Sunday from wounds sustained in enemy action while operating in the western Anbar province.
Saturday was one of the deadliest days since the March 2003 invasion, with 25 US service members killed across the war-torn country.
The latest fatalities brought US losses since the invasion to 3,053, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
Interpol opened Tuesday a three-day Asian Regional Conference in Tokyo, the sixth of its kind and the first to be hosted by Japan.
The conference, organized by Japan's National Police Agency and the International Criminal Police Organization's General Secretariat, have 35 regional coordinators and liaison officers from 22 countries and regions in Asia, including China, South Korea, India and Thailand, which are all part of the 186-member organization.
During the conference, the participants will discuss increasing cases of cross-border crimes, including escapes by native or foreign suspects into other countries, and the use of fake credit cards.
The NPA said a total of 819 crime suspects left Japan at the end of 2005. 
By nationalities, Chinese topped the list at 281, followed by Japanese at 168, and Brazilian at 86.
Last Thursday, a Japanese-Brazilian who fled to Brazil after allegedly causing a fatal hit-and-run accident in Shizuoka Prefecture was indicted by Brazilian prosecutors at the request of the Japanese government.
Headquartered in the French city of Lyon, Interpol is the world's largest international police organization. Created in 1923, it facilitates cross-border police cooperation and offers support for all organizations, authorities and services for combating international crimes.   
Hundreds of protesters blocked off several roads in and around Lebanon's capital Beirut on Tuesday at the start of a general strike called by the opposition, witnesses said.
They said protesters burned tyres and placed rocks and other barricades in several streets in central Beirut, its mainly Shi'ite southern suburb and the southern entrances of the capital.
As Japan and China step up ties with a likely address by Chinese Premier Wen to Japanese legislators, civil exchanges will also grow as visa application processes improve, state press said Tuesday.
China and Japan have agreed to exchange visits of more than 20,000 people to mark the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties this year, the China Daily reported.
Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic Party official Toshihiro Nikai, an envoy of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and the director of the China National Tourism Administration, Shao Qiwei, reached the agreement, it said.
The government-sponsored visits will be separate from tourist and business travel that are already booming, it said.
In an effort to ease visa application requirements, Japan will also increase from four to six the number of Chinese cities where visas to Japan can be obtained, it said.
During talks Monday with State Councillor Tang Jiaxuan, Nikai also discussed the possibility of Wen addressing the Japanese parliament when he visits Japan in the coming months, the paper said.
Peng Zhen, the former head of China's parliament, was the last Chinese leader to address Japan's parliament in 1985.
According to the Nikkei newspaper in Tokyo, Japan and China are also planning to increase military exchanges with reciprocal port visits by naval vessels.
Relations between Japan and China were badly strained under former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi who repeatedly visited a controversial shrine to Japanese war dead.
But ties improved after Abe succeeded Koizumi last year. 
He visited Beijing in October, his first overseas visit after taking over as prime minister.
Still the two nations are entangled in a wide range of disputes, including those related to Japan's military occupation of China that ended in 1945, rival claims to rich gas reserves and other territorial disputes.
Just a modest amount of mental stimulation can go a long way toward warding off Alzheimer's disease, according to researchers who created mice genetically modified to get a condition similar to it. 
Researchers at the University of California-Irvine studied hundreds of mice altered to make them develop abnormalities known as plaques and tangles in brain tissue that are considered hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease in people. 
Writing on Tuesday in the Journal of Neuroscience, they said periodic learning sessions swimming in a tub of water until finding a submerged platform to stand on slowed the development in the mice of those two abnormalities. 
The remarkable thing was that just by learning infrequently, they still had a very dramatic effect on the Alzheimer's disease pathology, said Kim Green, one of the researchers. 
So it suggests that in humans, if you learn more and more and more, it's going to have a huge, beneficial effect, Green added. 
The findings highlight an idea that also has emerged in other research -- that exercising one's mind is important to staving off Alzheimer's disease, the degenerative brain malady that is the most common form of dementia among the elderly. 
Green noted that other studies have found that more highly educated people are less likely to develop Alzheimer's than people with less education. 
There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, which gradually destroys a person's memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgments, communicate and carry out daily activities. 
What we have shown is that by learning, by stimulating your mind, you're able to protect against the development of the pathologies associated with the disease, Green said. 
Crossword puzzles, reading books, learning a new language -- anything you can do to stimulate the brain is going to be beneficial, we think, Green added. 
Green said the mice were given a very mild learning experience essentially figuring out a maze but in the water for a week at a time every three months. 
The sessions were four times daily for a week at 2, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months of age. 
The mice that performed the task experienced slower development of the protein beta amyloid clumping in the brain and forming plaques, gooey buildup that accumulates outside nerve cells, the study found. 
Guinea's embattled leaders resumed crisis talks with the labour movement, in the absence of ailing President Lansana Conte, a day after a bloody repression of anti-Conte protests. 
Conte had been expected at scheduled emergency talks with labour leaders behind a crippling strike aimed at removing him from office, but a union official said the president instead sent his wife Henriette to ask the unions to return to negotiations. 
We were to have seen the presidential couple, but it is just the first lady who received us. 
We don't know why, said Ousmane Souare, of the Syndicated Union of Workers of Guinea (USGT), one of the two labour confederations behind the protests. 
The talks, which other union officials earlier announced were underway with the ailing president, came after thousands of people rallied against Conte in peaceful marches throughout the country a day after 34 protesters were shot dead by security forces. 
A strike called by the unions has paralysed the world's top bauxite exporter since January 10. 
Security forces in Conakry were on high alert Tuesday to prevent protesters from volatile suburbs reaching the heart of the capital, after Monday's crackdown by riot police and soldiers on protestors armed with no more than stones. 
Which took the death toll in two weeks to 44. 
Authorities threw a tight security cordon around the presidential palace and a military base where 72-year-old Conte, who first came to power in a bloodless 1984 coup, was in residence. 
A medical official at Conakry's main hospital of Donka, said four people died during the day Tuesday from gunshot wounds received Monday. 
The strike protest, backed by 14 opposition parties, began over endemic corruption and interference in the judiciary by Conte after he freed two associates facing trial for embezzlement. 
After meeting Conte near the outset of the protest, strike leaders demanded that the head of state be constitutionally removed by the Supreme Court on the grounds that he is too unwell to continue in office. 
Conte suffers from chronic diabetes. 
Conte, who is rarely seen in public and was twice hospitalised in Switzerland last year, has so far dismissed the demands and called on the military to back his government. 
On Tuesday the international community again condemned the violence in this west African country of 10 million people. 
African Union commission chief Alpha Oumar Konare condemns the repression of demonstrations that led to the deaths of several people.
Konare urged all parties to hold talks and to thoroughly investigate the violence that has marked two weeks of political confrontation. 
Former colonial ruler France condemned the use of violence, expressing deep concern at the rising numbers of victims.
A continental rights group based in Dakar, the African Assembly for the Defence of Human Rights (Raddho), appealed for an urgent international intervention to prevent a massacre in Guinea. 
The United Nations special envoy to west Africa, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, on Tuesday left Dakar for Conakry to see the situation on the ground, a UN source said. 
Union leaders behind the strike were on Monday briefly detained by troops allegedly led by Conte's son Captain Ousmane. 
He has denied any involvement in the arrests. 
Authorities at Donka Hospital, one of the country's largest, said most of the victims of the deadly attacks were from the capital Conakry. 
On Tuesday people were sifting through bodies in blood-soaked clothes in search of missing relatives at a city mortuary. 
Iraq is planning to invite foreign ministers from neighbouring countries to a meeting in Baghdad as part of efforts to improve relations with them, the Iraqi foreign minister said on Tuesday. 
It will be a turning point in how our neigbours view Iraq, Hoshiyar Zebari told reporters after a meeting with his Italian counterpart Massimo D'Alema in Rome. 
He gave no other details on the proposed meeting, except to say he hoped that everyone invited would show up. 
Fears that an Iraqi civil war would draw in neighbours on opposing sides, notably Iran behind its fellow Shi'ites and the Arab states behind Iraq's Sunni minority have increased pressure on the neighbouring countries to support a political solution in Iraq. 
Trying to persuade a sceptical Congress to support sending more troops to Iraq, US President George W Bush warned Tuesday that if the United States fails, sectarian violence could spill over into an epic battle between Sunnis and Shiites in a wider regional conflict.
Bush has begun deploying the first of 21,500 more troops to Iraq as part of his revised strategy announced two weeks ago, but the Democratic controlled Congress and some members of Bush's Republican Party steadfastly oppose the plan.
If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides, Bush said.
We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al-Qaeda and supporters of the old regime.
A contagion of violence could spill out across the country and in time the entire region could be drawn into the conflict, he added in the State of the Union address. 
For America, this is a nightmare scenario.
Bush's speech before a joint session of Congress comes amidst thelowest job approval ratings of his president, mainly because of the unpopular war in Iraq. 
Bush said there was still time to reverse the violent trend in Iraq and prevail, but noted it requires the perseverance of the American people.
This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight weare in, Bush said. 
Every one of us wishes this war were over and won.
Let us find our resolve, and turn events toward victory, he said.
Democrats, who won control of Congress in November 7 electionsby campaigning on changing course in Iraq, want Bush to instead begin withdrawals of US troops and quickly rebuked expanding the US presence.
The president took us into this war recklessly, said Senator Jim Webb, who delivered the Democratic response to Bush's speech. 
We are now, as a nation, held hostage to the predictable and predicted disarray that has followed.
Confronting the sharp criticism his plan has faced, Bush said that after a review of his policy that the best solution was to send more troops into Iraq to improve security in Baghdad and go after Sunni insurgents and terrorists operating in al-Anbar province.
I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance of success, Bush said. 
Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq - because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far reaching.
Bush urged Democrats and Republicans to work together and reminded members of both parties who are now critical of his policy in Iraq that some of them voted to authorize the use of force before the March 2003 invasion.
We went into this largely united in our assumptions, and in our convictions, Bush said. 
And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. 
Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq and I ask you to give it a chance to work.
Bush announced his plan on January 10. 
Touching on it again Tuesday, he said US support for the Iraqi government was not open ended and urged the Iraqis to take more steps to reduce sectarian bloodshed.
Bush has also warned Iran for supporting Shiite attacks againstSunnis and said during the speech that Shiite extremists backed by Iran were on the rise as terrorist threat and were as equally determined as their Sunni counterparts to create a Middle Eastgoverned by repressive regimes. 
The Shi'a and Sunni extremists are different faces of the sametotalitarian threat, Bush said in his annual State of the Union speech before the joint session of Congress. 
But whatever slogans they chant when they slaughter the innocent, they have the same wicked purposes.
During the war on terrorism, most of the focus has been on the Sunni oriented al-Qaeda network that carried out the September 11,2001, terrorist attacks, but Hezbollah's stronghold on Lebanon has prompted greater concerns about Shiite terrorism. 
In recent times, it has also become clear that we face anescalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East, Bush said.
Bush also blamed Iran, regarded by the US government as theworld's biggest state sponsor of terrorism, for backing Lebanon-based Hezbollah. 
Bush said Hezbollah was second only to al-Qaeda in the American lives it has taken.
Bush said the war on terrorism is a generational struggle and in a sign of determination to work with the newly empowered Democrats in Congress, the president proposed establishing a bipartisan advisory council to help deveop strategies for defeating terrorism.
We will show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory, Bush said.
The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world, Bush said, referring to the September 11 attacks. 
And so long as that is the case, America is still a Nation at war.
Explosions in a Colombian coal mine killed at least 18 workers in the northeastern province of Norte de Santander on Saturday, and another 13 were trapped underground and feared dead, an official said on Sunday.
There were 31 men in the mine at the time of the explosions, Fernando Rosales, head of the province's civil defense corps, told Reuters.
Rescue and recovery attempts, complicated by deadly gases remaining in the mine shafts, resumed at daybreak on Sunday after being suspended the night before. 
The bodies of 18 miners were recovered from the La Peciosa mine near the town of Sardinata while 13 of their co-workers were unaccounted for.
It is impossible that those still in the mine are alive due to the high amount of poisonous gas in the mine shafts. 
It would be a miracle if they are alive, Carlos Garcia, head firefighter leading the rescue attempt, told Reuters.
Rescue workers face the danger of more explosions due to combustible gasses, local officials said.
La Preciosa produces coal for domestic consumption.
A similar accident occurred in the town of El Zulia, also in the mountainous province of Norte de Santander, when a coal mine explosion killed 15 people in 2001.
Norte de Santander is an area contested by left-wing rebels and far-right paramilitary militias fighting a decades-old guerrilla war. 
Both groups, branded terrorists by Washington, fight over control of cocaine smuggling routes from the province into neighboring Venezuela.
Yemen has granted political asylum to head of Somalia's Union of Islamic Courts, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, who is expected to leave Kenya for Yemen on Monday, Yemeni officials said Sunday.
The Yemeni government has granted Sheikh Sharif refugee status and residence permit, a senior Yemeni government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.
He said Yemen regards Sharif as a moderate among the leaders of the Somali Islamic movement.
Yemeni officials believe that Sharif, whose movement controlled the Somali capital Mogadishu and most of central and southern parts of the Horn of Africa country for six months last year, could play a key role in reconciliation in the anarchic country torn apart by clan rivalries.
He is a moderate person and could help avert the resurgence of violence in Somalia, the Yemeni official said.
Sharif gave himself up to Kenyan authorities on the border with Somalia last month after his movement lost its grip on Mogadishu to Ethiopian-backed government troops in December.
Since the defeat of the Islamic Courts' forces, Yemen has granted refuge to several Somali Islamic leaders.
Somali Interim President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed agreed last week to hold a reconciliation conference aimed at restoring political stability to his country.
If successful, the reconciliation process might draw the once-powerful Islamists into a power-sharing government.
Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi recently said he would speak with Sheikh Sharif.
A strong earthquake struck the eastern Caribbean on Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.
The 6.1 magnitude earthquake occurred 74 miles (119 km) north-northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, and 98 miles (157 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Cuba, the U.S. agency said.
The quake was felt in Jamaica and in Cuba, on the southern coast of the eastern provinces of Granma and Santiago, but there were no reports of damage or injuries.
The attack was the first of its kind in Nepal where the monarch was traditionally regarded as an incarnation of Hindu god Vishnu but has become unpopular since King Gyanendra took power only to be forced down by weeks of violent protests last year.
The 59-year-old monarch was on his way to the Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu to pray on the occasion of Mahashivratri when crowds hurled stones at his motorcade as it neared the venue, they said.
The stones hit one car accompanying King Gyanendra's vehicle before the heavily-guarded convoy made it to the temple where the monarch worshipped on the annual grand night festival of Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.
The crowd also shouted Gyanendra thief, leave the country as a power shutdown plunged the area into darkness, Ishwar Dhakal, a witness said.
Police said the crowd was baton-charged before the king was driven back to the palace safely.
King Gyanendra has been isolated since he gave in to mass protests last year, stripped of most of his powers including the control of the powerful army and is rarely seen in public.
Gyanendra was a businessman before he became king in 2001 after his brother, King Birendra, and eight other royals were shot dead in a drug-and-drink fuelled shooting spree by the then crown prince who later turned the gun on himself.
Friday's attack came despite authorities deploying thousands of policemen at the pilgrimage site over fears that religious groups could use the festival to demand the country revert to being a Hindu state.
The Himalayan nation was the world's only Hindu state until it was declared a secular country last year after King Gyanendra stepped down from power.
Organisers of the festival said about 300,000 pilgrims from Nepal and neighbouring India were expected at the temple of Lord Shiva, one of the trinity of Hindu gods.
One man died and 18 people were injured when the front of a double-decker passenger bus was ripped open in a collision with a truck in Hong Kong Saturday morning.
At least two passengers were thrown from the bus onto the road in the accident but it was unclear whether the dead man was travelling in the bus or in the truck it collided with.
The accident happened near a toll plaza at the entrance to the Tai Lam road tunnel in Hong Kong shortly after 9 am (0100 GMT), police said. 
Two lanes of traffic were closed by the accident.
Hong Kong saw its worst road accident in July 2003 when a truck shunted a double-decker bus over the edge of a 30-metre highway bridge, killing 21 people on board.
The 53-year-old truck driver involved in the accident was later convicted of dangerous driving causing death and served seven months in jail.
Burundi will send some 1,700 troops to Somalia as part of an African Union peacekeeping mission to stabilise the chaotic Horn of Africa nation, the army said on Sunday, adding that an advance team would leave in days.
Somalia's interim government, whose forces ousted Islamists from Mogadishu and much of the south in December with help from Ethiopian troops, has called for the 8,000-strong AU force to be deployed as soon as possible.
Uganda is to send a 1,500-strong force in the next few days to Mogadishu, where frequent attacks underline the challenge facing the government in trying to tame a nation where anarchy has prevailed since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre's 1991 ouster.
Burundi will supply 1,700 troops and the first elements are expected to leave next week, said army spokesman Colonel Adolphe Manirakiza, adding that 80 extra army officers would also be sent.
It is a response to the African Union request which asked African countries to supply troops to help Somalia find peace.
A 5,600-strong U.N. force was deployed in June 2004 in Burundi, which is emerging from more than a decade of civil war that killed 300,000 people.
Several hundred of the troops remain in the country, now operating under an AU mission to monitor a ceasefire agreement between the government and Burundi's last rebel group.
The tiny central African nation has sent about 50 army and police officers to Sudan's troubled Darfur region and a police spokesman said this week 20 police officers were ready to go to Ivory Coast as part of the U.N. mission there.
The AU mission in Somalia will take over from Ethiopian forces, who have come under attack in Mogadishu.
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice meets Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Monday, but has sought to lower expectations about the talks' outcome.
Rice said the meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would amount to informal discussions rather than negotiations.
Rice spent Sunday shuttling between the Israelis and the Palestinians, trying to agree an agenda for the talks which have been overshadowed by a deal to form a Palestinian government comprising Abbas's Fatah party and the militant movement Hamas.
The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog is to visit North Korean from March 13 to 15 to discuss the shutdown of its nuclear arms programme, Japan's Kyodo news reported on Wednesday, citing a diplomatic source in Seoul.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei said last week he had received an invitation from Pyongyang after the North struck a deal this month to shut its nuclear site and allow U.N. inspectors into the country in return for aid.
A firm date has yet to be formally announced for his visit.
The visit is expected to happen the week after the board of governors, said a spokesman for the IAEA. 
The board starts its meeting on March 5.
A Ryanair jet made a non-scheduled landing in the German city of Cologne during the night after a Polish passenger pretended to have a bomb in his carry-on luggage, German police said Wednesday.
The plane was flying from Luebeck, northern Germany, to Stansted near London. 
The passenger, 22, had refused to switch off his cellphone when asked to do so by the man seated next to him, and then claimed he had a bomb.
The Irish plane was over Dutch territory at this time. 
Its pilot issued an emergency radio call and diverted to Cologne, Germany.
Police arrested the passenger when the plane touched down shortly before midnight, but found no bomb in his luggage. 
He was slightly drunk and insisted he had been joking. 
Police freed him on bail on the condition that he immediately return to Poland.
A Lebanese national on Wednesday became the latest foreign worker to be kidnapped in southern Nigeria, a police source said.
Felix Ogbaudu, police commissioner for the southern Rivers State, said gunmen seized the man, who worked for a construction firm in Mbiama, some 30 kilometres (20 miles) outside Port Harcourt, the state capital.
He said he had no further details.
The latest kidnapping brings to 58 the number of foreigners who have been seized by armed groups in southern Nigeria since the start of the year, almost as many as in the whole of 2006.
On Friday one Lebanese man was shot dead and another wounded after gunmen opened fire on them in Rivers State.
Influential Republican Senator John McCain announced Wednesday he will run for the White House in the 2008 race.
I am announcing that I will be a candidate for president of the United States, McCain, said on CBS television's Late Show with David Letterman.
The Arizona senator, who lost his party's nomination in 2000 to now-President George W. Bush, said he would make a formal announcement in April.
But his long-expected entry into the race sees him running well behind former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, his main competition for the Republican nomination, according to polls.
Regarded as a straight-shooter and something of a Republican maverick, McCain, 70, set Washington abuzz with a speech just following Congressional elections last November, which saw Republicans perform badly on voter unhappiness with the war in Iraq.
Without additional forces, we cannot win this war, said McCain, taking a strikingly unpopular position in the election's wake.
Also in November McCain, who was a prisoner of war in the Vietnam conflict, used a congressional hearing to dress down General John Abizaid, the top US commander in the Middle East.
I regret deeply that you seem to think the status quo and the rate of progress we're making is acceptable. 
I think most Americans do not, McCain said.
As Democrats demand a phased withdrawal of US troops, McCain has argued that more men must be poured in to flush out insurgent strongholds, crush militias and sectarian violence and to train Iraqi forces -- a position since taken up by Bush.
McCain's many maverick stands also include challenges to his own party over corporate financing and to the White House over torture.
But a new poll Wednesday showed him lagging in the Republican race behind  Giuliani, known as America's Mayor for his handling of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on New York. 
Giuliani was pulling in 44 percent of support, compared to 34 percent on January 19, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll.
McCain, his top rival, lost six points, going from 27 percent last month to 21 percent in the new poll.
Former legislator Newt Gingrich, who led the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in 1994, gained six points, getting 15 percent of support compared to nine percent a month ago.
On the Democratic side, meanwhile, Senator Hillary Clinton lost some ground the same survey showed.
But also showing strength was former vice president Al Gore, who got a boost following his winning an Academy Award Sunday for his documentary on climate change An Inconvenient Truth.
Clinton, the former first lady, was favored by 36 percent of Democrats compared to 41 percent in an earlier survey. 
Her main rival in the 2008 Democratic race, Senator Barack Obama, enjoyed a surge in support with 24 percent in the latest poll compared to 17 percent in a January 19 survey.
The poll numbers of another Democratic frontrunner, 2004 vice presidential candidate John Edwards, remained stable at 12 percent, just one point higher than a month ago.
Suspected militants slew a teacher for a madrassa Islamic religious school in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province after accusing him of working for US security agencies, the Dawn newspaper reported Thursday.
The teacher's body and severed head were found Tuesday by a roadside near Jandola in the tribal district of Tank, located about 250 kilometres south-west of the provincial capital, Peshawar.
Dawn said the body was stuffed into a sack while the head lay in the open and an attached Urdu-language note identified the victim as an Afghan teacher of a madrassa in Pakistan's restive North Waziristan region.
The killers also wrote hypocrite on the forehead of the man, whose death was a result of spying for Americans, the note said.
Militants in Pakistan's tribal areas have beheaded a number of people in recent months for allegedly providing intelligence to US forces fighting Taliban insurgents in neighbouring Afghanistan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday formally endorsed Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov to become the local president of the war-torn southern Russian republic.
I took this decision because you have done a lot to restore Chechnya in the last few years, Putin was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying at a meeting in his residence in suburban Novo-Orgaryovo.
Kadyrov, who is currently interim president of the province, promised to boost security and said he would turn Chechnya into a blossoming region. 
The people of Chechnya want to be part of Russia, he added.
His candidature will now go before the local Chechen parliament which is widely expected to approve it. 
The reports said the parliament will meet on Friday to vote on Kadyrov's appointment.
The 30-year-old strongman is the unofficial leader of a powerful militia force that has been accused of numerous human rights abuses, including kidnappings and torture, by local and international non-governmental groups.
Kadyrov has, however, become popular in Chechnya for overseeing an ambitious reconstruction programme that has brought a measure of normality to parts of the war-ravaged territory.
He is the son of Akhmad Kadyrov, a former separatist who defected to Moscow's side and rose to become president of Chechnya before being assassinated in a 2004 attack in Grozny.
Moscow has fought two full-blown wars in Chechnya a 1994-96 conflict in which Russian forces suffered a humiliating defeat and a second assault that began in 1999 and continues today in the form of low-level skirmishes.
Danish police arrested at least 100 people in Copenhagen on Thursday in violent street clashes after authorities evicted left-wing squatters from a youth centre, a police spokesman said.
Authorities took control of the building in the central Norrebro area in a morning raid that saw officers land on the roof in helicopters.
In the wake of the eviction, scores of demonstrators threw cobblestones at police and set makeshift barricades on fire. 
Officers in riot gear chased protesters through the streets as police vans smashed through the barricades.
Clashes flared up again in the late afternoon after a call on the youth centre's Web site for a demonstration through Norrebro towards the house.
During the evening march, protesters threw bottles and bricks at the police and witnesses said they heard bangs and saw some throwing what may have been smoke bombs or fireworks.
We estimate there are around 1,300 people in the procession ... As far as we know no one has been seriously injured so far, Copenhagen police spokesman Flemming Steen Munch said.
The conflict over the youth centre has been simmering since 2000 when local government sold the building to a religious group. 
Left-wing activist have used it as a base since 1982.
The current owners have a court order to have squatters evicted but the youths have sworn to protect the house and have repeatedly called for a political solution.
Police and demonstrators clashed several times last year during protests over the eviction order.
A German arrested in Pakistan on suspicion of planning to attend a militant Islamist training camp has been released, the German foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
The ministry declined to say whether Michael N. had returned to Germany.
According to the German press, the 30-year-old convert to Islam was arrested in the Pakistani city of Raiwind near the border with India on February 2.
The German magazine Der Spiegel reported that he had planned to attend a training camp with a German of Bosnian citizenship, Nihad C., who was arrested in Pakistan on January 30.
The director of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Lebanon, Raouf Youssef, said Tuesday the aid granted from the US to Lebanon's army is given without any political conditions.
The aid is granted without any conditions and is aimed atbolstering the Lebanese army and security forces capabilities,said Youssef, responding to criticism and allegations by the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah.
Hezbollah said the US arms aid was aimed at arming the anti-Syrian factions loyal to the Western-backed government headed by Fouad Seniora.
Youssef added that the secrecy that surrounded the arms shipment to Lebanon was done upon the request of the Lebanese army.
According to Youssef, the United States dedicated nearly 1 billion dollars in aid for Lebanon to improve the capabilities of the Lebanese army to defend its borders.
The aid included training to bolster the Internal Security forces' technical abilities, Youssef said, adding that the training would focus on enabling the forces to protect crime scenes because this is something the security is lacking.
He said the security forces had never had training or experience in this field or in defending borders due to the nearly 30-year Syrian military presence in the country, which ended on April 26, 2005 following the assassination for former premier Rafik Hariri.
Syria was widely blamed for Hariri's assassination. 
Damascus has repeatedly denied such charges.
Youssef stressed that the Lebanese security forces still have a long way to go because stability has not yet been imposed in Lebanon because of the ongoing political crisis.
Lebanon has been hit by a series of deadly explosions following the assassination of Hariri on February 14, 2005.
Flash floods triggered by heavy snowfall have killed at least 12 people in Indian Kashmir, including several buried in their homes, police said on Wednesday.
Power was cut off in several areas and phones were not working.
Authorities have closed schools for a week as many roads, including the main highway that links the disputed Kashmir Valley to the rest of India, were blocked by snow and landslides.
Srinagar, the main city in the region, witnessed its heaviest snowfall in a decade for the month of March, a weather official said.
Separately, five Hindu pilgrims, including two children, froze to death on Monday while on their way to Vaishno Devi, one of Hinduism's holiest shrines in Jammu and Kashmir.
They died due to exposure after the road they were travelling on was blocked by a landslide.
In 2005, more than 225 people were killed in Kashmir after the heaviest snowfall in nearly two decades triggered avalanches.
Sri Lanka warplanes bombed suspected Tiger rebel camps on Wednesday, a day after top defence officials warned that the latest military campaign could last three years.
The military said supersonic jets staged sorties for the third day against suspected rebel positions in Thoppigala Jungle in the island's east.
There are no immediate reports of casualties, but Tuesday's air strikes damaged Tiger vehicles and infrastructure, military spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe told reporters.
He said the death toll in Monday's aerial attack had risen to ten, which included an eastern Tiger intelligence leader identified as Irakkian and a training instructor, adding that more than a dozen guerrillas were injured.
Sri Lankan troops backed by supersonic aircraft have stepped up their offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels in the island's restive northeast since April and have vowed to flush them out.
Within the next two to three years we should be able to eliminate them (Tamil Tigers), said a top defence source, who declined to be named.
He said the government would pursue a political solution alongside its military offensive as Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapakse was keen to bring about an honourable peace to end decades of bloodshed.
The source said the security forces were on a strong footing to win the military campaign, but that a political solution must be pursued in tandem.
Security forces last week launched a fresh offensive to drive deeper into a Tiger stronghold known as the Thoppigala jungle, which stretches from Batticaloa district to neighbouring Ampara district in the island's northeast.
Samarasinghe said eight police commandos and two soldiers have died in the latest military drive, which also injured 32 troops. 
He put the rebel toll at 40 killed.
Charities operating in the region on Monday raised concerns for the safety of civilians in the troubled Batticaloa district where over 120,000 people have been displaced.
However, Samarasinghe put the refugee toll at 87,711 since July 2006.
There was no comment from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has been fighting for an independent homeland for the minority Tamils in a 35-year conflict that has claimed over 60,000 lives.
According to latest military intelligence radical Iraqi Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr is still in Iran, the spokesman for US forces in Iraq told reporters on Wednesday.
Twenty-four hours ago he was not in Iraq. 
All indications are that he's still in Iran, Major General William Caldwell told reporters in Baghdad.
Sadr's supporters deny American claims, supported by some Iraqi officials, that the firebrand cleric fled the country in January ahead of a joint US-Iraqi security sweep that has targeted his militia.
But Caldwell said: He is a very significant part of the political process. 
We are in fact tracking his whereabouts.
Sadr leads a powerful political movement representing Iraq's urban Shiite masses, and heads a loosely organised militia called the Jaish al-Mahdi, or Mahdi Army, which US commanders accuse of taking part in sectarian attacks.
In the last six months, 700 people have been detained from the Jaish al-Mahdi whom we believe are associated with illegal activities, including death squads, Caldwell said.
Sadr has not been seen publicly in Iraq nor in Iran since the launch on February 14 of a joint US and Iraqi security plan to quell fighting between rival Sunni and Shiite militias in Baghdad.
He has not appeared at Friday prayers at his local mosque near his office in Kufa, central Iraq, since October 24.
The government in Tehran, which has been accused by Washington of supplying weapons and training to armed Shiite groups such as the Mahdi Army, denies that Sadr is in Iran.
In February, when US commanders first revealed his alleged disappearance, the Iraqi government attempted to play down its significance, saying Sadr was on a short, routine visit to Tehran and would soon return.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 on the Richter scale shook Monday the city of Bam in south-eastern Iran, the news agency ISNA reported.
No reports on damages were yet available.
More than 30,000 people were killed after a powerful quake devastated the city in December 2003.
The United States and France have three aircraft carrier battle groups in the Gulf region, U.S. and French naval sources said on Monday.
The USS Stennis carrier strike group arrived in late February with an additional 6,500 sailors to join the USS Dwight D Eisenhower carrier strike group.
The Stennis is in the region, in the Arabian sea outside the Gulf and Eisenhower is inside the Gulf, said Lieutenant-Commander Charlie Brown, a spokesman for U.S. Naval Central Command in Bahrain.
Having a second strike group here is to support ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and to reassure our regional partners of our commitment to the area, he said.
Strike groups are typically deployed with four to five frigates and destroyers and one submarine, but are then split up between different coalition task forces on arrival, he said.
The French aircraft carrier group Charles de Gaulle arrived in the Arabian Sea in mid-March for operations relating to Afghanistan, a spokesman for the French naval forces in Paris confirmed.
He said the carrier deployed with an air-defence frigate, two anti-submarine frigates, a supply ship and a submarine.
Asked if the carriers, the Stennis and Charles de Gaulle, were within easy reach of the Gulf, the U.S. Navy's Brown replied: I don't know about easy reach of the Gulf.
They are here to fly missions over Afghanistan.
You can't fly missions over Afghanistan from the Gulf because you'd have to fly over Iran.
Iran's southern coastline stretches into the Gulf of Oman and into the Arabian Sea.
Tensions rose last week between Iran and the West over Tehran's nuclear work and the capture of 15 British servicemen in the northern reaches of the Gulf.
On Sunday Iran said it would limit cooperation with the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog and resolved not to halt its atomic work after the Security Council voted to impose new sanctions.
The long-term use of aspirin, at low to moderate doses, appears to reduce all causes of mortality in women, especially in older women and those with cardiovascular risk factors, according to the results of a new study.
This is primarily due to a reduction in death from cardiovascular disease.
However, an accompanying editorial questions this finding and suggests that, on the basis of previous study findings, women without a history of cardiovascular disease should not start taking aspirin to prevent death.
Previous reports have indicated that aspirin use can lower the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer, which are major contributors to mortality in women. 
However, it is unclear if long-term aspirin use is actually associated with a reduced risk of mortality from all causes.
To investigate, Dr. Andrew T. Chan, from Harvard Medical School in Boston, and colleagues analyzed data from 79,439 women who were enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. 
All of the women were cancer- and heart disease-free when the investigation began.
Over 24 years, 9,477 of the women died, the researchers report in the Archives of Internal Medicine.
Current aspirin use was associated with a 25-percent reduced risk of mortality from any cause, compared with never using aspirin regularly.
In terms of specific causes of death, aspirin use was linked to a 38-percent reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 12-percent reduced risk of death due to cancer. 
The use of aspirin for 1 to 5 years seemed to provide protection against cardiovascular disease, whereas at least 10 years of use was required to prevent malignancy.
As noted, the survival benefits of long-term aspirin were most apparent in older women and in those with multiple cardiac risk factors.
In a related editorial, Dr. John A. Baron, from Dartmouth Medical School in Lebanon, New Hampshire, comments that the new findings for cardiovascular mortality are provocative, contrasting sharply with the pattern seen in primary prevention trials.
He also notes that the observational nature of the study may not have been able to deal with the differences between aspirin users and nonusers.
Therefore, he concludes that the study findings cannot overcome the accumulated evidence that aspirin is not particularly effective in preventing a death from a first-time cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack.
Most Americans have little or no confidence in the information they receive from the military or the media about the situation in Iraq, according to a poll released Thursday.
The survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 52 percent have little or no faith in the military's portrayal of the four-year war, compared with 60 percent who feel the same way about the press reports of the conflict.
The figures are a far cry from the overwhelming confidence Americans had in the military and the media at the outset of the war in March 2003.
At the time, fully 85 percent said they had at least a fair amount of confidence in military information and 81 percent were confident the press was giving an accurate picture of the war.
Michael Dimock, associate director of the Pew Research Center, said the poll findings mirror the public's perception of how well the war is going overall.
People are questioning whether they are getting good information about how things are going and it's affecting the public's confidence in the government and military as well as the press, Dimock told AFP.
He noted differences along party lines in how people responded to the survey questions with Democrats more skeptical about government information whereas Republicans were more leery of press coverage.
The survey of 1,038 adult Americans was conducted between March 30 and April 2 and had a 3.5 percent plus or minus margin of error.
Four people including a policeman were killed Friday in a suicide car bomb attack near the Afghan parliament in the capital Kabul, police said.
The bomber detonated a car filled with explosives a few hundred meters (yards) from the legislative building, killing three civilians and one policeman, Kabul criminal investigation police chief General Alishah Paktiawal told AFP.
It was a suicide bombing. 
Four people were killed and four others were injured, he said.
The 15 British sailors and marines seized by Iran in the Gulf said they were blindfolded, bound, kept in isolation and warned they faced up to seven years in jail.
We were blindfolded at all times and kept in isolation from each other, Lieutenant Felix Carman said.
In an agreed statement, the military personnel said they were told that if they did not admit they had strayed into Iranian waters, they faced seven years in prison.
We were interrogated most nights and given two options. 
If we admitted that we had strayed, we would be back on a plane to the UK pretty soon. If we didn't, we faced up to seven years in prison, they revealed.
They heard weapons being cocked behind them and feared the worst.
After their arrest in the Gulf, the sailors and marines were taken to a prison in Tehran. 
We were blindfolded, our hands were bound, we were forced up against a wall, they said in their statement.
They insisted they had been arrested in Iraqi waters and said that in captivity they suffered constant psychological pressure.
The sole woman among the group, Faye Turney, was kept isolated for several days and told by her captors that the others had been released and gone home.
The sailors and marines were released in Tehran on Thursday after a tense 13-day stand off and flown back to Britain for an emotional reunion with their families.
Britain has suspended boarding operations in the Gulf and is reviewing rules of engagement in the area's waters after their seizure, navy chief Jonathan Band said.
He said British forces were reviewing how they are handled in future amid disquiet over how easily the sailors were seized on March 23.
As part of this ongoing review, the operational procedures and the rules of engagement that go with them will be reconsidered, he told BBC Radio.
Iran still holds the only two boats used to carry out the search operations in the area.
Iran said they had strayed into its territory but Britain said they were in Iraqi waters on a regular U.N. mission.
Taliban fighters seized control of a district in the south of Afghanistan Friday, officials said, as a suicide bomber in a taxi killed six people near the national parliament in Kabul.
The violence came as President Hamid Karzai said he had met with members of the Taliban movement which is leading a deadly insurgency five years after being toppled by US-led forces to bring reconciliation to his country.
Karzai said Taliban representatives had been regularly meeting with government bodies, adding. 
I've had some Taliban coming to speak to me as well, so this process has been there for a long time.
But he ruled out talks with Taliban supremo Mullah Mohammad Omar, a close ally of Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden, or with foreign militants.
Hours before he spoke, 100 Taliban members overran Khak Afghan district in the troubled Zabul province, the latest of several rebel attempts to exert control in parts of southern and western Afghanistan.
Police made a tactical withdrawal after guerrillas attacked the headquarters of the mountainous district from several directions at once, said Ghulam Shah Alikhil, a spokesmen for the provincial governor.
There were no immediate plans in place to retake the area, he said.
The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which has tens of thousands of troops in Afghanistan, including US and Romanian soldiers in Zabul, said it was checking the information.
The Taliban have also occupied other districts in Afghanistan this year. 
In most cases, the rebels have been driven out after a short time.
In Kabul, a suicide bomber struck a few hundred metres (yards) from the parliament building killing five people including a policeman, the city's criminal investigation police chief General Alishah Paktiawal told AFP.
It was a suicide bombing 
The bomber was driving a yellow and white taxi, Paktiawal said. 
He said it was unclear if the attacker was targeting parliament but added that the device may have exploded prematurely.
The powerful blast was the third suicide attack in the heavily-secured capital this year. 
Such bombings have become common in resistance-hit southern Afghanistan but have previously been rare in Kabul.
Taliban commanders have vowed to launch a wave of suicide blasts this year, after nearly 140 last year across the country killed about 200 civilians as well as scores of Afghan and foreign security officials.
Meanwhile police said they were still searching for two missing French aid workers and their three Afghan colleagues after the Taliban said its fighters had kidnapped them on Tuesday in southwestern Nimroz province.
The two French nationals are from the organisation Terre d'Enfance (A World for Our Children).
Karzai however pledged to make no more hostage deals, saying that one he made last month to free an Italian journalist was because the Italian government which has 1,800 troops in Afghanistan could have collapsed.
Karzai ordered the release of five Taliban prisoners, including some high-profile figures, in March in the controversial trade which resulted in the freedom of kidnapped Italian reporter Daniele Mastrogiacomo.
It was an extraordinary situation and won't be repeated again, he said. 
No more deals with no one and with no other country.
Separately on Friday the Taliban killed five security guards in an attack on a construction company working on a highway near Qalat, the capital of Zabul province, officials said.
Gunmen kidnapped two Turkish engineers from their car in Port Harcourt in Nigeria's oil-producing Niger Delta, police said on Saturday.
One of the men works for Merpa, a Turkish firm that maintains telecoms equipment on one of the oil platforms of Italian firm Agip in the delta, said Agip's parent company Eni.
The employer of the second captive was not known.
They were intercepted by militants when they were driving late yesterday evening, said Felix Ogbaudu, police commissioner of Rivers State, where Port Harcourt is located.
Kidnappings for ransom or to press for benefits from oil firms are common in the Niger Delta, a vast wetlands in southern Nigeria that accounts for all oil production from the world's eighth-biggest exporter.
Most kidnap victims are released unharmed after a few days, though some have been kept in captivity for months and two have been killed in botched attempts by troops to free them.
Thousands of expatriate workers and their relatives have left the Niger Delta since the start of a wave of attacks on oil facilities and kidnappings of foreigners in late 2005.
Oil production has been reduced by 500,000 barrels per day, one fifth of Nigeria's production capacity, since a series of raids on Royal Dutch Shell oilfields in February last year forced their closure.
Violence in the delta is rooted in poverty and frustration at the lack of benefits for local people from an industry that has polluted their land, air and water for five decades.
Nigeria made $40 billion from oil exports last year, but most people in the delta have no access to clean water, electricity, roads or doctors because widespread corruption in government has led to a collapse in basic public services.
As a result, many local communities expect oil firms to step in where government has failed to and provide jobs, infrastructure and development projects.
But the lines between militancy and crime are blurred in the delta. 
Some armed groups have taken hostages to press political demands but many freelance kidnappers have seized foreigners to extract cash from their companies or from government.
Security forces in Yemen on Saturday arrested a man suspected of involvement in an attack on a mosque during which worshippers were sprayed with petrol and set on fire.
Amran district governor Taha Abdallah Hajer, quoted by the official Saba news agency, said the suspect was being interrogated to try to find out why the attack took place. 
He named the detained man as Hamid al-Shumi.
Thirty people were wounded, eight of them seriously, when unidentified men struck during Muslim Friday prayers at the mosque in Amran some 60 kilometres (40 miles) north of the capital Sanaa.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert arrived in Beijing on Tuesday morning for a three-day official visit to China.
During Olmert's visit, the first since he took office last May, Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao will meet or hold talks with him respectively on China-Israel relations, regional and international issues of common concern, sources with Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
He is also expected to attend a series of activities marking the 15th anniversary of the establishment of China-Israel diplomatic ties, the sources added.
Before his China visit, Olmert highlighted in an interview with Xinhua in Jerusalem that the development of the relations with China is exciting and promising.
He stressed that China is not only a big economic power, but an important country which plays a significant role in some regional and global issues.
As a son of a former Jewish resident in China, Olmert said he had a  spiritual tie with the Asian country.
The Chinese culture is part of my heritage and part of my earliest memory as a young kid in the state of Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister said. 
An Afghan civilian was killed when NATO forces opened fire after he failed to stop his vehicle that was approaching a NATO convoy in south-eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, the military said.
The incident took place in Orgun district of  Paktika province when the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) convoy was returning to their base and the car was approaching from the rear at high speed, ISAF said in a statement.
A warning shot was fired, however the vehicle failed to stop.  
A disabling shot was subsequently fired, regrettably killing one civilian who worked at the ISAF base in Orgun, the statement said.
An investigation into the incident is underway, it added.
A number of other Afghan civilians have been killed in a similar fashion as military forces seek to prevent more suicide bombings against Afghan and foreign troops, who have been targeted by explosives-filled cars colliding with their military vehicles.
More than 120 suicide attacks took place last year in Afghanistan, five times more than in 2005.
As a precaution, ISAF forces have installed boards on the backs of their vehicles, warning locals not to get close to their convoy or risk being shot. 
Only 30 per cent of the 30 million-strong Afghan population, however, can read and write.
Thirty-one people were killed on Tuesday when their chartered plane crashed while trying to land in foggy conditions in Iraq, Turkish officials said.
The Moldovan Antonov-26, which took off from the Turkish city of Adana early on Tuesday, was carrying about 35 people including 30 construction workers, the officials said.
The plane came down at about midday Turkish time (1000 GMT) some 2.5 km (1.5 miles) to the northwest of Balad, a Foreign Ministry official told Reuters. 
He put the death toll at 31 and said one person was injured and three were missing.
Adana's governor Cahit Kirac told CNN Turk television that the plane was carrying 29 Turks, one American and a crew comprising one Russian, one Ukrainian and three Moldovans.
Balad is the main U.S. military logistics hub in Iraq, about 80 km (50 miles) north of the capital Baghdad. Turkish media initially reported that the crash occurred in Baghdad.
The plane belonged to Moldova's Aerian Tur Airlines and the workers on board were from the Turkish construction company Kulak, the Foreign Ministry official said.
The U.S. military, which controls Iraqi air space, declined to comment.
There was no suggestion that hostile fire had brought down the plane. 
In 2005, hostile ground-to-air fire brought down a British military transport plane in the same area, killing all on board.
Police in Israel are to initiate investigations into Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on suspicion of corruption, the Israeli Aruz 10 channel reported Tuesday.
Ehud is to be questioned about several probable corruption affairs on his return from China, the television report added.
The investigations are to focus mainly on whether he helped business friends of his in a bid to privatize the Israeli bank Leumi when Olmert was Israel's minister of finance.
Olmert has been accused of corruption on several occasions, but has never been sentenced. 
He has always denied the accusations.
Cold War leader Daniel Ortega returns to power in Nicaragua on Wednesday, giving Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez a new leftist ally as he tries to steer Latin America away from the United States.
Ortega, who first took power in a 1979 revolution and then led a Marxist government for 11 years while fighting a brutal civil war against U.S.-backed Contra rebels, completed a remarkable comeback by winning a November presidential vote.
The balding 61-year-old Sandinista leader is still a socialist but has dropped many radical economic policies from the 1980s, saying he has learned from his mistakes.
Ortega promises to respect private property and the free market this time around even as he fights poverty. He preaches reconciliation and has ditched Marxism for religion, winning the trust of church leaders and some former battlefield foes.
Our commitment is work, peace and reconciliation, Ortega said on the eve of his inauguration.
But his election victory was still a blow to Washington in a region where its influence has waned as poor voters left behind by free-market reforms have in recent years picked leftist leaders aligned with Venezuela's anti-U.S. Chavez.
Ortega insists he wants good relations with the United States, but his closest allies in Latin America are Chavez, Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Bolivian President Evo Morales.
Chavez also took office, for his third term, on Wednesday, and promises to deepen his leftist revolution by nationalizing utility companies and seeking the power to rule by decree.
The Sandinista revolution in 1979 toppled a U.S.-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza. 
Literacy and health care improved dramatically at first but mismanagement and the war then plunged the country into years of economic chaos.
Pro-U.S. governments have ruled in Nicaragua since Ortega was ousted in a 1990 election and Ortega failed in two successive attempts to win back power at the ballot box.
Spending more time around the family dinner table and less time in front of the TV can help prevent kids from getting fat, a new study shows.
Among 8,000 children followed from kindergarten to third grade, those who watched the most TV were at the greatest risk of being or becoming overweight, Dr. Sara Gable of the University of Missouri, Columbia and her colleagues found. 
And the fewer meals children ate each week with their families, the more likely they were to put on excess pounds.
Families need to work together to help children maintain a healthy weight, Gable told Reuters Health in an e-mail message.
Even the simple things, like how often families eat together and the amount of time that children spend watching television, play a role in children's weight status.
The risk of being persistently overweight increased by 3 percent for every additional hour a child spent watching TV each week, the researchers found, while each family meal missed per week increased the risk of persistent overweight by 8 percent. 
Living in a neighborhood perceived as unsafe for outside exercise also substantially increased the risk of being overweight.
Kids who stayed at a normal weight throughout the study watched 14.12 hours of TV a week, compared with 15.63 hours for those who became overweight and 16.09 hours for those who were overweight for the entire study period.
Children who did not become overweight ate 10.26 meals a week with their families, compared with 9.54 for children who became overweight and 9.57 for persistently overweight children.
While the actual percentages for increased risk were small, the investigators note that even a small effect matters when the base rate of the phenomenon in question is as high as the prevalence of overweight in a general population. 
They add that 17% of the children in the current study were overweight by third grade.
Children rely on parents to initiate such things as family mealtimes and to set limits on children's TV time, Gable told Reuters Health. 
Teaching children about healthy habits requires the whole family's involvement children are not going to learn these things on their own.
A second Chinese engineering battalion headed for Lebanon  on Jan 22 to join the UN peacekeeping mission there.
The second engineering battalion comprises of 275 personnel as well as a medical team consisting of 60 members.
A total of 143 peacekeepers took a UN chartered flight on the evening of Jan. 22 from Kunming, capital of southwest Yunnan Province, to replace the first engineering battalion deployed from the same military command in April 2006.
The rest of the battalion will leave for Lebanon in February.
China has sent 6,000 military personnel to participate in 16 UN peacekeeping operations since its first contributions to UN operations in the 1990s.
Tamil Tigers shot dead four security personnel, including two soldiers, as fighting continued to rage in Sri Lanka's embattled northeast where the military has captured a key rebel-held town.
Five civilians were also shot dead by unidentified attackers in the northern town of Vavuniya, police said today. 
There had been at least 10 other killings of civilians in Vavuniya district in the past week.
The police said the latest victim, a top official at the local transport authority, was shot dead as he was riding a motorcycle home with his wife this evening.
The two soldiers were killed last night in the eastern district of Batticaloa, where troops took the main rebel stronghold of Vakarai on Friday, the defence ministry said.
It said one Tiger rebel was also killed.
Two police constables were killed late last night, also in the district of Vavuniya, in two separate incidents.
Both killings were blamed on the Tigers. 
The ground troops who captured Vakarai in the island's east were clearing the area of mines and booby-traps for a second consecutive day, officials said.
The military Sunday said it had found 37 dead bodies of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels near Vakarai, taking the toll from weeks of fighting to above 430.
Vakarai originally housed about 35,000 civilians, but an estimated 20,000 have fled in recent weeks. 
Palestinian fighters abducted three French nationals in the northern West Bank city of Nablus Tuesday, security officials said.
Fighters of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades -the semi-official, semi-independent armed wing of President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party- said they had found arms on the three Frenchmen and accused them of being members of an Israeli undercover unit.
But the Palestinian security officials said they were security guards travelling with a French delegation visiting Nablus.
An Israeli army spokeswoman said no Israeli army force was operating in Nablus Tuesday.
The three had been abducted by unknown individuals who followed them to their hotel in Nablus before taking them away on foot, witnesses said.
Palestinian security sources said everything was being done to free them.
In Paris, a spokesman for the French foreign ministry confirmed reports that the three abducted individuals were French citizens. However, no details of their identity were provided.
Israeli Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer on Tuesday hinted that his country should consider producing nuclear power for civilian purposes.
It is our duty to keep the option to produce energy through other ways, Ben Eliezer said in a speech at an annual conference on Israel's national security in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv.
Given the conditions that have surrounded Israel from the day it was created and its unique geo-political situation, I believe it is not enough to rely on energy production through conventional means, he said.
A senior official in the ministry told AFP that Ben Eliezer was referring to the need to develop nuclear energy technology for civilian purposes.
Although Israel is considered to be the region's only nuclear power, it refuses to say whether it does or does not have nuclear technology or weapons.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert caused an international uproar last month when he placed his country on a list of states possessing nuclear weapons during an interview with German television.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a defiant message to the United States on Tuesday, saying Washington could not hurt Tehran by waging what he called a psychological war.
They are not in a position to hurt us, they do not have the power to do so, their pressure is mostly psychological, he said in a televised speech aired late Tuesday.
They think that they can intimidate and dismay the Iranian people in order to break the Iranian people's unity, he said. 
This is a psychological war.
Ahmadinejad spoke after coming under increasing criticism from both conservatives and reformists for his handling of foreign and domestic policy, including Tehran's disputed nuclear drive.
The latest criticism came from Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, who was once appointed to succeed the founder of the Islamic revolution but fell from grace in the late 1980s.
It is necessary to act with reason with the enemy and not provoke it. 
Extremism does not do people any good, Montazeri said.
We say death to America, but the United States is a power with important means, Montazeri was quoted as saying in a meeting with a group of liberal opposition groups.
In his speech on Tuesday, Ahmadinejad said his comments were based on thorough analysis and consultations. 
They (the United States) say they are sending another warship, so what ... we are not worried. 
The only way to neutralize all this is through unity, he said. 
US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns warned Tuesday that Washington would not allow Iran to control the oil-rich Gulf and was sending a second aircraft carrier battlegroup to keep Tehran in check.
Iran has... to understand that the United States has interests, as do Gulf Arab and European countries, Burns said during a visit to the United Arab Emirates.
That's why you have seen the United States station two carrier battlegroups in the Gulf in recent weeks, Burns said, referring to the USS John C. Stennis, which is due to join the Dwight D. Eisenhower in the region.
Burns said the United States, which suspects Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons, was not seeking a war with Tehran and wanted a diplomatic solution to the standoff over the Iranian nuclear programme.
Burns ruled out negotiations with Iran unless it met the international community request to suspend uranium enrichment work.
Iran says it only wants to enrich uranium for peaceful energy ends.
Ahmadinejad said that Tehran had always been ready for talks based on logic.
I told them I'm coming to New York, ready for debate, but they did not accept, he added. 
Those nations which are nuclear do not want others to join them -- yes, the US are pressuring us, he said.
While considerable attention has been given to women's risk of suffering fractures as they age, a new study shows that once an older person has sustained a fracture there's no significant difference between men and women in their risk of having another fracture. 
The report in the latest Journal of the American Medical Association confirms that men and women 60 years of age orolder are at heightened risk for all types of fractures after sustaining an initial low-trauma fracture.
Moreover, the risk appears to be greatest in the 5 to 10 years following the first fracture. 
Dr. Jacqueline R. Center, from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Darlinghurst, Australia, and colleagues therefore recommend early initiation of fracture prevention therapy for everyone who sustains a low-trauma fracture. 
The findings are based on a study of 2245 women and 1760 men who were followed from 1989 to 2005. 
During this period, 905 women and 337 men suffered an initial fracture, the investigators note. Of these subjects, 253 women and 71 men had a repeat fracture. 
The risk of recurrent fracture was comparable for men and women, with the equivalent of 57 and 62 cases occurring every year for every 1000 men and women, respectively, who suffered a prior fracture. 
The increased risk of re-fracture persisted for up to 10 years after the original fracture. 
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to comprehensively examine all low-trauma fractures in a concurrent group of men and women aged 60 years and older over a 16-year period, the authors conclude. 
They say that awareness of osteoporosis and its treatment particularly in relation to men, should be the focus of education initiatives.
Nine kidnapped Chinese oil workers were released safely on Sunday morning, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
The nine were set free following 11 days of tough diplomatic efforts, Xinhua news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu as saying.
She said the released workers would return to China soon.
Armed assailants attacked a Chinese oil company compound in southern Nigeria on Januay 25, and kidnapped the nine workers.
Bandits and kidnappers often prey upon foreign oil workers in Nigeria.
Military action against Iran with the goal of shutting down its nuclear programme would be highly dangerous and counter-productive, according to an independent British report published Monday. 
The report, which concludes that diplomatic solutions to the issue must be resolutely pursued, says that while Britain and Prime Minister Tony Blair can play a major role in resolving the impasse by putting pressure on the United States, only through direct US-Iranian engagement can an agreement be found.
Among the report's authors are the development charity Oxfam, the Blairite think-tank the Foreign Policy Centre, along with Unison, Amicus and the GMB -- three of Britain's biggest trade unions.
Also co-authoring the report are religious organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain, and Pax Christi, an international Christian anti-war charity.
The consequences of any possible future military action could be wholly counter-productive as well as highly dangerous. 
Diplomatic solutions to the Iranian nuclear issue must be pursued resolutely, the report read.
It noted several possible negative consequences of any military action, including paradoxically strengthening the resolve of the Iranian regime to become a nuclear weapons power and the likelihood of Iran's exit from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
According to the authors, another possible consequence would be an inflammation of the war on terror, along with a chance that the European Union, which partially depends on Iran for its energy needs, could feel the squeeze and possibly even experience recession.
It called for Britain to use its diplomatic clout with the United States to advocate for direct US engagement which it says is essential to resolving the current situation.
The UN Security Council late last year passed a resolution imposing limited sanctions on Iran for its refusal to halt uranium enrichment -- the process that makes nuclear fuel as well as material for making an atomic bomb. 
The West fears the nuclear programme is covertly designed to make weapons, while Iran insists it is entirely peaceful.
About 1,000 U.S. Army troops will deploy to Iraq three months earlier than planned as part of the military's stepped-up effort to halt sectarian violence there, the Defense Department said on Friday.
The troops from the 3rd Infantry Division based at Fort Stewart, Georgia, will go to Iraq in March instead of June and they will assist with intelligence, surveillance, and command and control duties, the Pentagon said.
President George W. Bush said last month he would send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq to try to help quell insurgent attacks. 
The accelerated deployment of the unit is part of that effort, a spokesman at Fort Stewart said.
The early deployment was announced as the U.S. House of Representatives approved a symbolic, nonbinding resolution opposing Bush's plan to send more troops to Iraq. 
The Senate is expected to vote on Saturday on whether to debate the House resolution.
U.S. force levels in Iraq continue to be conditions-based, and are determined upon the recommendations of military commanders in Iraq and in consultation with the Iraqi government, the military said in the statement.
There are approximately 141,000 U.S. troops currently in Iraq, according to the Pentagon.
The chief diplomats of Canada, Mexico and the United States will meet February 23 in Ottawa to discuss border security, trade and energy partnership, the Canadian government said Friday.
Washington will send US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez to the meeting, the Canadian government said in a statement.
Mexico will be represented by Foreign Affairs Secretary Patricia Espinosa, Interior Secretary Francisco Javier Ramirez Acuna and Commerce Secretary Eduardo Sojo Garza-Aldape.
Canadian Foreign Minister Peter MacKay, Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day and Industry Minister Maxime Bernier will host the meeting.
The trio will meet with their Canadian and Mexican counterparts to discuss how the three democracies are working together to ensure continued prosperity and how we can provide greater security for all of North America, Rice's spokesman Sean McCormack said in a statement.
The three North American neighbors launched the Security and Prosperity Partnership in March 2005 to bolster cooperation on border security, trade and energy.
The three economies are otherwise joined by the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The window and frame through which Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed former US president John F Kennedy was sold on auction site Ebay for more than 3 million dollars on Friday.
The piece was being auctioned by Caruth Byrd, whose family owned the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas, where, from the sixth floor, Oswald fired the shots that killed JFK on November 22, 1963.
The mystery buyer, listed as r.seydel and based in the Netherlands according to his page on Ebay's website, paid 3,001,501 dollars to acquire the window, well past a starting bid for the piece of 100,000 dollars.
The window was taken out of the depository weeks after Kennedy's assassination and held for more than two decades by Caruth Byrd's  ather Harold. 
When Caruth inherited the item after his father's death, he had it placed in a museum in Dallas commemorating the assassination, where it has been for more than 10 years.
Like all the details surrounding JFK's death, there are conspiracies that the window is not authentic. 
But Byrd said on the Ebay page auctioning the piece that he will provide the winning bidder all the official documentation and contracts related to the window and frame's authenticity.
Don't miss this opportunity to own a piece of history, Byrdwrote.
At least 10 people were killed and scores injured Saturday when a powerful bomb exploded near a court in Pakistan's southwestern city of Quetta, the interior ministry said.
The blast, near the civil court, struck inside a compound also housing police offices. 
The majority of the dead are lawyers, officials said.
Ten people, most of them lawyers, were killed and many others are wounded, a senior interior ministry official told AFP.
Provincial home minister Shoaib Nosherwani said a senior civil judge, Wahid Durrani, was also among the dead.
It was a very powerful blast and we are investigating whether it was caused by a planted bomb or it was a suicide attack, he told the Geo television channel.
He said around 50 people were also wounded in the explosion. 
The channel quoted police sources putting the death toll at 13.
Quetta police officer Rehmatullah Niazi said the bomb exploded just outside the civil court, next to the police office that issues driving licences.
Quetta is the capital of Baluchistan province bordering Afghanistan and Iran. 
It has been troubled by recurring violence blamed on ethnic Baluch rebels demanding greater political rights and share in the profits from the region's natural resources.
Pakistani security forces are already on a high alert in the wake of a wave of terrorist attacks, including three suicide bombings in recent weeks.
A double car bombing killed at least 10 people and wounded 60 in a crowded market in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Saturday, police sources said.
The explosions occurred in Kirkuk's Rahim Awa district, a predominantly Kurdish area of the ethnically mixed city. 
Several cars and shops were burnt out.
Hospital officials said the condition of many of the wounded was considered life-threatening.
Iraqi officials fear violence may increase outside the capital Baghdad as U.S. and Iraqi forces step up a crackdown on insurgents and militias in the city.
Some officials say militants are avoiding confrontation in Baghdad or may have left the city.
Two Picasso paintings worth some 50 million euros ($66 million) were stolen this week from the Paris home of a grand-daughter of the Spanish painter, police said on Wednesday.
The paintings were stolen in the night of Monday to Tuesday by burglars who broke into the woman's apartment in the smart seventh arrondissement of the French capital.
No further information was immediately available.
Many more suicide bomber cells are operating in Afghanistan and more suicide attacks by Taliban militants can be expected in the coming months, a NATO spokesman said on Wednesday.
We know for a fact that there has been recent intelligence to suggest that there was a threat of bombing in the Bagram area. 
It is clear that there are suicide bomber cells operating in this country, Colonel Tom Collins, spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan told reporters.
Collins' comments came after a deadly attack on Tuesday as US Vice President Dick Cheney was visiting the US military's primary base in Afghanistan, located in Bagram.
Cheney was unhurt by the blast at the base gates but at least 9 people including a US and a South Korean soldier were killed and over 20 others wounded.
Prior to Tuesday's bombing intelligence had suggested that the Taliban had the capability to carry out attacks in the city of Kabul and in the Bagram area, Collins said.
Asked if the alliance were expecting more attacks by Taliban militants, Collins said: Unfortunately we do expect more attacks and the enemy knows that it cannot defeat ANSF (Afghan National Security Force) and ISAF forces in a conventional sense, so we do expect that they increasingly go after soft targets, which means innocent civilians.
He played down Taliban claims that the attack targeted Cheney.
We do know for sure that the Taliban's claims that they were going after the vice president are really absurd.
There was never any threat to the vice president.
To suggest that the enemy has gone after the vice president, we are not ready to say that. 
It might be coincidence, we don't know at this point, Collins insisted, adding that the claim was intended to have more psychological impact on the Afghan population.
He put the death toll of Tuesday's suicide attack at nine killed and another 21 wounded. 
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi won a confidence vote in the Senate on Wednesday, allowing him to stay in office and drawing an end to a political crisis prompted by his resignation a week ago.
Prodi won with 162 votes for and 157. 
He would have had a majority even without the support of four unelected life senators who voted for him.
A second confidence vote is due on Friday in the lower house, where Prodi has a much more comfortable majority.
I am very satisfied, now we'll go to the lower house, he  told reporters.
Prodi resigned last week after nine months in office over a foreign policy defeat in the Senate after some leftist members in his nine-party coalition voted against him.
He got a second chance from President Giorgio Napolitano after he rallied his fractious allies behind him playing on their fears that a defeat would clear the way for conservative Silvio Berlusconi to return to power.
However, a poll published on Wednesday suggested only four in 10 Italians want the centre-left leader to stay on.
Most favour a non-partisan technical government or snap elections, showed the poll in Corriere della Sera daily.
Thirty-nine percent said Prodi would last only a few months and 22 percent gave him 1 to 2 years but not a complete five-year term.
The United States and North Korea will hold working group talks in New York on March 5-6 on the normalization of relations, the U.S. State Department said on Wednesday but played down expectations of any breakthrough.
I would caution you that this meeting is just a first step. 
It is an initial conversation, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters. 
Don't look at it as a meeting that is going to produce immediate results. 
Nobody is going to come out the front door and wave a piece of paper with some agreement on it.
Such talks are envisaged under the Feb. 13 agreement in which North Korea agreed to take steps toward nuclear disarmament in exchange for $300 million in aid.
The agreement, reached four months after Pyongyang stunned the world with its first nuclear test, requires the secretive communist state to shut down the reactor at the heart of its nuclear ambitions and to allow international inspections.
The deal also called for a working group on the normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations to meet within 30 days. 
McCormack said the United States would be represented in New York by Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill and  North Korea by its top nuclear negotiator Kim Kye-gwan.
He said Kim would arrive in San Francisco on or around March 1 and would hold meetings with non-governmental organizations and others there before traveling to New York on March 2.
A man who spent five years at the US prison camp in Guantanamo Bay was released on bail on Thursday after serving two months' jail in Bangladesh, his lawyer said.
Mubarak Hussain Bin Abul Hashem, 32, was held for questioning over alleged anti-state activities in December, after being flown back from the US base in Cuba.
He was also charged with failing to produce a passport when he was repatriated to Bangladesh on a special US plane.
He was released last night from Dhaka central jail after serving out his detention, Mubarak's lawyer Mohammad Jashimuddin said. 
His relatives later took him to his village home, he added.
Police said earlier that Mubarak broke the law by overstaying in Pakistan on a tourist visa in 1998.
He was arrested in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001 attacks and flown to Guantanamo -- but was released after investigators there found no evidence he had links to Islamic militants.
Another Bangladeshi man is still being held at the controversial US prison camp, where the right to appear in court and other civil rights have been sharply curtailed.
Human rights groups and media reports have documented several cases of mistaken detention and abuse at the camp, where inmates are treated as prisoners of war under special US rules related to its war on terror.
Mubarak's father, a Muslim cleric, has denied that his son was involved in any militant activities and accused the US authorities of destroying his life.
Human rights groups also rejected the new charge as a pretext to keep him in custody.
This is a violation of his rights, said Sultana Kamal, of the Bangladesh human rights group Ain-O-Salishi Kendro (Law and Justice Centre).
It is not clear how this can have happened, but the case appears to be baseless, added Elina Khan, of the Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights.
Israeli troops left Nablus Thursday, after five days of searches in the northern West Bank city during which they killed one person and arrested several suspected militants, Palestinian eyewitnesses and officials said.
An Israeli army spokeswoman however would not confirm whether the operation, codenamed Warm Winter and the largest in the West Bank in months, had ended.
Israeli armoured vehicles and military jeeps had left already in the early morning, but some troops stayed behind, surrounding a number of buildings in the downtown area for wanted militants still on the run.
But those troops left as well later in the day after finding the buildings empty, witnesses said, adding no soldiers could be seen throughout the city by the afternoon.
Shops and businesses in downtown Nablus were seriously damaged during the operation after being forced open by soldiers as they searched the area, Mayor Adli Yaish told Voice of Palestine Radio.
Buildings also suffered extensive bullet holes and some roads were damaged by the heavy Israeli military equipment.
Israel said it launched the operation early Sunday, dubbing Nablus the biggest centre of militant activity in the west Bank.
It said that 117 potential suicide bombers arrested in 2006 had come from the northern West Bank city, which is mainly a stronghold of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the violent, semi-independent, semi-official armed wing of President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party. 
The radical Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) are also active in the city.
According to the Israeli military, nine out of 11 bomb belts tracked down in the last six months also emanated from Nablus.
Israeli troops had already briefly left the city on Tuesday, but returned the next day to resume the operation.
U.S. pressure, including congressional threats to cut or put conditions on billions of dollars in aid, could destabilize Pakistan and maybe even bring down President Pervez Musharraf, Islamabad's envoy to Washington said on Thursday.
In an interview with Reuters, Ambassador Mahmud Ali Durrani expressed concern that anti-terrorism cooperation among the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan was eroding and rejected what he said were attempts to unfairly blame Islamabad for an upsurge in cross-border violence.
Tampering with U.S. aid levels will fan anti-Americanism, strengthen the extreme right and Taliban supporters, be counterproductive, and create problems for Musharraf to be able to continue the way he is, Durrani said.
Asked if it might trigger Musharraf's ouster, he replied, I don't know. 
Possibly it could bring him down. 
It could destabilize the whole country. 
It could cause mega-problems there. 
That is possible.
His comments came after top American intelligence officials said the front-line U.S. ally in the war on terrorism had allowed a resurgence of al Qaeda and Taliban forces and training camps in Pakistani tribal areas that could someday lead to another Sept. 11-type attack on the United States.
What I'm worried about today more than anything else is this unhinging of the cooperative relationship ... In this very critical field of (cooperation on) counter-terrorist operations there seems to be a problem. 
We need to fix it, Durrani said.
U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney visited Afghanistan and Pakistan earlier this week and urged Musharraf to take tougher action against hardliners on his side of the lawless border. 
He also called attention to efforts by the U.S. Congress to restrict or alter billions of dollars in annual U.S. aid to Pakistan.
Taliban leader captured.
On Thursday, Pakistani security forces captured a high-ranking Taliban leader in the southwestern city of Quetta, a senior Pakistani security official and Taliban sources reported.
The Bush administration considers Musharraf a key ally who has taken great risks to help defeat Afghan-based guerrillas after the Sept. 11 attacks, including by providing access to bases and overflight rights.
But with continued instability in Afghanistan and reports that hardliners are building new bases in Pakistan possibly abetted by Pakistani intelligence services, many in Washington wonder whether a new strategy is needed.
A recent report by experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies questioned whether the U.S. alliance with Musharraf has run its course, while acknowledging there is no obvious successor to lead nuclear-armed Pakistan as a moderate Muslim state.
Durrani argued that the United States, distracted by Iraq, failed to finish the job in Afghanistan and is now looking for someone to blame.
He acknowledged problems in Pakistani tribal areas, including a possibility of some presence of al Qaeda, definitely some presence of Taliban but he insisted 90 percent of the violence stems from Afghanistan.
Some U.S. experts have questioned whether more than $10 billion in aid to Pakistan over the past five years may be too heavily weighted towards military operations and should focus more on education and other softer projects, but Durrani said the mix should not be changed.
He urged Washington to expedite delivery of attack helicopters and night vision devices in time for an expected Taliban spring offensive.
Findings from a study of Olympic wrestlers indicate that hepatitis B virus is found in the sweat of infected individuals, and so sweating might be a way that the virus could be passed between participants in contact sports.
Bleeding wounds and mucous membranes have been implicated in hepatitis B transmission during contact sports, but until now no study had looked to see if sweat carries the virus.
Dr. S. Bereket-Yucel, from Celal Bayar University in Izmir, Turkey, tested for DNA of the hepatitis B virus in blood and sweat samples from 70 male Olympic wrestlers.
The results indicated that 9 (13 percent) of the wrestlers had the hepatitis B virus in their blood. 
However, these were deemed occult infections because no antibodies to the virus were detected in any of the wrestlers, according to the investigators' report released Thursday ahead of print by the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
In eight of the nine participants whose blood tested positive, DNA for hepatitis B was also detected in sweat.
Based on these results, Evidence is emerging that the incidence of occult HBV in Olympic wrestling is higher than expected and that transmission of HBV may also occur through sweat, the researcher concludes.
The advice of sports organizations about HBV testing should be changed, they recommend, making it obligatory for all participants involved in contact sports and playing under adult rules to be vaccinated against hepatitis B.
Tornadoes ripped across the Southern and Midwestern United States on Thursday, killing at least 14 people including eight in the southern Alabama town of Enterprise, emergency management officials said.
The victims in Enterprise died when a twister caused part of a high school to collapse, and five people were killed elsewhere across Alabama, officials said. 
Another death was reported in Missouri.
The Montgomery Advertiser newspaper said state emergency managers were asked to send a mass fatality recovery team to Enterprise in Alabama's Coffee County.
Emergency officials told local television that at least one teacher was among those killed at the school. 
CNN quoted an eyewitness as saying he carried the bodies of two young girls out of the building.
Enterprise has suffered major and widespread damage, said Alabama Gov. Bob Riley, who sent 100 National Guard troops to Enterprise and put additional troops on alert.
State officials sent search and rescue teams, ambulances, generators and emergency lights to aid the search for survivors.
In the town of Caulfield in south-central Missouri, a tornado killed a girl in a mobile home and damaged six other homes and two gasoline stations, officials said.
Parts of several Midwestern states and regions as far south as the Gulf Coast to the Florida Panhandle had been under tornado watches or warnings most of the day.
To the best of our knowledge there was at least one significant tornado that went through the city of Enterprise but we won't know if there was more than one before tomorrow when we send a team to conduct a storm survey of the affected area, said Tom Bradshaw, a meteorologist in Fort Worth, Texas, with the National Weather Service headquarters for the southern region.
Several counties in Alabama and also Georgia are currently under tornado warnings, he said.
An Australian citizen captured in Afghanistan and held at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp will be tried on charges of providing military support for terrorism, the US Defence Department said Thursday.
David Matthew Hicks, 31, an Australian-born convert to Islam, will not face the death penalty, according to Defence Department officials. 
If convicted, he could be allowed to serve a prison sentence in Australia.
He will be the first prisoner to be tried under the new system of military tribunals established by the United States for use against some prisoners in the war on terrorism, after passage last year of the Military Commissions Act.
The Pentagon's Office of Military Commissions referred the charge against Hicks with two specifications. 
Officials expect his trial to begin by summer.
He was captured in December 2001 in Afghanistan, becoming known as the so-called Australian Taliban.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard has long lobbied for Hicks to be charged or released.
Five Europeans kidnapped in Ethiopia 12 days ago have been released and are in good health, British foreign minister Margaret Beckett said on Tuesday.
The three British men, one Italian-British woman and a French woman all have links to the British diplomatic community in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
All five were released earlier today to the Eritrean authorities and have just arrived in the care of our embassy in Asmara, Beckett told reporters. I understand that broadly they are all in good health.
They were seized by armed attackers while travelling in Ethiopia's remote northeast Afar region.
Eight Ethiopians assisting the Europeans were also taken hostage but their fate remained unclear, Beckett said.
Regional officials and Afar locals had said the hostages were marched into neighbouring Eritrea -- something Eritrea denied.
Beckett said there were varying reports as to where the hostages had been held but certainly they were released with the help of the Eritrean government.
The five Europeans were named as Peter Rudge and Jonathan Ireland, first secretary and administrative support at the British Embassy in Addis Ababa, Malcolm Smart and Laure Beaufils working for the Department for International Development in the Ethiopian capital and Rosanna Moore, wife of the head of the British Council there.
The interim government in Bangladesh Tuesday sent to prison Tarique Rahman, the elder of two sons of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, over corruption charges filed by police, officials said.
Rahman, who had reportedly amassed huge wealth through questionable means, was arrested by security forces last week and was under interrogation by government intelligence agencies.
The army backed caretaker administration rejected the bail plea by Rahman, defence lawyers said disclosing however that they would move the High Court with a similar petition.
Metropolitan magistrate Mamun-al Robiul sent Rahman to the maximum security Dhaka Central Jail with a month's detention.
After Rahman, 42, complained of serious health problems in a crowded prison cell, he was removed to the jail hospital for medical treatment.
Earlier, Rahman faced investigations after he was accused of taking extortion money from a real estate developer.
Official sources said as senior joint secretary general of the former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Rahman allegedly collected 'speed money' from businesses to hasten the approval of commercial projects by the slow moving bureaucracy.
Rahman, who is expected to succeed his mother Khaleda Zia, made some sensational disclosures after he was remanded to police for quizzing.
The non-party government was formed in January amid an impasse between Zia and Sheikh Hasina who leads the Awami League.
Elections were planned for January 22 but were stalled midway by a state of emergency declared by President Iajuddin Ahmad banning all political activities to stop the country from sliding into chaos.
Two men were arrested in India Wednesday on suspicion of links to last month's bombing of an India-Pakistan train which killed 68 people, a senior police official told AFP.
The two men were picked up from (the central Indian city of) Indore, said R.C. Mishra, deputy inspector general of police in the northern state of Haryana, where the attack took place.
They were linked to the purchase of the suitcases in which the bombs were packed, the police official and top investigator told AFP.
Mishra did not identify the two, but the Press Trust of India news agency said they were bag shop managers who had supplied the covers for the suitcases in which the bombs were concealed.
They were named as Huzaifa, a Muslim, and Poonam Singh Thakur, a Hindu.
The pair were being questioned in Indore and would be taken to Haryana later in the day, it said. 
It was not clear if the two were suspected of being directly involved in the plot.
The blasts -- caused by the explosion of four bombs -- occurred about midnight on February 18, killing mainly Muslims who were travelling home to Pakistan on the cross-border Friendship Express.
The attack appeared to be aimed at undermining the stop-go peace process between India and Pakistan launched in 2004.
Indian police teams have released sketches of two suspects who were believed to have planted the bombs, and briefly detained seven people from three northern states for questioning last month.
Leaders of the dominant clan in Somalia's capital said on Sunday a shaky, three-day-old ceasefire remained in place after talks with Ethiopian soldiers who back the interim government.
Hawiye elders have been negotiating with the government and Ethiopian military since about 20 people died last week in the worst violence in Mogadishu since a war to oust Islamists began earlier this year.
The upsurge in violence came after the government launched a campaign to disarm parts of Mogadishu.
Hawiye clan elder and spokesman Ahmed Diriye Diriye said the disarmament plan was on hold following orders from Addis Ababa, and said, The ceasefire is still in place.
Diriye also said the government had been urged to send back troops that had come from the northern province of Puntland, another bone of contention for Mogadishu residents.
Pacifying Mogadishu is a momentous task for the interim government, which ended six months of Islamist rule in the city with the help of Ethiopia's military in a two-week offensive at the end of 2006.
An al Qaeda leader advised Somali Islamist fighters in a video posted on the Internet on Sunday to wage a guerrilla-style war against government forces, its Ethiopian allies and African Union peacekeepers.
Adopt guerrilla war as it is the most durable form of battle with the least losses and biggest (enemy) casualties ... let the volcano erupt, said Abu Yahya al-Libi, who is believed to have escaped from a U.S. jail in Afghanistan in 2005.
Wage a raid after another, ambush them, shake the ground under their feet with bombs, destroy their bastions with martyrdom operations and car bombs.     
The government, headed by President Abdullahi Yusuf from the Darod clan, is facing an resistance from Islamists and clan militia in the coastal capital.
Hawiye leaders also met during the weekend with officials from an African Union (AU) peacekeeping force in Somalia, which is made up of 1,200 soldiers from Uganda.
AU officials introduced themselves, shared with the Hawiye leaders their mission's mandate and told them that they want a stable Somalia, said one person at the meeting, who asked not to be named.
The formation of Yusuf's government is the 14th attempt to restore central rule to Somalia since 1991. 
He has called a national reconciliation conference for April 16, but whether it is held will depend on security in the city.
A series of aftershocks continued to hit central Japan on Monday following a powerful quake that jolted the area the previous day, bringing the total number of injured to 193 in the three prefectures of Ishikawa, Toyama and Niigata.
According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, the number of houses completely or partially destroyed reached 570 as of 8:30 a.m. Monday.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Diet the government will make utmost efforts to ensure safety for people in the area as early as possible following the Sunday quake, which killed one person.
We will make all efforts to support the disaster victims and to restore the quake-hit area, Abe said at the House of Councillors Budget Committee.
At 7:16 a.m. Monday, an aftershock with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 hit the vicinity of Ishikawa Prefecture, registering 4 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. 
No tsunami warning was issued over the quake.
The agency announced Monday there is a 70 percent probability that aftershocks with a magnitude 5 or higher will occur in the next three days and a 10 percent probability for aftershocks with a magnitude 6 or higher.
A government investigation team led by Kensei Mizote, state minister in charge of disaster management, inspected Wajima, Ishikawa, on Monday morning to check damage to houses in one of the most hard-hit cities.
It is necessary to supply housing and sanitary conditions as the (populations of the) quake-hit areas are graying, Mizote said.
The agency said the number of aftershocks reached 187 by 10 a.m. Monday, with their intensity varying from 1-4 on the Japanese scale.
Sunday's main quake logged an estimated magnitude of 6.9 and killed one person in Wajima. 
She was crushed by a stone lantern that collapsed in her garden after the earthquake.
The agency said it has named Sunday's main quake Noto Hanto Jishin (Noto Peninsula Earthquake), as the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture is the major affected area.
In Wajima, 60 people sustained injuries due to the quake. 
A total of 307 houses were flattened or damaged, leading some 2,600 people to evacuate to community centers and other shelters, the Wajima city government said.
Sotomi Mori, 81, slept the night at a community center in Wajima with her husband, 85, who is using an oxygen tank due to asthma.
We could not sleep at all because we were afraid of the aftershocks, Mori said. 
I want my husband to sleep in a safe place because I'm worried about his health.
An emergency relief team formed by firefighters from Ishikawa, Toyama, Fukui and Shiga prefectures searched to determine whether any people were buried under flattened houses in Wajima.
Water supplies were cut to around 5,500 households in Wajima.
Meanwhile, Ishikawa Prefecture resumed the operations of Noto airport in Wajima, which was closed since the Sunday's quake.
Egyptian security forces on Sunday seized at least 19 activists who were protesting against constitutional reform ahead of a public referendum.
Several members of the Egyptian national movement for change - Kefaya - and opposition leaders protested in front of the press syndicate in downtown Cairo, calling on the Egyptians to boycott the referendum due Monday on the amendments of 34 articles of the Egyptian constitution.
The banned Muslim Brotherhood movement and Kefaya held a number of protests nationwide. 
The Egyptian government had earlier warned critics of the constitutional referendum not to stage any protests on the day.
In a statement published in Cairo Wednesday, the Information Ministry said security forces would not tolerate any attempts to disrupt the referendum and democratic life on that day.
Some 35 million Egyptians have been called to cast their vote Monday at one of 30,000 polling stations. 
The referendum, which was originally scheduled for April, has been moved forward by Mubarak.
Citizens would no longer be protected from encroachments by the state, and opportunities for political participation would be limited further, according to critics.
In December 2006, President Hosny Mubarak asked the legislature to amend 34 articles of the constitution as part of a political reform package - the first major change in the constitution since 1971.
Critics of the reforms see the changes, which were drafted by Mubarak and his ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), as an attempt to finally turn (Egypt) into a police state.
The amendment of article 179, according to Amnesty International, would give sweeping powers of arrest to the police, grant broad authority to monitor private communications and allow the president to bypass ordinary courts and refer people suspected of terrorism to military and special courts, in which they would be unlikely to receive fair trials.
Opposition leaders and members of parliament have signalled their rejection of a proposed article that will result in the cancellation of judicial monitoring of the voting process in elections.
The opposition have also indicated their disapproval of a constitutional amendment regarding conditions for nominating presidential candidates and a third banning the formation of political parties based on religious denomination.
Amendments will also prevent independent candidates from standing for the presidency and ban all political activity based on religious convictions.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is seeking to end an uproar over his remarks on World War II sex slaves, on Monday apologised again to the so-called comfort women.
Abe has repeatedly said he stands by Japan's landmark 1993 apology to the thousands of former sex slaves, while saying he felt no need to make a fresh statement.
Schools should be required to record all incidents of bullying to encourage the problem to be tackled better, a committee of parliamentarians recommended on Tuesday.
The government should also commission research into the long term-effects of bullying on victims and offenders, as well as into effective ways of challenging bullying behaviour, the Commons Education and Skills Committee said in a report.
Head teachers are currently obliged to report to local education authorities only incidents of racism, with guidelines merely recommending they record cases of bullying.
The committee said as a result some schools avoided reporting bullying incidents because they wanted to avoid getting a bad reputation.
But the MPs said they were convinced a lack of accurate data had become a barrier to increasing the effectiveness of anti-bullying programmes.
The idea that bullying is in some way character-building and simply part of childhood is wrong and should be challenged, said committee chairman Barry Sheerman.
From pupils to ministers, all those involved in the lives of young people need to give the clear message that bullying, for whatever reason, is wrong, he added.
The committee heard evidence that victims of bullying can suffer problems ranging from general unhappiness, poor concentration, low-self esteem, psychosomatic symptoms and anxiety to depression, self-harm or even suicide.
The MPs also asked for teacher training programmes to include a focus on how to prevent and address bullying.
Schools should review their anti-bullying policies every three years and should give a higher profile to bullying in social health and citizenship classes.
The committee said it was concerned that some schools were excluding the victims of bullying on health and safety grounds.
It called on the government as a matter of urgency to issue new guidance to head teachers making it clear that exclusions should not be used to prevent victims of bullying from attending school.
Schools Minister Jim Knight questioned whether it was practicable to ask schools to keep detailed records on bullying.
Feedback from heads indicates that placing a duty on schools to measure and record every incident of bullying would be a huge bureaucratic burden, Knight said.
As the committee themselves note, defining what bullying is can be very difficult, he added.
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) echoed Knight's concerns, urging policymakers to think carefully before imposing further procedures and requirements on schools.
Interrogations of Saddam Hussein and seized documents confirmed the former Iraqi regime had no links with Al-Qaeda, a Pentagon report said Friday, contradicting the US case for the 2003 invasion.
A two-page resume of the report was published in February, but on Friday the Pentagon declassified the whole 120-page document.
According to the inspector general of the US Defense Department, information obtained after Saddam's fall confirmed the prewar position of the Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon intelligence that the Iraqi government had had no substantial contacts with Al-Qaeda.
This position was shored up by interrogations of Saddam, the former Iraqi president and other top officials captured by the US-led coalition forces in Iraq, the report said.
It contradicts a strong argument for the invasion made by the administration of President George W. Bush that Baghdad had a working relationship with Al-Qaeda.
The network, based in Afghanisation and led by Osama bin Laden, was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States in which almost 3,000 people were killed.
The report noted that the office of then-undersecretary of defense Douglas Feith, one of the foremost advocates for invading Iraq after the 2001 attacks, had ignored the CIA's position.
He characterized the supposed Al-Qaeda-Iraq relationship as mature and symbiotic in a September 2002 briefing to the chief of staff of Vice President Dick Cheney.
The Feith briefing alleged that the two cooperated in 10 areas, including training, financing and logistics.
But the new report says the US intelligence community had concluded at the time there were no conclusive signs of links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda, and that direct cooperation ... has not been established between the two.
Prior to the war there was little public dispute inside the United States over the Bush administration's assertions linking Iraq and bin Laden's group.
But since the invasion, a number of intelligence officials have alleged the White House and its backers ignored their intelligence and cherry picked information to support their arguments for a war.
Spanish soldiers working in a United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon have found an arms depot that included rocket launchers in a mountainous area in southern Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said Friday.
The soldiers found around 17 rocket launchers and also found a concrete foundation that could be used to launch the rockets at a location near the town of Rachaya al-Foukhar, the sources said.
The depot was camouflaged and the weapons were hidden in a sealed barrel, the sources added.
The arms were handed over to the Lebanese army, they said.
Spain has deployed nearly 1,100 troops in the beefed-up UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in accordance to UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended 33-days of Israeli war against the Hezbollah militant group.
The UNIFIL force monitors the fragile ceasefire at the Lebanese-Israeli border.
Hamas and Fatah activists clashed in the Gaza Strip on Friday and at least two militants and a young boy were injured, Palestinian security sources and local residents said.
Tensions are running high in Gaza despite the formation of a unity government on March 17 between the ruling Islamist Hamas movement and President Mahmoud Abbas's secular Fatah faction.
Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas said his cabinet would hold a special meeting on Saturday to discuss a new security plan aimed at stemming factional fighting and growing lawlessness within 100 days.
Haniyeh offered no details about the plan, drawn up by Interior Minister Hani al-Qawasmi.
Haniyeh accused the United States of fuelling the tensions by refusing to lift economic sanctions that prevent local, regional and international banks from transferring funds directly to the government.
The banks refused to deal with us and they are still refusing (to deal with the government) because of American gang-like actions, Haniyeh said.
Both sides said the fighting started when a Hamas member posted an Islamist pamphlet near a mosque loyal to Fatah.
In the West Bank city of Ramallah, an estimated 2,000 Hamas supporters rallied in support of Hamas leaders who have been killed by Israel.
At least three Palestinians have been killed in factional fighting in the Gaza Strip since the unity government was formed.
The Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- has demanded that the Palestinian government recognise Israel, renounce violence and accept interim peace agreements with Israel. 
The unity government's programme contains a promise to respect previous Israeli-Palestinian pacts but does not call for recognising Israel and says resistance against the Jewish state in all its forms is a legitimate right.
Haniyeh brushed aside U.S., Israeli and European demands that Hamas recognise Israel. 
The siege must be lifted, Haniyeh said.
Maoist guerrillas killed six people, including two paramilitary soldiers, in an ambush in eastern India, police said on Saturday.
The rebels opened fire and hurled grenades and bombs at a police station in the late night attack Friday in Bokaro district, 140 kilometers (87 miles), from Jharkhand state capital Ranchi.
Four civilians and two paramilitary personnel were killed. 
One soldier is missing, police official G.S Rath told AFP.
The exchange of gunfire between police and rebels lasted for more than four hours, the official said.
The Maoist insurgency began in the 1960s in India as an armed peasant movement.
The rebels who say they are fighting for the rights of landless farmers operate in 15 of India's 29 states.
Last month, they killed 55 policemen in neighbouring Chhattisgarh state in one of their biggest attacks.
An Iranian diplomat freed two months after being kidnapped in Iraq has said he was tortured by U.S. forces while in captivity, Iran's Fars News Agency reported on Saturday.
Iran has previously blamed the U.S. military for his abduction but U.S. officials have denied any role. 
On Saturday the U.S. military again denied playing any part in kidnapping the diplomat, or in his alleged torture.
The Iranian's comments follow the release of 15 British troops from Iran, where they say they were ill-treated.
Jalal Sharafi, in an interview with Fars, explained how he had been kidnapped and tortured severely by American forces with the help of (Iraqi) agents ... under the supervision of the CIA, Fars News Agency reported.
He showed reporters the marks left by torture on his body that are now being treated by doctors, said Fars, which is considered close to Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
Gunmen in Iraqi army uniforms kidnapped Sharafi in February. 
An Iraqi government official said at the time Sharafi had been seized by 30 gunmen wearing the uniforms of an Iraqi army unit that often works with the U.S. military in Iraq.
When Sharafi was released on Tuesday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said the diplomat was in good health and said he did not know who had held him.
U.S. military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Garver said in Baghdad, Multi-National Force Iraq was not involved in his kidnapping or any kind of claims of torture that he is now stating that he was subjected to.
U.S. forces in Iraq have arrested a number of Iranians, including five men detained in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil and who Washington said had links to Iran's Revolutionary Guards and were helping Iraqi militants.
Iran denies the charge, says they are diplomats and has demanded they be freed. 
It has also said it is still waiting for a reply to its request for consular access to the five. 
Washington says it is considering the request.
Iran, Britain and the United States insist there is no link between the release of the 15 British sailors and marines after 13 days' detention and the cases of Iranians held in Iraq.
Some analysts say the Revolutionary Guards who seized the 15 Britons may have been acting partly to send a message that Iran would not sit idle while its citizens were detained in Iraq.
While in captivity the Britons told Iranian television they were being treated well, but on return to Britain said they faced constant psychological pressure. 
Britain insists they were in Iraqi waters when seized.
Sharafi said he was abducted by agents with identification cards from Iraq's Defence Ministry and who were driving U.S. military cars. 
He said he was taken to a base near Baghdad Airport where he was questioned in Arabic and English, Fars reported.
Questions asked by CIA agents were about the presence and influence of Iran in Iraq. 
They asked questions about the amount of aid Iran provided to the government of (Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri) al-Maliki, Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurdish groups, he said.
When they were faced with my answers about the official relationship of Iran with the Iraqi government and officials they increased the tortures, many days they tortured me day and night, he said.
Fars quoted him as saying his interrogators also tried to encourage me to cooperate with them by showing a soft face.
Similar comments were carried by Iran's IRNA news agency.
Jendayi Frazer, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, met with leaders of war-torn Somalia's transitional government Saturday in the port city of Baidoa.
This was the first visit to Somalia by a senior US official in over a decade, US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in a statement issued in Washington. 
Her visit highlighted the US commitment at the highest levels to support the efforts of the Somali people to take advantage of their historic opportunity to achieve stability and security.
A NATO soldier was killed on Sunday in fighting in southern Afghanistan where foreign forces have launched a major offensive against the Taliban.
NATO said in a statement the soldier had been killed by a roadside bomb, but gave no further details.
A NATO spokeswoman refused to say where the incident occurred, saying that naming the province could reveal the nationality of the soldier.
About 5,000 NATO and Afghan troops are engaged in a major offensive, Operation Achilles, in Helmand province, the opium heartland of the world's biggest producer.
Last year saw the bloodiest fighting since the Taliban were ousted in 2001, mainly in the rebels' southern heartland of Helmand and neighbouring Kandahar province. 
British and Canadian troops make up the bulk of forces in the south. 
The Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press news agency reported that at least eight Taliban had been killed in fighting in Helmand.
A high-level US delegation led by former UN ambassador Bill Richardson arrived in North Korea on Sunday, official North and South Korean media said.
A US military plane landed at a Pyongyang airport, said South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
Bill Richardson, governor of New Mexico State, the US, and his party arrived here Sunday, Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency also said.
The trip by the US team -- on a mission to recover the remains of US soldiers killed in the Korean War -- came days ahead of a key deadline under a six-party deal to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear programme.
North Korea has to make good on its pledge to shut down its key nuclear facility in Yongbyon and allow the return of UN nuclear inspectors in return for 50,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil by April 14.
The pledge is part of an aid-for-disarmament deal reached on February 13 by the United States, China, the two Koreas, Russia and Japan.
Pyongyang had 60 days from that date to make good on its promises.
Washington announced Friday that a major obstacle to the six-party process had likely been overcome, with a mechanism found to unblock 25 million dollars in frozen North Korean funds.
North Korea has refused to return to the talks or fulfil its promises under the February deal until the money is returned.
The Al-Jazeera news channel broadcast a video recording Sunday of what it said was one of the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's regime still on the run.
The Qatar-based network gave no date for the purported footage of elite Republican Guards chief Saifeddin Fulayh Hassan Taha al-Rawi, who was number 14 on the most wanted list drawn up by the US military for the 2003 invasion.
Rawi, who carries a one million dollar US bounty on his head, was also jack of spades on the deck of cards of 55 most wanted supects distributed by the Pentagon at the outset of the invasion.
In the footage shown, Rawi accuses US forces of using neutron and phosphorus bombs during their assault on Baghdad airport ahead of the capture of the Iraqi capital.
His face is difficult to identify due to low light, but he is seen sitting in what appears to be a living room wearing a black and white kefiya, the traditional Arab headdress.
The enemy used neutron and phosporus weapons against Baghdad airport... there were bodies burnt to their bones, he says, adding that elite Iraqi soldiers fought until they were martyred.
The channel said that the clip was an excerpt from a longer interview, more of which it would air later.
At least 20 people are missing after a cargo vessel sank following a collision with another ship off eastern China on Sunday, Chinese state media said.
The 6,500-ton cargo ship Harvest was en route from Shanghai to Vietnam when it collided with the Chinese cargo ship Jinhaikun in Taizhou Bay at 4:00 a.m on Sunday, the official Xinhua news agency said.
All 20 crew from the sunken vessel were missing - 19 Chinese and one Indonesian. 
The ship was registered outside China, the agency said without specifying the country of origin.
The 17,061-ton Chinese vessel was from the eastern coastal city of Fuzhou and heading for the port of Zhangjiagang in the Yangtze delta, it said.
The smaller ship sank immediately after the collision, prompting the coastguard and navy to mount a full-scale search and rescue operation off China's Zhejiang province.
Maritime police were investigating the cause of the collision, the agency said.
Slovenian Martin Strel, after braving crocodiles, piranhas, disease and the threat of an imminent heart attack, on Sunday completed a record-setting 66-day, 3,274-mile (5,268 km) swim down the Amazon River and was taken to a hospital.
Thousands of people were on hand in the Brazilian colonial city of Belem as an exhausted Strel, 52, made his final stroke, and was pulled from the water.
On Saturday, Strel had officially set a Guinness Book of World Records mark when he hit the 3,274-mile point, the swimmer's support team said on his Web site.
After arriving in Belem, Strel was placed in an ambulance and medics worked to stabilize his blood pressure, which was at near-heart attack levels, his support team said on the Web site.
Strel has been suffering from nausea, diarrhea, dangerously high blood pressure, sunstroke, dizziness and delirium.
Due to his deteriorating health, Strel had been swimming six hours and then resting for six hours in his final leg down the world's most voluminous and second longest river.
On Friday, Strel had to be hauled from the water by his son Borut and others and had difficulty standing. 
His doctor ordered him not to swim but Strel, obsessed with reaching Belem, insisted on swimming the final few miles at night to avoid the blistering sun.
I just want to finish and go home, he said on his Web site.
Nicknamed fish man, Strel started his latest big-river swim on Feb. 1 at the Peruvian jungle town of Atalaya, where buckets of animal blood had to be poured into the river to distract piranha from making a quick meal of the swimmer.
Strel formally finish his marathon swim down the Amazon four days ahead of schedule on Saturday.
In the last leg of his journey, Strel said the ocean tides coming up river were driving him backward at times.
Along the trip, Strel and his team had several near misses with pirate attacks and often had to steer toward swift flowing currents to avoid being set upon by piranha. 
This resulted in Strel being swept away in a giant whirlpool once and separated from his team and boat another time.
The team was constantly at risk of parasites and disease in the Amazon such as malaria and yellow fever.
I think the animals have just accepted me. 
I've been swimming with them for such a long time that they must think I'm one of them now, Strel said recently on the BBC.
Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said on Thursday Britain does not intend to send any more troops to Iraq.
U.S. President George W. Bush said on Wednesday night that he is sending 21,500 extra troops to Iraq which he believes are needed to help break the cycle of violence.
Asked about Britain's plans, Beckett told reporters It is not our intention to send more troops at the present.
A senior Russian army commander said Thursday that the planned deployment by Washington of Patriot missiles and an aircraft carrier in the Middle East was aimed against Iran.
It's not difficult to understand what country these military forces and equipment are expected to engage with...obviously against Iran, said General Vladimir Shamanov, a top aide to Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov.
On Wednesday, President George W. Bush unveiled plans to increase the number of US troops in Iraq, as well as to deploy anti-missile Patriot missiles and an aircraft carrier in the region.
Russia has supplied Iran with Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile systems, which are intended for the defence of government and military installations. Moscow is also helping to build Iran's first nuclear reactor.
Bangladeshi President Iajuddin Ahmed Thursday declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew in the country ahead of disputed elections on January 22, state television reported.
One person was killed and dozens were injured Thursday as coca farmers and middle class youths clashed in the streets of Cochabamba over plans by the local governor for regional autonomy.
As rival protesters beat each other with sticks and stones, police responded with tear gas to disperse the unruly demonstrators after failing to keep the two groups apart.
The coca farmers, all supporters of leftist President Evo Morales and his controversial reform program, were calling for the resignation of the Cochabamba region's governor, Manfred Reyes, for proposing a referendum on state autonomy to counter the central government's expanding authority.
Young people mostly of middle-class background held a counter-demonstration in support of the governor and against the socialist policies of the Morales administration.
The city of a half million people has been paralyzed since Monday by protesting farmers who have cut all road access to the city and have staged daily demonstrations.
The unrest followed similar clashes Monday between thousands of coca farmers and the police that left 31 people injured, including 10 journalists, in this city 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of La Paz.
Bolivia has been increasingly divided between the poor, mostly indigenous highlands and the wealthy lowlands since Morales, 55, a one-time legislator on behalf of coca-growing districts and the country's first native Indian president, took power a year ago with an ambitious socialist agenda.
The four wealthy, eastern lowland provinces of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando and Tarija have laid claim to greater autonomy in the wake of Morales's moves to redistribute land holdings among poorer Bolivians and rewrite the constitution.
Cochabamba leaders recently joined the autonomy movement.
The Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Professor Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu voiced serious concern over the recent escalation of military conflict in Somalia, particularly the air strikes in the south of the country, which has reportedly resulted in the loss of innocent lives and widespread damage to property. 
He also announced plans to shortly dispatching a high-level OIC mission to visit Somalia and its neighboring countries as part of the peace mission.
In a press statement, the OIC chief cautioned that this unnecessary military action could seriously undermine the progress achieved so far for the attainment of lasting peace, stability and reconciliation in the country and had the potential to engulf the entire region and even beyond. 
Prof. Ihsanoglu strongly appealed to all Somalis, particularly the leaders of different factions, to work for the stability of their country as well as to cease hostilities and to sincerely strive towards genuine national reconciliation. 
He also made an appeal to all neighboring countries of Somalia and global powers to immediately end their military intervention in the country.
The OIC secretary general urged the United Nations and the international community to play an effective role in expeditiously stabilizing the extremely volatile situation in Somalia. 
The General Secretariat continues to closely follow the developments in Somalia and to work with the international community to achieve peace, normalcy and national reconciliation in the country, statement added.  
A Argentine judge on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for former President Maria Estela Martinez de Peron, the leader more commonly known as Isabel Peron, for the disappearance of a student activist in the 1970s.
Judge Hector Acosta issued the warrant against the widow of legendary former President Juan Peron in San Rafael in the western province of Mendoza. 
He said she must be held accountable for the disappearance of Hector Aldo Fagetti Gallego in 1976.
The judge said the man vanished after Peron allegedly signed an order to her military to rid the country of subversive elements.
Peron, who now lives in Madrid, took over as president after the death of her husband. 
Her government was overthrown by a coup in 1976.
Another federal judge is investigating her involvement with the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance, a right-wing death squad known as the Triple A.
The group was founded by a government minister during Peron's time as president, and is allegedly responsible for the deaths of 1,500 people.
At least seven people including a senior judge were shot dead in the Pakistani city of Lahore Friday in what appeared to be an attack by political rivals in the central Punjab province, news reports said.
Additional Advocate General Arif Bhinder was travelling with a police escort when gunmen in two vehicles ambushed the convoy in the provincial capital, the private Geo TV channel reported.
The attack on a busy road in the city centre left at least seven people dead and more than 10 others injured, police said. 
One of the assailants and three security personnel were among those killed in the exchange of fire.
Tensions grew as hundreds of locals including relatives of the victims gathered outside the hospital where the injured were taken for treatment. 
The death toll could increase as four of the victims were believed to be in a critical condition, Geo said.
Communist-run Vietnam plans to privatise more than 100 state-owned firms this year and next, including the oil and gas industries, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said on Friday.
Speaking on the sidelines of a regional summit in the Philippines, Dung also told Reuters that Vietnam, which became an official member of the World Trade Organisation on Thursday, would boost transparency to attract more foreign investment.
That's our plan in 2007 and 2008, to privatise or equitise all these 104 companies, including Vietnam Airlines and the oil and gas industries.
Vietnam will also boost its openness and transparency as the other members of WTO and as regulated by the WTO.
Air attacks against fugitive Islamists in south Somalia in recent days have mistakenly targeted nomadic herdsmen gathering round fires, killing 70, British-based aid agency Oxfam said on Friday.
Under international law, there is a duty to distinguish between military and civilian targets, Oxfam added, citing its local partner organisations in Somalia for the information.
Washington sent a warplane into Somalia on Monday to try and take out what U.S. officials say are top al Qaeda suspects hiding with the Islamists.
Ethiopia, which helped the interim government of Somalia oust rival Islamists from Mogadishu over the New Year, has also been carrying out air raids against the retreating fighters.
While some Somali sources have reported scores of deaths, there has been no independent confirmation on the ground.
Oxfam is receiving reports from its partner organisations in Somalia that nomadic herdsmen have been mistakenly targeted in recent bombing raids, Oxfam said in a statement released in Nairobi.
According to the reports from local organisations in Afmadow district, bombs have hit vital water sources as well as large groups of nomads and their animals who had gathered round large fires at night to ward off mosquitoes.
Further reports have also confirmed that bombings have claimed the lives of 70 people in the district.
Since the open warfare started in late December, some 70,000 Somalis have fled their homes, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation, Oxfam said.
An Indian traffic policeman has been transferred for not realising that celebrities are sometimes above the law and trying to fine one of the country's biggest cricket stars, newspapers reported on Friday.
Inspector Saifuddin Ahmed thought he was just doing his job when he stopped an expensive sports car in the eastern city of Ranchi for having dark tinted windows -- an offence in India.
But sitting behind those windows was cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni, one of India's hottest celebrities and a hero in his home state of Jharkhand, of which Ranchi is the capital.
Early reports said an unfazed Ahmed insisted Dhoni hand over the 900-rupee fine ($20).
Local police have since backpedalled, saying Dhoni was allowed to drive on after waving a letter from local authorities giving him special dispensation to break the law.
Ahmed has now been transferred in what is an apparent demotion from the downtown commercial district to a downmarket residential bazaar, the Hindustan Times reported on Friday.
The state's chief minister was reported as saying that celebrities should expect special treatment when it comes to the law, a widely held notion in India's upper echelons.
The police should be liberal while dealing with persons of his stature, Madhu Koda was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
What is the harm if a person of his standing uses a car with tinted glass windows
A suicide attacker rammed a bomb-filled minivan into a vehicle carrying foreigners south of the Afghan capital Friday, wounding a US national and two Afghan civilians, police said.
The blast was in the Logar province about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the capital, the city's criminal investigation chief Ali Shah Paktiawal told AFP from the site.
Paktiawal said the targeted vehicle was not a military car and the wounded American was not a soldier.
The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the car belonged to US civilian contractors. 
ISAF said the explosion was not a suicide attack but an AFP photographer at the scene saw the body of the man police said was the suicide attacker. 
The targeted car was burning, the photographer said.
Taliban militants waging an insurgency against the US-backed government ramped up their use of suicide bombings in Afghanistan last year as part of an increasingly deadly guerrilla-like campaign.
ISAF has said there were about 117 suicide bombings in 2006. 
Although most were targeted at military forces, they killed about 200 civilians and nearly 70 Afghan and foreign soldiers, according to ISAF records.
East Timor's police chief and his two deputies have resigned but no reason was given, the interior minister of the troubled nation said Friday.
Interior Minister Alcino Barris said police commissioner Paulo Fatima Martins would however continue to work in the East Timor National Police (PNTL) force.
(Martins) resigned as general commissioner but will still be working as a superintendent, Barris told reporters.
Deputy police chiefs Ismail Babo and Nuno Saldanha also resigned their posts but remained as inspectors.
Even though they submitted resignation letters, they are still members of the police force and will still receive their salaries, Barris explained.
The minister said he had no candidates lined up to replace the three.
East Timor's police force was pulled from the streets following violence in April and May last year after clashes between security force factions which quickly degenerated into street violence.
A commission has been reevaluating all police officers to see whether they should resume duty or face disciplinary or judicial action in relation to the deadly violence.
This is a gentlemanly act from a PNTL leader. 
He sacrificed his position to support the restructuring within the PNTL, Aniceto Neves from the National University of Timor Leste told AFP. 
(His) resignation made the evaluation process easier, he said. 
The unrest last year led to the deaths of at least 37 people and forced about 15 percent of East Timor's population to flee their homes.
Stability has largely returned to the fledgling nation following the arrival of foreign peacekeepers and UN police and the installation of a new government in July headed by Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
New York senator and 2008 presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton is to visit Iraq and Afghanistan this weekend to meet government officials and US military leaders, her office said Friday.
The former first lady, who voted for the Iraq war in 2002 but has since turned into a vocal critic of the campaign, was traveling with fellow Democratic Senator Evan Bayh and Republican Congressman John McHugh.
Our nation continues to face serious and growing challenges in both Iraq and Afghanistan. 
At this critical juncture, I am eager to express my gratitude to our troops on the ground, Clinton said in a statement ahead of the visit.
I am eager as well to hear from our commanders on the ground a frank assessment of our missions in those countries.
I am also looking forward to meeting Iraqi leaders and American civilian officials to hear their view on the current situation in Iraq, she said.
Clinton summarily came out against President George W. Bush's proposals announced this week to send some 20,000 more US troops into Iraq, describing the plan as a proposed escalation of the war in Iraq.
The president's Iraq policy has been marred by incompetence and arrogance as his administration has refused to recognize the military and political reality on the ground, she said.
US President George W. Bush on Friday discussed his new Iraq plan and Middle East peace efforts with Jordan's King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the White House said.
The leaders discussed Bush's push to increase US troop levels in Iraq, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's upcoming trip to the region, and efforts to make progress on the so-called road map to Middle East peace, said national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe.
Two Israeli soldiers whose capture in July by guerrillas from the Lebanese movement Hezbollah sparked a 34-day war, are still alive, a former Lebanese president was quoted Friday as saying.
Amin Gemayel was approached by a reporter from the Israeli daily Maariv on the sidelines of a conference in Madrid on the Middle East peace process and asked to make a statement on the fate of the two men.
Maariv said that Roger Eddeh, a Lebanese delegation member, replied: They are alive, and that Gemayel confirmed the statement.
Asked if there was a reasonable chance the two soldiers would return home alive and unharmed, Gemayel said: We all hope that this will indeed happen.
It was not clear how Gemayel, who belongs to a political faction at odds with Hezbollah, would be privy to information about the fate of the soldiers.
Gemayel was president of Lebanon from 1982 to 1988.
The fate of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who were captured in a cross-border raid on July 12, has been the subject of much speculation.
Last month, Israeli military officials said the two had been seriously wounded in the attack, in which three soldiers were killed, and that one of them was in critical condition.
A few days earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had told parliament he did not know if the soldiers were alive.
Twenty-two Muslim pilgrims leaving Saudi Arabia by bus were killed in a road crash near the border with the United Arab Emirates, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Friday.
It said those killed and the 24 injured were from Syria, Egypt, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan.
Some 2.5 million Muslims finished performing the annual haj pilgrimage earlier this month in Saudi Arabia.
Thousands of Hamas supporters poured into the streets of the Gaza Strip after Friday prayers to denounce one of Fatah's most powerful leaders, ratcheting up tensions between the rival Palestinian factions.
Both the ruling Hamas movement and once-dominant Fatah have mounted large rallies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank in recent days, trying to whip up public support and project strength amid the mounting internal violence.
Hamas supporters emerged from mosques on Friday waving green Hamas flags and chanted slogans accusing Mohammad Dahlan, a Fatah strongman and possible successor to President Mahmoud Abbas, of being the mastermind of a coup against its nine-month-old government.
Dahlan is a traitor, they chanted.
Hamas accused Dahlan in December of masterminding a plot to kill Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas, a charge Dahlan denied.
Tawfiq Abu Khoussa, a Fatah spokesman, accused Hamas of trying to spark more fighting. 
We urge Hamas to return to its senses before it is too late, he said. 
At least 30 Palestinians have been killed in factional fighting since Abbas called last month for early elections to try to break a deadlock with Hamas.
The Islamic militant group, whose charter calls for Israel's destruction, took control of the Palestinian government in March after beating Fatah in parliamentary elections.
Three Palestinians were injured in fighting on Friday between the rival groups.
Listen Dahlan, our ideal is the Prophet Mohammad and not Olmert and Bush, Hamas supporters chanted, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and U.S. President George W. Bush. Listen Dahlan, our choice is Jihad. It is not treason.
Dahlan has close ties to Washington and is expected to be among the Palestinian officials to meet U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit to the region, starting on Saturday.
At least three members of Ivory Coast's security forces were shot dead in an attack on check points close to the border with Ghana early on Friday, military and local council sources said.
A local council worker in the town of Aboisso, close to the border, told Reuters two military police officers and a customs officer were killed. 
Another seven security forces had been injured, four of them seriously, he said.
He said the attack appeared to be an act of banditry rather than politically motivated. 
The West African state has been divided into a rebel-held north and government south since a brief 2002-03 civil war that began after a failed coup.
I confirm there were at least three killed in the attack this morning at the border with Ghana, a military official at the army headquarters in the main city Abidjan said.
Our forces are leading (search) operations in the area even if the situation is now under control, he told Reuters.
The former French colony had closed its land border with Ghana temporarily for investigations to be carried out, another senior military official and the French embassy said.
One gendarme posted near to the border said two attackers had been arrested. 
He said the attacks had targeted the main border post with Ghana and a smaller check point several km (miles) inland.
Ivory Coast's border with Ghana has been the scene of violent attacks in the past.
A mob of villagers attacked a check point near Aboisso in November with clubs and machetes, angry the police presence was preventing local cocoa growers smuggling their beans to Ghana where they sell for higher prices.
The villagers, some of them armed with 12-bore shotguns they use to hunt small birds and animals in the bush, burned the border post down.
The nine South Koreans and one Nigerian taken hostage by armed men in southern Nigeria were released late Friday afternoon, a government spokesman for the southern state of Bayelsa told AFP.
They released all 10 of the hostages. 
He added the men are in Warri, in neighbouring Delta state, and currently the nearest town with a functioning airport.
Company officials are there to collect them, he said.
The men are employed by Daewoo and were subcontracted to build a pipeline for Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell. 
They were taken hostage early on Wednesday morning by an armed group that so far remains unidentified.
All are in good health. 
No ransom was paid, the spokesman, Welson Ekiyor said.
Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson has been indicted for drug possession and driving under the influence of drugs by an Arizona grand jury, authorities said on Friday.
Tyson, 40, faces two counts each of felony drug possession and misdemeanor driving under the influence in connection with his Dec. 29 arrest in Scottsdale, Arizona, Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said. 
Thomas said he was seeking prison time for the former boxer, who has a long record of legal troubles. 
If convicted, Tyson faces more than seven years' imprisonment.
The embattled fighter was taken into custody after nearly colliding his black BMW into a sheriff's car after leaving a nightclub, according to court documents.
He was found with cocaine on him and in his vehicle, police said. 
In court documents, the arresting officer said Tyson admitted to using cocaine that day and revealed he was addicted to the illegal drug.
Tyson attorney Tom Marlowe could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.
Tyson served three years in an Indiana prison following a 1992 rape conviction and was sentenced in 1999 to a year in prison after pleading no contest to two misdemeanor assault charges in Maryland. He was released after 3 1/3 months.
US President George W. Bush has vowed he will go ahead with plans to send an extra 21,500 troops into Iraq even if the opposition-controlled Congress tries to stop him, CBS television said Friday.
Bush, who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, has told the US channel in an interview on a 60 Minutes program to be aired Sunday that he will override Congress's objections to the strategy aimed at ending the violence in Iraq.
Asked by 60 Minutes if he had the authority to press ahead without congressional backing, Bush says: I think in this situation I do and I fully understand (Congress) could try to stop me from doing it.
But I made my decision, we're going forward.
Bush has faced a barrage of criticism since he unveiled his new strategy to end the violence which has killed more than 3,000 US troops in Iraq.
A rocket hit the US embassy in Athens on Friday, in an attack claimed by a left-wing group that raised fears of a resurgence of extremist violence in Greece.
The rocket damaged the building, but there were no casualties.
Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras said the authorities were investigating the credibilty of call from the Revolutionary Struggle organisation assuming responsibility.
The radical left wing outfit has staged other operations in recent years which have made it the most feared extremist group in Greece.
A police source said investigators found the remains of a Russian-made anti-tank rocket at the embassy, which is on one of Athens' busiest highways.
I'm treating (this) as a very serious attack, US ambassador Charles Ries told reporters outside the modern glass-fronted building.
We did not expect anything, but the embassy is always guarded carefully, said Ries, who added that he was confident that the effort to damage the strong relations between the United States and Greece will not succeed.
Both the embassy and the US consulate in the northern city of Salonika were closed for security reasons.
US institutions, banks and companies have been frequently targeted by  militant groups in Greece in recent decades. 
A CIA station chief was assassinated in Athens in 1975.
Polydoras said Friday's strike constituted an attempt to revive terrorist (activity) but he predicted it would fail.
It is probably domestic activity ... as is seen from the apparent assumption of responsibility by Revolutionary Struggle, he said.
Police said the rocket penetrated the building near the front-entrance emblem and exploded inside, damaging a toilet on the third floor, which also houses the ambassador's office.
The missile was fired at 5:58 am (0358 GMT) and caused minor damage to the front windows and the roof.
All evidence points to the rocket having been fired from an adjacent worksite lot, where a building was recently demolished, a senior police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Several windows were smashed around the eagle emblem on the facade and there were burn marks on the adjacent wall.
US embassy officials waited at least 15 minutes after the blast before allowing Greek police access to the courtyard, and over an hour before letting them into the building proper, a police source said.
Revolutionary Struggle is believed to have carried out six attacks in recent years, including a May 30 explosion near the home of Polydoras' predecessor as public order minister, George Voulgarakis.
Previous attacks included one on a police station 100 days before the 2004 Athens Olympics and another in December 2005 against the economy ministry in central Athens.
Friday's incident is one of the most serious since the 2002 break-up of the November 17.
Group which carried out several attacks against foreign diplomats and military personnel, including the assassination of the CIA station chief.
A night-time swoop by US forces on an Iranian office in northern Iraq triggered strong criticism Friday, with Kurdish leaders and even Moscow branding the raid unacceptable.
In the early hours of Thursday, US troops dropped from helicopters stormed an Iranian liaison office in Iraqi Kurdistan and detained six Iranian employees.
The raid came on the heels of a warning by US President George W. Bush that the United States would crack down on Iranian meddling in Iraq, where US commanders believe Tehran's agents arm militias and incite anti-US attacks.
The US military later said it had freed one of the six people detained in the controversial raid on the Iranian government building in Arbil, the capital of the northern Iraqi Kurdistan region.
Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said the office had not yet become a full-fledged consulate, indicating that the raid had not violated any diplomatic protocols as had initially been claimed in Tehran.
It is a liaison office. 
There was a request to change it into consulate, Zebari told AFP, adding that the office had been operational for 10 years.
We had already agreed with the Iranians to open consulates in Arbil and Sulaimaniyah in return for opening (Iraqi) consulates in (Iranian cities) Mashhad and Ahwaz. 
These procedures have not been finalised, he said.
Asked about the remaining five detainees Zebari said: They are not with us. 
They are with the Americans.
We contacted the US embassy and submitted all the information available to us on the nature of their work and the place of their work. 
They have been working under the approval of the government, he said.
The US military confirmed that the five employees were in its custody.
In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the Arbil office was targeted because there was information that we had that the individuals there were associated with attacks against multinational forces, against Iraqi forces.
Certainly there's also been information linking this facility to Revolutionary Guard and other Iranian elements ... that are fomenting violence in Iraq, he said.
The claim that this was somehow an innocent diplomatic facility seems to ring hollow in light of that, he said.
Describing the operation, Kurdish witnesses said US soldiers surrounded the building, just 100 metres (yards) from the Kurdistan administration in downtown Arbil, dropped off by helicopters and two Humvee military vehicles.
The commandos threw stun grenades in a show of force.
There were no clashes with security guards but US grenades shattered windows of the two-storey building as troops ordered all those inside to surrender before lowering the Iranian flag and abandoning the premises. 
Fuad Hussein, a senior official in the Kurdish presidency, said the regional government, one of the staunchest US allies in the Middle East, had not been given advance warning about the arrest operation.
Pakistan on Friday rejected claims that the Al-Qaeda terror network is strengthening and building worldwide connections from safe havens in the South Asian country.
Top US spy John Negroponte told the US Senate on Thursday that Pakistan contained crucial sanctuaries for Al-Qaeda, the terrorist organization that poses the greatest threat to the United States.
We have captured or killed numerous senior Al-Qaeda operatives, but Al-Qaeda's core elements are resilient, said Negroponte, the director of national intelligence (DNI).
The terrorists are cultivating stronger operational connections and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders' secure hideout in Pakistan to affiliates throughout the Middle East, North Africa and Europe, he said.
Pakistan's foreign ministry described the comments as questionable criticism and urged Negroponte to acknowledge the country's role in breaking the back of Al-Qaeda, responsible for the September 11 attacks in 2001.
The ministry said Pakistan had done more than any other country to fight terrorism, a feat that had been recognised by the White House and the international community. 
Pakistan remains committed to fighting international terrorism and extremism. 
In this endeavour, the focus must always remain on cooperation instead of questionable criticism, the ministry said in a statement.
Negroponte said Pakistan is a frontline partner in the war on terror that has captured several Al-Qaeda leaders.
Many of our most important interests intersect in Pakistan, where the Taliban and Al-Qaeda maintain critical sanctuaries, Negroponte said.
He made the comments to the Senate Select Intelligence Committee as part of his office's annual threat assessment.
Pakistan said although Al-Qaeda elements were active in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe, it would be incorrect to link them to any remnants of Al-Qaeda in Pakistan.
When Mr. Negroponte mentions the capture and killing of hundreds of Al-Qaeda members since 9/11, he should acknowledge the efforts of the country that made this possible, the foreign ministry statement said.
Pakistan would continue to pursue Al-Qaeda remnants as well as other terrorists and extremist elements, the statement said.
We are addressing this challenge first and foremost in the interest of our security and peace and development of our society, it went on.
Pakistan says it has arrested more than 700 Al-Qaeda operatives but consistently denies claims that Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden is hiding in its rugged tribal territory bordering Afghanistan.
The statement singled out comments from the head of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan on Thursday that Pakistan's help was crucial in the fight against a deadly insurgency in the neighbouring war-ravaged nation.
Pakistan has deployed around 80,000 troops to hunt down Al-Qaeda fugitives who sneaked across the border from Afghanistan after the ouster of the fundamentalist Taliban regime there in late 2001.
Around 60,000 people have been displaced in Sri Lanka by flooding caused by torrential monsoon rains, the government said on Saturday, while the death toll from landslides a day earlier rose to 13.
Sri Lanka's central tea-growing hills are prone to landslides during the monsoon, particularly in the district of Nuwara Eliya renowned for its lush plantations, where the deaths occurred on Friday.
A total of 12,500 families have been affected due to the floods and landslides, Major-General Gamini Hettiarrachchi, head of the National Disaster Management Centre, told Reuters. 
That is about 60,000 people.
The southeastern disitrict of Hambantota, which was pounded by the 2004 tsunami, was badly affected.
Hundreds of houses were damaged and thousands of people remain stranded in the central hills, said the government, which is temporarily housing the displaced in schools and welfare centres.
Japanese actor Shingo Mukai, who went missing in the port city of Cartagena on January 5, was found dead last week and buried by the Colombian city because it could not identify him, the mayor said Friday.
Mukai, 31, was discovered in the mouth of a river in the Caribbean city with his neck broken on January 6, said Cartagena Mayor Nicolas Curi.
Because he had no documents and the body was decomposing, he was quickly buried, Curi said.
The mayor said he was told that Mukai disappeared January 5 after bolting out of a taxi in a panic attack while two companions were paying the driver, who had taken them back from a party outside Cartagena.
The man asked to be let out or that he would jump out, Curi said. 
So the cab driver stopped and the man ran away.
Forensics experts were waiting for dental records from the Japanese embassy in Bogota to confirm Mukai's identity.
The United States should not withdraw troops from Iraq even if its plan to send in 20,000 extra forces to stabilize the country fails, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday.
In a second day of grilling before a skeptical US Congress, Gates acknowledged the new plan unveiled by President George W. Bush on Wednesday sets no timetable for disarming Shiite and Sunni militias behind the mounting sectarian violence.
If we talk about the consequences of the American failure and defeat in Iraq, then saying, 'If you don't do this, we'll leave, and we'll leave now,' does not strike me as being in the national interests of the United States, he said.
So the question will be: What different kind of strategy might we be able to come up with that would have some prospect of avoiding a failure or a defeat in Iraq?
Democrats, who now control Congress, have called for a withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in four to six months time -- a proposal Gates rejected as little more than an invitation to the insurgents to wait it out.
I think it is highly likely that there would be a significant increase in sectarian violence in Iraq, that the government would probably begin to come apart, that the army might come apart, and that you would probably have outside elements, he said.
A senior US military official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said Thursday the Iraqis have lifted restrictions on deliberate targeting of certain protected extremists leaders.
They also dropped restrictions on military operations in certain areas of the city such as Sadr City, the stronghold of radical cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr and his Jaish Al-Mahdi (JAM) militia.
But the official said US forces were unlikely to go head to head against militias, unless attacked. There is not a military solution for the JAM, he said.
A group of Iranians detained by US forces in Iraq in a new effort to counter Tehran's alleged support for violent attacks had links to Iran's Revolutionary Guards, a senior US official said Friday.
Six Iranians were nabbed in a night-time swoop by US forces on an office in the northern Iraq city of Arbil early Thursday, prompting protests from Iran and strong criticism from other governments.
State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the Arbil office was targeted because there was information that we had that the individuals there were associated with attacks against multinational forces, against Iraqi forces, he said.
Certainly there's also been information linking this facility to Revolutionary Guard and other Iranian elements ... that are fomenting violence in Iraq, he said.
Casey confirmed that one of the six people detained had been released and the other five were still in custody of US forces, who are continuing to investigate the incident.
Earlier Friday State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said none of the detained Iranians held diplomatic passports and that the Arbil office had no diplomatic status.
It was a building that the Iranians were using, occupying, it was Iraqi territory, he said.
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan on Friday reaffirmed Turkey's right to send troops into Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels there and chided U.S. officials for questioning it.
The Turkish Republic will do whatever is necessary to combat the terrorists when the time comes, but it will not announce its plans in advance, Erdogan told a news conference after a meeting of his ruling AK Party.
We say we are ready to take concrete steps with the Iraqi government and we also say these steps must be taken now.
In sharp language underscoring Turkish anxiety about the chaos in Iraq, Erdogan said it was wrong for Washington -- our supposed strategic ally -- to tell Turkey, with its historic and cultural ties in the region, to stay out of Iraq.
We have a 350 km border with Iraq. 
We have historic relations ... the United States is 10,000 km away from Iraq, and yet is it not intervening in Iraq's internal affairs? he said. 
Ankara has long complained that the United States and Iraqi government have failed to crack down on Kurdish rebels, and periodically asserts its right under international law to conduct cross-border operations against the guerrillas.
More than 30,000 people have been killed since the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), branded a terrorist organisation by the EU and the U.S. as well as Ankara, launched an armed struggle for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984. 
Up to 5,000 militants are believed to be hiding in the mountains of northern Iraq from where they have staged attacks on military and civilian targets inside Turkey.
We don't want to waste time with abstract statements, we want concrete results, said Erdogan, who has said the Iraq situation is now a bigger foreign policy priority for Turkey even than its bid to join the European Union.
Ankara's biggest nightmare is a violent breakup of Iraq and the emergence of a Kurdish state in the north that could in turn foment separatism among Turkey's own Kurds.
US Senator Hillary Clinton said Saturday during a visit to Iraq that she doubted the United States or Iraqi government can pacify the country.
I don't know that the American people or the Congress at this point believe this mission can work, she told ABC news.
And in the absence of a commitment that is backed up by actions from the Iraqi government, why should we believe it?
She spoke after meetings with top US commanders General George Casey and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno.
I'm skeptical that the Iraqi government will do what they have promised to do, and that I think is the concern of all of us who have heard this before, she told the US broadcaster.
Clinton said that the level of security during this trip was far greater than on her prior visits.
This is heartbreaking, she said. 
This is my third trip here. 
I've seen the violence and security problems increase, not decrease.
The first time I was here. 
We were not asked to wear body armor and put on helmets. 
We were not shepherded very narrowly from place to place. 
I went to Kirkuk the first time when actually General Odierno was there, she said.
We went into the city.
We had a meeting in the town hall with people.
US President George W. Bush, under great political pressure to implement a new strategy in the nearly four-year-old war, has pledged to send an additional 21,500 troops, a move opposed by as many as two out of three Americans, including Clinton, who would draw down troops.
That would really demonstrate to the Iraqis that we don't have an open-ended commitment, Clinton said. We are not going to be here providing protection for their leaders, which we do.
Protesters, demanding a new parliamentary election, blocked roads and streets by burning tires and cars.
The opposition, however, began removing roadblocks across the country Tuesday night after halting the protests, Reuters news agency quoted a senior opposition source as saying.
In the interview, Siniora denounced the protests as an undemocratic way of expressing one's opinion.
If they say they have the majority of people supporting them, then they shouldn't resort to such an action, he said.
Siniora reiterated his offer to meet some of the opposition demands to expand the Cabinet to include the opposition's representatives, but rejected their demand for veto power over ministerial decisions.
Siniora, who postponed a planned visit to Japan last November over the resignation of Shiite ministers from his government, said he expects to make the trip in spring with the aim of enhancing bilateral relations.
Japan plays a large role in the Mideast, and we are major trading partners, he noted.
A NATO delegation met with Pakistani defence authorities in the city of Rawalpindi on Wednesday to discuss greater cooperation and the aftermath of a coalition forces air strike that accidentally killed a Pakistani soldier.
Pakistani Defence Secretary Tariq Waseem Ghazi raised concern over Monday's provocative act that could jeopardize the partnership between the sides, according to a ministry statement
Baldwin De Vidts, head of the NATO legal office, expressed condolences for the casualties and hope that such incidents would not happen again.
One Pakistani soldier died and two others were wounded when US aircraft aimed four bombs at suspected insurgents in the Shawal area close to the border with Afghanistan.
Vidts said Pakistan's logistical support was very essential for the NATO forces fighting the Taliban insurgency in neighbouring Afghanistan.
The recent aerial attack increased tensions between Islamabad and the international forces, which have questioned the Pakistani military's efforts to check cross-border movement of Taliban and other fighters.
Israeli troops stationed on the borders between Israel and the central Gaza Strip shot dead a Palestinian teenager Wednesday, Palestinian medical and security officials and the Israeli army said.
The teenager was crawling towards the border fence when he was shot. 
Two other Palestinians were wounded and arrested, they said.
An Israeli military spokeswoman said the soldiers had noticed the three figures some hours after midnight.
She said troops called on them to halt, fired warning shots in the air, and opened fire on them as they continued to crawl toward the fence.
Palestinian security officials said the three were shot when they were apporaching a garbage dump outside Dir al-Balach.
Gunmen shot dead an Iraqi university professor in Mashatel street in the Azamiyah district of northern Baghdad, al-Iraqiyah State TV reported Wednesday.
Dr Diyaa al-Maqwartar, who was teaching at Baghdad's Mustansiriya university, was shot in the head and chest, the report added.
The killing came a week after at least 70 people were killed and 110 others were wounded in two suicide bombings near Mustansiriya University on January 17.
Al-Maqwartar was also the chairman of a committee for consumer protection as well as being the chairman of a performance evaluation committe for a TV show broadcast by al-Sharqiyah TV.
Meanwhile, Iraq's higher education minister survived an attempt on his life when, according to a ministry spokesman, armed men attacked his convoy, killing his personal guard and wounding another.
Abd Ziyab al-Ojeily was attacked in southern Baghdad.
Unknown armed men had hidden in a bush to the side of a highway near Dawra district, and according to the spokesman, Bassel al-Khatib, the men immediately opened fire as the minister's procession passed by.
The armed men and al-Ojeily's guards reportedly exchanged fire. 
One of al-Ojeily's bodyguards was shot down while the other was ""seriously"" wounded.
The minister survived the assassination attempt unscathed.
Spanish police Wednesday arrested a suspected Islamist on charges of links with a terrorist organization, police said.
The detainee was identified as Abdellatif Nekkavi. 
The Moroccan was captured in Badalona near Barcelona.
Police searched addresses in Badalona and other places in the Barcelona region, and were reportedly looking for another suspect.
The arrest was made in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the subsequent detentions of Islamists suspected of sending activists to Iraq.
Nekkavi was believed to have helped to send funds to Iraq and to have supported a holy war against the West, the Interior Ministry said.
He was also allegedly involved in obtaining fake identity documents for Islamists travelling to Iraq.
At least 29 people face trial on February 15 for the Madrid bombings, which killed 191 and injured more than 1,500 people.
A hijacking attempt has ended without any casualties after a plane with 103 people on board was diverted and landed safely in Chad on Wednesday, an airport employee in the capital N'Djamena said.
The hijacker was arrested by Chadian authorities after the plane landed and all 103 people descended.
The passengers have all come off the plane and are at the airport now. 
No one is injured and the hijacker has been arrested, said Fatima Zara, an employee at the N'Djamena airport.
She said the hijacker was a Sudanese refugee who wanted to route the plane to Britain, but this could not be confirmed.
The assailant, who was not armed according to Zara, hijacked a Sudanese passenger plane with 103 people on board.
There were 85 passengers on board the Boeing 737 plane in addition to 18 crew members, but their nationalities were not yet known.
The plane, which belongs to the private Sudanese Air West company, departed Khartoum Airport heading for El-Fasher in western Darfur, an airline source said.
The hijacker had forced the pilot to fly to Chad's capital N'Djamena, the source added. 
Another source at Khartoum airport said the plane was hijacked while in the air, 30 minutes after taking off.
Al-Jazeera TV reported that a number of top Sudanese officials were among the plane passengers.
A major police crackdown on the trafficking of foreign immigrants in Italy led Wednesday to the arrest of more than 780 suspects and a further 1,300 being reported to the authorities.
Police said the suspects, most of them from Eastern Europe and Africa, were apprehended during concerted early morning raids across Italy. 
They are accused of abetting illegal immigration and of forcing scores of young women to prostitute themselves.
Operation Spartacus, codenamed after the famous Roman gladiator-slave, was hailed by Italy's interior minister, Giuliano Amato.
The trafficking and forced prostitution of women, and minors in particular, is one of the most ignoble crimes committed in Italy, Amato said.
Police said Wednesday's arrests capped a four-month-long investigation that allowed them to uncover how human traffickers operate in Italy.
Some girls were bought by traffickers for 200 euros (260 dollars) in their home country and were then brought to Italy, where they were forced to prostitute themselves. 
The money they earned, which averaged 5,000 euros per month, was kept by their captors. 
Women who dared rebel were often beaten and abused.
Police said one 16-year-old girl was forced to have unprotected sex and was sent back on the streets until she was six-months pregnant.
There was absolute wickedness on the part of their exploiters, police chief Francesco Gratteri told reporters.
A total of 45 girls who agreed to cooperate with the investigation were rewarded with a residence permit.
Police also seized 15 apartments, four nightclubs and three labs were prostitutes entertained their guests.
The death toll on Russian roads fell four percent last year but still stayed above 32,000, Deputy Interior Minister Alexander Chekalin said Wednesday. 
Last year 228,648 accidents happened in Russia, killing 32,621 people and injuring 284,811, Interfax news agency quoted Chekalin as saying.
Though the death toll fell, the number of accidents rose 2.4 percent on the 2005 figure, Chekalin said, blaming poor driver training for the carnage.
According to World Bank figures Russia has the highest rate of road accidents in the world, at 12 per 10,000 cars. 
Traffic police are notoriously corrupt, and driving licences are widely obtainable by bribery.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Wednesday urged President Moshe Katsav to resign after it was announced he would be indicted for rape and other sex crimes.
Under these circumstances there is no doubt in my heart that the president cannot continue in his functions and he will have to leave the presidency, Olmert told a security conference, north of Tel Aviv.
Olmert spoke after Katsav said he would temporarily suspend himself from his duties, but refused growing calls that he quit his largely ceremonial post.
I announced today to the Knesset that I would suspend myself from my post, a visibly heated Katsav told reporters at his Jerusalem residence.
The law does not oblige me to resign, he said. 
I will not give in to blackmail.
After a six-month investigation, Attorney General Menahem Mazuz said on Tuesday he intends to indict the 61-year-old on a slew of charges, including raping a female employee when he was tourism minister, sexual harassment, abuse of power, breach of trust and accepting bribes.
The unprecedented action against an Israeli head of state comes amid a spate of corruption allegations against top-level politicians, including Olmert.
The United States on Wednesday urged Sudan to publicly agree to the last phase of a plan to get international peacekeepers into Darfur and prodded reluctant U.N. members to contribute troops to such a mission.
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Khartoum had promised cooperation with the first two phases of a U.N./African Union plan for Darfur. 
But it was balking at agreeing to the final phase, when the bulk of the international peacekeepers would move into war-torn western Sudan.
There is of course a much larger phase three program that is out there on the horizon that the Sudanese have yet to agree to And we would urge them to agree to that, McCormack told reporters.
The first phase involves allowing a small force of U.N. and military and civilian forces into Darfur, which McCormack said Sudan seemed to be complying with. 
This would be followed by a larger contingent of about 2,500 troops, but so far only Bangladesh has put forward volunteers for the second phase.
Under the third phase, about 10,000 more troops would go into Darfur to form a hybrid force with African Union troops. 
The United Nations hopes this force will total about 17,000 soldiers.
Sudan's agreement on the final phase of the plan was even more urgent given the recent spike in violence in Darfur and mounting concern over attacks on aid workers, said McCormack.
I think that what is required of the international community is constant, consistent pressure diplomatic pressure as well as constant review of whether or not the Sudanese are living up to the commitments that they said that they were going to perform on, he said.
The United States has strongly protested what it called the appalling recent attacks on aid workers and told Sudan's government it has an obligation to protect those trying to help people suffering in Darfur. 
McCormack urged the United Nations to come up with the resources and logistical support for Darfur, where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes in four years of violence.
Washington has not offered any U.S. troops for the mission, but has pledged logistical support.
Lebanon's political and economic crisis takes centre stage at an international aid conference on Thursday, with the country's Western-backed leaders hoping anti-government protests don't scare away the donors.
Prime Minister Fouad Siniora has said Lebanon needs billions of dollars to help shore up its debt-riddled finances and to recover from last year's war between Israel and Shi'ite Hezbollah guerrillas.
Hezbollah is spearheading a long-running battle to topple Siniora, and France has warned that the campaign, which turned violent this week, could persuade some donors to hold back.
High ranking representatives from more than 40 countries and organisations will attend the one-day meeting, including U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the new United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon.
The cost of helping Lebanon, however expensive that might seem, is much less than the cost of not helping Lebanon, Siniora told reporters on Wednesday.
French officials said they expected the meeting to raise at least as much as a previous donors' conference in Paris in 2002, which raked in $4.2 billion in aid and loans.
On that occasion, the United States refused to make any commitment, but Rice told reporters as she flew to Paris late on Wednesday that the United States would pledge $770 million for Lebanon, funds that must be approved by the U.S. Congress.
Yesterday's events, if anything, make more important a message from the international community that it supports the democratically elected government of Lebanon and that there should not be violence or efforts at intimidation to try and make governing more difficult for Siniora, Rice said.
France has already said it will offer a 500 million euro ($650 million) loan at very favourable conditions, while the European Commission has pledged nearly 400 million euros.
Western countries are anxious to show the Lebanese people that they have not abandoned them in the wake of the devastating July/August war against Israel which left many mainly Shi'ite areas of the country in ruins.
Hezbollah is funded by Shi'ite Iran and has promised to provide its own financial aid to the war victims.
Washington and Sunni states, including Saudi Arabia, are worried that Lebanon might fall under the influence of Tehran.
Lebanese sources said on Wednesday Saudi Arabia and Iran were negotiating a deal to end Beirut's political standoff, following clashes this week that killed three people and raised fears the country was sliding back towards civil strife.
One source said the Saudis might even present an initiative at the Paris conference.
Once affluent Lebanon is still struggling to rebuild after its 1975-1990 civil war and is weighed down by $40 billion of debt, equal to 180 percent of gross domestic product.
Some donors are likely to link their aid offers to Siniora's ability to push through an economic reform package, which was unveiled this month and includes plans for privatisations, cutting state spending, and hiking taxes.
Increased seismic activities have been recorded in the past one month in the Java-Sumatra- Andaman region of South East Asia, indicating possibility of a major disaster in the near future, according to a senior scientist at the Indian Insititute of Technology (IIT) here.
Though volcanic activities in the region had subsided after the devastating earthquake-triggered tsunami of December 2004, more than 52 earthquakes with varying magnitutde have been recorded in the last one month, D Chandrasekharam, senior professor in the Department of Earth Sciences, IIT, told PTI yesterday.
This appears to be a natural cyclic process but there is a possibility of it triggering a major disaster, he said.
Since December 25, 2006 till today morning (January 24) the entire Java-Sumatra-Andaman island subduction zone experienced more than 51 earthquakes varying in magnitude from 4.2 to 7.5 on the Richter scale, the noted earth science expert said.
These include two major earthquakes - 7.1 magnitude in Taiwan on December 26 and 7.5 in Molucca sea. 
Also 4.9 and 6.1 magnitude earthquakes were recorded in Nicobar Islands.
Majority of these events are associated with thrust fault, an underground phenomenon that had caused the 2004 tsunami killing nearly 2.5 lakh people across several countries, includig India, the scientist said.
This only shows how active this region is seismically. 
Are we prepared with our tsunami warning system to alert people well in advance about any impending natural disaster?, Chandrasekharam asked. 
Chandrasekharam said perhaps a mock trial should be carried out by India to test any tsunami warning system that it is installing.
The recent earthquakes should ring an alarm bell.
Tsunami warning systems should alert coastal population within 10 minutes of occurrence of any major disaster, he said.
Ecuador's defense minister, Guadalupe Larriva, and her daughter were killed late Wednesday in a collision between two military helicopters near a base on the Pacific coast, the president's spokesman said.
The information that we are getting is that there was an accident of two Air Force helicopters, one of which was carrying the defense minister and her daughter, who were killed, Monica Chuji, spokeswoman of the president's office, said.
Larriva took office on January 15, becoming the first woman to serve as defense minister in the country.
Emiliano Mercado del Toro, who spent just a month as the world's oldest person, died on Wednesday at his home on the northern coast of Puerto Rico at 115, the Associated Press reported, quoting his grandniece, Dolores Martinez.
He was born when Puerto Rico was still a Spanish colony and trained as a soldier the year World War I ended, the report said.
He died like a little angel, Martinez was quoted as saying.
Mercado del Toro, who was born on Aug. 21, 1891, became the oldest known person in the world last month when 116-year-old Elizabeth Lizzie Bolden died in December in a nursing home in Tennessee.
A 114-year-old Connecticut woman, Emma Faust Tillman, is now believed to be the oldest living person. Tillman, born Nov. 22, 1892, is followed by Japan's Yone Minagawa, also aged 114.
Mercado del Toro never married and had no children, according to the AP report.
Ecuadorean Defense Minister Guadalupe Larriva was killed on Wednesday in an air crash, military and government sources told Reuters.
Larriva was named as Ecuador's first woman defense minister by newly inaugurated President Rafael Correa, taking office on Jan. 15.
A university professor and leader of the country's small Socialist party, she was also one of only a few civilians to hold the post.
The United States will pledge 770 million dollars in new aid to Lebanon as part of a major international effort to rebuild the country and strengthen Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday.
Rice said the package, to be formally unveiled here Thursday at an international donors conference, would bring total US aid to Lebanon to more than one billion dollars since the devastating 34-day war last July-August between Israel and the radical Islamic group Hezbollah.
Russia and Japan want to strengthen cooperation in the energy industry, the Russian foreign ministry said Wednesday following the first round of talks in a strategic dialogue series.
The sides voiced their views on the issue of ensuring energy security, confirmed readiness to seek ways to step up cooperation in this sphere, including joint projects in the oil, gas and nuclear industry, the ministry said in a statement.
Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Denisov and Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Shotaro Yachi also exchanged views on a wide range of both global and regional security issues, as well as bilateral issues such as the further schedule of political dialogue, it said.
The agenda did not include talks on the four Kuril Islands which have been disputed between Moscow and Tokyo for more than 60 years.
Earlier this week, Denisov said talks on the issue would continue but not as part of the strategic dialogue.
South Korea Thursday ruled out any summit with rival North Korea until it agrees to scrap its nuclear weapons programme.
The two sides held a landmark summit in 2000 but relations have cooled in recent years because of the communist state's missile launches and nuclear weapons test.
An inter-Korean summit will be difficult for the time being, President Roh Moo-Hyun told a New Year news conference.
Only after the conclusion of the six-party talks would inter-Korean issues be fully tackled.
The six-party talks, involving the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, aim to persuade the North to dismantle its nuclear programme in return for energy and economic aid and security guarantees.
The next round is expected early next month and Seoul said Wednesday it expects some progress amid signs of flexibility from Washington and Pyongyang.
Roh's government has pursued a sunshine policy of engagement with its neighbour. There has been media speculation Roh may seek a summit with the North's leader Kim Jong-Il to boost the prospects of his preferred candidate in the December 2007 presidential election.
Roh also said he does not know if the North will go ahead with a second nuclear weapons test following its first in October.
I don't know if it's possible or not but we're fully prepared for any unexpected situation, he said.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday that Seoul would strengthen surveillance of the North's nuclear activity this year and build up defences.
US military forces carried out a second air strike in southern Somalia this week against suspected Al-Qaeda operatives, a US official confirmed Wednesday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the attack Monday was directed at lesser known figures with ties to Al-Qaeda rather than senior leaders of the network in East Africa.
It wasn't any of the Al-Qaeda East Africa guys, the official said.
The Pentagon refused to confirm or deny that an AC-130 gunship carried out a strike in southern Somalia for the second time this month.
There will be times when there are activities and operations I can talk about, and there will be other times when I just won't have anything for you, said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. 
And I don't have anything for you on Somalia.
Whitman had previously confirmed an initial strike in southern Somalia on January 8 that also was aimed at suspected Al-Qaeda leaders in the turbulent region.
The US official said it was doubtful that the first strike got any of the big guys.
While not confirming a second strike, Whitman said, We're going to go after Al-Qaeda in the war on terror where it takes us.
We'll work closely and in cooperation with countries around the world to include this region, but the very nature of some of our operations are not conducive to public discussion, he said.
The Washington Post cited unnamed US officials as saying the AC-130 gunship was operating in close cooperation with Ethiopian forces.
Ethiopian troops entered Somalia last month to help the weak Somali government against the country's rising Islamist movement accused by many of harboring some members of Al-Qaeda.
The Ethiopians have conducted ground and air assaults in the same area, and share intelligence and operational information with the US forces, according to the Post.
The U.S. ambassador to Iraq said on Wednesday he would like British troops to stay in the country, even as pressure mounts on Prime Minister Tony Blair to reduce Britain's deployment in the south.
We are committed to the increase of the force, Zalmay Khalilzad told BBC News in an interview, referring to the planned expansion of U.S. troops on the ground.
The Brits obviously are not committed to the increasing of the force but there are various reports about further drawdowns, Khalizad said.
Asked whether he would prefer British troop numbers to remain at about 7,100 in southern Iraq, the ambassador replied: We would like the British to co-ordinate and for us to have a joint plan. We are talking about this.
It is clear what our preference would be the longer we stay together here the better.
A spokesman at Blair's Downing Street office insisted that U.S. and British strategy remained co-ordinated.
We will leave southern Iraq in negotiation with coalition partners and the government of Iraq when all three of us have decided the time is right and the conditions are right, he said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Blair said it would be deeply irresponsible to set an arbitrary deadline for pulling British forces out of Iraq. 
But the prime minister is under pressure to set such a date before he steps down later this year.
Government officials say British operations aimed at preparing for the handover of security in the southern province of Basra to Iraqi authorities could be wound up in February.
In contrast, U.S. President George W. Bush urged Congress on Tuesday to back his plan to send an additional 21,500 U.S. troops to Iraq to try to restore order in Baghdad.
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's cabinet will discuss refinancing the country's controversial mission in Afghanistan on Thursday, a political source said, amid a growing political storm over the issue.
The Afghan mission was not on the cabinet meeting's official agenda but will be discussed anyway, the source said. 
Earlier this week, a Green Party minister in Prodi's fragile coalition threatened a revolt over the mission, demanding a timetable for the withdrawal of Italian troops.
Parliament has to approve funding for missions abroad every six months, and Prodi would have to rely on the opposition led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for votes without Green Party support.
Italy pulled out of Iraq last year but Prodi has pledged to keep its 1,900 troops in Afghanistan, arguing that it is a peace mission. 
A recent newspaper poll showed 56 percent of Italians are now in favour of withdrawing from Afghanistan.
Al Qaeda second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahri warned Americans of a reprisal far worse than anything they have seen if Washington did not change its policies towards Muslim states.
0You are facing the Islamic rage what awaits you, should you press on (with current policies), is far worse than anything you have seen, Zawahri said in a video posted on the Internet on Wednesday.
Leaders of the militant group which carried out the Sept. 11, 2001 aircraft attacks against U.S. cities often argue that its terrorism is justified as a way to change pro-Israel U.S. policies and to punish Washington for its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
I will talk to you in a language you understand; If you want to live safely you have to accept reality and reject the illusions that (U.S. President George W.) Bush is trying to deceive you with, he said in the video.
Part of the video was posted earlier this week on the Web site of the U.S.-based SITE institute.
You have to try your utmost to reach an understanding with the Muslims, only then you will enjoy security. 
But if you continue with the policy of Bush and his gang then you won't dream of it, he said.
Zawahri also vowed retaliation against Ethiopian troops for helping the Somalia's interim government rout rival Islamist.
The Mujahideen will break their backs with God's power and help, Zawahri said.
Ethiopia said on Tuesday its forces began leaving the Somali capital. 
It has said it does not plan to stay after it completes its mission.
The Egyptian militant also urged Palestinians to abandon President Mahmoud Abbas as a traitor and said he had sold his religion and Palestinian land.
Nigerian gunmen have abducted two or three Chinese oil workers in the southern delta state of Bayelsa, police said on Thursday.
The men were working for the Chinese National Petroleum Company (CNPC) when they were seized by the gunmen who also looted the company's office, police said.
The abduction brings to 32 the number of foreign workers being held by armed groups in the remote swamps of the Niger Delta, Africa's oil heartland, where militancy is on the rise.
There was an attack on a Chinese company, CNPC this morning and two or three Chinese workers were abducted, Bayelsa state police commissioner Hafiz Ringim told Reuters.
The company's accounts office was also burgled, but I can't confirm how much money was taken away by the attackers, Ringim said by telephone from the state capital Yenagoa.
Another officer said one of the attackers was killed in a shootout with security forces, while others were injured. 
It was not clear if the attack was a case of robbery.
Militants and criminals seeking ransoms have kept up a series of attacks and kidnappings against foreign workers in the Niger Delta, a vast wetlands region which is home to all of Nigeria's oil resources.
Israeli troops killed a young Palestinian in the West Bank city of Tulkarm on Thursday, medics and witnesses said.
Witnesses said the troops shot dead 17-year-old Fadel Balawneh, described by Palestinian security sources as a member of Islamic Jihad, as he tried to run away from a building which the army was surrounding.
An Israeli army spokeswoman said soldiers fired at Balawneh when he tried to escape. 
The army accused him of being involved in building rockets and plotting bomb attacks against Israelis on orders from Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.
Israeli forces have mounted frequent raids in the occupied West Bank since the start of a Palestinian uprising in 2000.
In Gaza, an Islamist Palestinian group which says it was behind a series of bomb attacks at Internet cafes and video stores claimed responsibility for bombing the offices of the Arab satellite channel Al-Arabiya on Monday.
The Rightful Swords of Islam said in a statement the bombing was a message to those in charge of this channel and other channels which put themselves in the service of Zionist and other gangs who have no business but to fight Islam and Muslims.
The Arabiya newsroom was empty when an explosive device placed outside detonated, police said, and no one was injured.
The group's statement, which could not immediately be authenticated, said Al-Arabiya had repeatedly spread fabricated news.
A car bomb ripped through a shopping district in central Baghdad on Thursday, killing 20 people and wounding 20 others, a police source said.
The loud blast in Karrada district rattled windows some distance away and sent up a large plume of black smoke.
A health ministry source put the death toll at 18 with 62 more wounded. 
Official casualty tolls from bomb attacks often vary because of the ensuing chaos.
The car bomb, which was followed by bursts of gunfire, was one of a string of blasts that rocked the capital including some that sparked sirens and warnings in the international Green Zone.
About an hour and a half later another blast rocked the Karrada area, near where the car bomb had exploded. 
A police source said police deliberately blew up a suspicious vehicle.
The government is preparing to launch a new security plan aimed at stemming sectarian violence in the capital, but since it was announced this month there have been a series of bombings and no sign of any let up in death squad killings.
Earlier another three people were killed and 10 wounded by a roadside bomb in Baya'a in western Baghdad and a motorbike rigged with explosives blew up at the entrance of the central Shurja market, killing four people and wounding 20, police said.
A car bomb also hit the Mureidi market on Thursday afternoon in Sadr City, a Shi'ite stronghold in northeast Baghdad, police said. 
One person was killed and 13 wounded, the source said.
Two rockets hit the Green Zone, sparking alarms and warnings urging people to take cover. 
Black smoke was seen rising from the area of the Green Zone but the U.S. military said it had no immediate information on casualties or damage.
A Regional Airlines plane carrying 54 people crashed into a small truck in the south of France on Thursday, killing the driver, the Transport Ministry said.
The incident happened near the Pau-Pyrenees airport after a bird flew into the plane's engine.
The 50 passengers and four cabin staff on the Fokker 100 were not injured and were evacuated from the plane.
The aircraft, which was taking off, had to carry out an emergency landing next to the runway after a bird flew into one of the engines, a statement from the ministry said.
The plane hit the public works truck travelling on a road around the airport and the driver died in the accident, it said. 
The plane came to a stop several hundred metres later.
An inquiry has been ordered into the accident.
Four people were shot dead in clashes between pro- and anti-government activists in Lebanon on Thursday, casting a shadow over donor pledges of $7.6 billion to the U.S.-backed government facing a Hezbollah-led challenge.
Two opposition students and two other people were shot dead and 35 were injured, many by gunfire, at Beirut's Arab University, security sources said. 
Fighting started between students with sticks and stones on the university campus then spilled into nearby streets. 
It developed into exchanges of gunfire from assault rifles and pistols involving students and residents from both sides.
An opposition campaign against the government, which is struggling to recover from last year's war with Israel, has raised tensions between Sunnis and Shi'ites in Lebanon, still recovering from a 1975-90 civil war.
It was not immediately clear who opened fire but NBN and Al-Manar television, run by the opposition's Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah movement, blamed the shootings on pro-government gunmen loyal to Sunni leader Saad al-Hariri.
Soldiers fired into the air to try to disperse the crowds and were later deployed in large numbers in an effort to control the clashes. 
Thick smoke rose from the area, where rioters had set cars and tyres ablaze.
Soldiers used military trucks to evacuate scores of civilians trapped on the streets by the violence.
Rival television stations blamed each other's camps for the fighting. Witnesses reported shots fired at students from rooftops in the mainly Sunni areas and attacks by a Shi'ite mob on a Sunni-run school in another area of the capital.
Hezbollah issued a statement urging its supporters to pull out of the streets around the university, while Hariri urged supporters to show self-restraint and calm.
Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said from Paris where he was at an aid conference: I call on everyone to return to the voice of reason.
The clashes died down after the appeals but tension in several Beirut neighbourhoods was high after darkness.
Turkish police blew up a suspicious package outside parliament on Thursday which carried a note calling for the release of two suspects in the murder of a prominent Turkish-Armenian editor, police said.
The package contained a timer but no explosives, police told Reuters.
The note, from a shadowy ultra-nationalist group TIT, called for the release of suspects Ogan Samast and Yasin Hayal. 
Five men, including Samast and Hayal, have been charged in connection with the murder of Hrant Dink.
Afghanistan, Pakistan and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) on Thursday opened a joint intelligence-sharing centre in Kabul to coordinate the fight against Taliban-led insurgents.
It was an historic day for the Operation Enduring Freedom - the US operation against terror and insurgents -  top ISAF commander General David Richards, told reporters at the inaugural ceremony.
The opening came amid accusations by Afghan officials that some elements inside Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were helping and training the Taliban insurgents who cross the porous border to attack Afghan and international forces.
In 2006, Afghanistan experienced its worst year since a US-led coalition invasion ousted the Taliban regime in late 2001. 
The bloodshed mainly occurred in areas bordering Pakistan.
Commending the Pakistani army's role in sharing information on the insurgents, Richards said that the reason the Taliban had failed in 2006 was the close cooperation between armies and police forces on both sides of the border.
There is a great deal of cooperation on a daily basis, Richards said. 
But the new centre would enable Afghan, Pakistani and ISAF officers to work together even more efficiently.
The joint centre would work on operations, intelligence, and technical issues, and share information on the Afghan-Pakistani border areas. 
It would comprise six liaison officers each from Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as 12 ISAF members.
Richards also announced the deployment of a new brigade of combat operation forces from ISAF nations in the near future, but did not elaborate on their exact number or nationality.
Some 33,000 soldiers from 37 ISAF nations are currently stationed in Afghanistan, while an additional 8,000 US forces are acting independently in tracking down the remnants of the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda network in the war against terror.
Twelve Palestinians including five members of Hamas's security force were wounded Thursday when an explosive device hit their jeep in northern Gaza, a Hamas spokesman said.
Five of the wounded were members of the Hamas 'executive force' and the others were civilians, said Islam Shawan, adding that the attack took place in the Jabaliya refugee camp.
Two of the wounded were in serious condition, he said.
Internecine violence between supporters of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and followers of the ruling Hamas movement who have been unable to agree on a unity government has killed around 30 people since mid-December.
A US soldier has pleaded guilty to murdering three detainees in Iraq last year, an Army spokeswoman said.
Private Corey Clagett, 21 a member of the 101st Airborne Division, admitted to murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to obstruct justice, the spokeswoman said.
Clagett is the third soldier to plead guilty in connection with the killings May 9 during an operation in the central Iraq province of Salheddine.
Clagett's sentencing in the court-martial at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, was pending.
Specialist William Hunsaker, 24, pleaded guilty to the murders earlier this month and received an 18-year prison term. 
Specialist Justin Graber, 21, received a nine-month prison term on charges of aggravated assault with a dangerous weapons in connection to the murders. 
Both men are also members of the 101st Airborne Division.
An attack on Iran would be catastrophic and encourage it to develop a nuclear bomb, Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on Thursday.
It would be absolutely counterproductive, and it would be catastrophic, ElBaradei said at a discussion on nuclear proliferation at the World Economic Forum.
The Bush administration in recent weeks has toughened its stance against Iran, which the West has accused of seeking to secretly build an atomic bomb, raising fears among political and business leaders that the U.S. plans an attack.
President George W. Bush has moved an additional aircraft carrier into the Gulf and told Iran that he would not allow it to provide weapons and support to insurgents in Iraq.
Israel has refused to rule out pre-emptive military action against Iran on the lines of its 1981 air strike against an atomic reactor in Iraq, although many analysts believe Iran's nuclear facilities are too much for Israel to destroy alone.
The United Nations imposed sanctions in December to prevent Iran using its nuclear energy programme for military weapons, and Iran this week banned 38 IAEA nuclear inspectors.
ElBaradei, head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, has been engaged in meetings here at the gathering of world political and business leaders. 
He said diplomacy is the only way forward, and talk of military action can only backfire.
This strengthens the hands of those in Iran who say 'let's develop a bomb to protect ourselves, he said.
The Bush administration has said it wants a diplomatic solution and that it is not preparing to attack either Iran or Syria.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz also warned against an attack, while Iran's former president Mohammad Khatami urged calm to reduce tensions over Iran's nuclear programme.
If there is military action, it will have catastrophic results, not only in the region, but the whole world, Aziz said.
I hope they would be good enough in managing the situation. 
We deeply need patience and understanding and not to get too emotional, Khatami said.
ElBaradei said force should not be ruled out, but past experience has shown that it should not be used with haste, citing Iraq where no evidence of nuclear weapons was found after the U.S.-led invasion.
I am convinced that the only way forward in Iran is engagement, ElBaradei said. 
We have to invest in peace, he said, adding that if the international community failed to do that the consequence will be 10 times worse.
I hope we will stop speaking about a military option and focus on finding a solution, ElBaradei said.
Iran says it needs nuclear power to generate electricity but the West fears it is secretly seeking an atom bomb. 
In December, the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iran's trade in sensitive nuclear materials and technology to try and stop enrichment work that could produce bomb material.
The Lebanese army on Thursday declared a night curfew in Beirut after at least four people died in clashes between pro- and anti-government activists.
The curfew will take effect at 8:30 p.m. Thursday and last until 6 a.m. Friday, an army spokesman said.
Two opposition students and two other people were shot dead and 100 were injured, many by gunfire, at Beirut's Arab University, Reuters reported, quoting security sources.
Fighting erupted between students with sticks and stones on the university campus then spilled into nearby streets, the report said, adding it developed into exchanges of gunfire from assault rifles and pistols involving students and residents from both sides.          
Gunmen killed an activist with Fatah-linked militant group Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Gaza early on Friday, Fatah said, hours after a member of a Hamas-led security force was killed by a roadside bomb.
More than 30 Palestinians have been killed in fighting between rival groups Hamas and Fatah since Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called last month for early presidential and parliamentary elections.
Hospital officials confirmed the activist had been killed by gunfire in the northern Gaza Strip.
Fatah accused the Hamas-led security force of ""executing"" the activist.
A spokesman for the Hamas-led force was not available for comment.
Local residents said members of the Hamas-led force had surrounded the home of the activist and gunfire ensued. 
They had sought to question him in response to the roadside bomb.
The bomb blast left a second member of the Hamas-led force in a critical condition and wounded seven others, hospital officials said. 
Three bystanders, including two children, were among those wounded, they added.
No one claimed responsibility for the bomb attack, which also took place in northern Gaza.
Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif Qanoua said on Thursday it would ""chase those killers who carried out this cowardly action"".
Earlier this week, Palestinian factions including Hamas and Fatah resumed talks on forming a coalition government. 
Similar talks broke down last year.
Hamas has struggled to govern since taking office in March under the weight of U.S.-led sanctions imposed because of its refusal to recognise Israel, renounce violence and abide by interim peace deals.
Fatah's Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal held inconclusive unity talks in Damascus this week.
Fresh protests broke out in Guinea on  Thursday on the 16th day of a general strike that has paralysed the country and  claimed 59 lives, with demonstrators insisting President Lansana Conte step down. 
The long-time head of state had agreed in principle Wednesday to one of the  protesters' key demands to appoint a prime minister and crisis talks re-started late Thursday between representatives of Conte's regime and trades unions. 
Police said some 15,000 demonstrators took to the streets of the main  administrative centre of Kankan, in the east, chanting: Change now and We want no more of Conte, he must go. 
Protesters urged the union leaders engaged in the crisis talks to beware of  cunning by the 72-year-old president, who has ruled poverty-stricken Guinea since 1984. 
Hundreds of others demonstrators gathered in central Labe and Yimberin in  the north, police and witnesses reported. 
In the capital Conakry, there were fewer police and troops on the streets  than on Monday, the bloodiest day of the strike, when security forces fired at demonstrators during running battles. 
A total of 49 demonstrators were shot dead 34 in Conakry and 15 in the provinces and a further 267 wounded in Monday's crackdown, health ministry official Sidiki Diakate told AFP on Thursday. 
In all, 59 people have been killed since the strike began on January 10,  sparking international condemnation. 
The government on Thursday promised to investigate the violence on the sidelines of the general strike. 
All the attacks on physical integrity and the destruction will be subject to objective inquiries and those guilty will be transmitted to competent tribunals, Interior Minister Moussa Solano said in a statement read on public radio. 
Cautious of Conte, who has ruled for 23 years, the leaders of Guinea's powerful unions said on Wednesday they would continue the strike until the president, who suffers from chronic diabetes and memory lapses, accedes to all their demands. 
They made ending the strike contingent on guarantees that a new broad-based government of national unity would be formed, under a new prime minister. 
The post of head of government has been empty since April 2006, when Conte sacked incumbent Cellou Dalein Diallo. 
We have been on strike for 16 days. 
We do not want the mountain to give birth to a mouse. So we are not compromising on that issue, Rabiatou Serah Diallo, secretary general of the National Confederation of Workers of Guinea, told AFP. 
Observers are sceptical of Conte's willingness to relinquish any powers. 
Three premiers appointed since 1996 have all resigned or been sacked after falling out with the president. 
The strike, which has support from 14 opposition parties, was called in protest at economic hardships and official corruption and to demand Conte's resignation. 
It has shut down the mines in the world's top exporter of bauxite, a mineral used to make aluminium. 
Conte took power in a bloodless military coup in 1984 and then won successive presidential elections but the last poll in 2003 was boycotted by the opposition. 
Ibrahim Sarsour, member of Israeli parliament (Knesset) and leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel, has warned that Israel is still digging and carrying out excavations under Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, in a way that threatens the foundation of the mosque. 
Sarsour said that the Israeli government paid a Palestinian vendor $60,000 for his store bordering with the Temple Mount compound on which the mosque is located, according to a report carried by the Israeli online daily newspaper Haaretz. 
The newspaper report said that several leaders of the movement plan to present information about an upcoming digging that Israel intends to carry under the mosque. 
Excavations referred to by Sarsour were carried out some 100 meters from the Temple Mount and were stopped due to lack of funds, claimed Haaretz report. 
The excavations, carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority at the behest of a Jewish group, on a property owned by businessman Aaron Mosovitch, was first revealed by Haaretz about a year ago. 
Israeli archeologists, who argued that the digging was aimed at clearing out an old garbage-filled tunnel to determine whether it posed a safety hazard, said that the excavations are horizontal and vertical, and that they advanced to within 60 meters of the mosque, reported Islamonline.net. 
Sheikh Raed Salah, the Northern branch leader of the Islamic Movement, which presented pictures depicting the excavations near the mosque, said that the digging comes to fulfill Israel's darkest dream of building a Jewish temple in place of the Al Aqsa mosque. 
It's noteworthy that the Jewish State's dangerous excavations near the holy Mosque aimed at destabilizing its foundations, have been going since Israel occupied the East of Jerusalem after the war in 1967. 
An explosion at a student dormitory in Moscow blew a small hole in a wall and smashed windows but no one was hurt, Interfax news agency said on Friday quoting the emergencies ministry.
The blast was on the staircase between the 17th and 18th floors of a 19-storey building that houses students at Moscow State University, the agency quoted Yevgeny Bobylov, an emergencies ministry spokesman, as saying.
The cause of the blast at the dormitory, in southern Moscow, was unknown and it did not cause a fire, Bobylov said.
Parliamentarians from the Asia-Pacific region adopted a resolution Thursday supporting denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and continuation of the six-nation talks on the issue.
During the just-ended five-day meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, participants discussed the possibility of North Korea's joining future sessions as an observer, according to Russia's Federation Council Chairman Sergey Mironov, who chaired the forum.
But the participants in the 15th annual forum, which comprises nearly 30 countries, failed to agree to North Korea's participation as some members, such as Japan, were opposed to it, Mironov said.
The six-nation talks on North Korea's nuclear programs involve China, Japan, South and North Korea, Russia and the United States. 
The countries except for North Korea are also members of the parliamentary forum.
Lawmakers from Japan who attended the forum included former farm minister Yoshinobu Shimamura and former education minister Hirofumi Nakasone.
The six-nation talks have yet to make tangible progress toward denuclearization of the peninsula since being launched in 2003 and its members are working on resuming the talks, which adjourned last month, possibly next month.
Drinking moderate amounts of caffeine during pregnancy does not lead to premature births or underweight babies, Danish scientists said on Friday. 
Up to three cups of coffee a day does not seem to have any negative impact on the baby or the pregnancy. 
Earlier studies that looked at the impact of moderate caffeine consumption during pregnancy have produced mixed results. 
Some showed no difference while others suggested too much caffeine could lower average birth weight by 100-200 grams (3.5-7 ounces). 
In our study we found no effect from caffeine, said Dr Bodil Hammer Bech, of the Institute of Public Health in Aarhus, Denmark. 
Unlike other research projects in which women who had given birth were asked how much coffee they drank while pregnant, the Danish scientists monitored 1,207 pregnant coffee lovers who were randomly selected to drink either a caffeinated or decaffeinated brew during the second half of the pregnancy. 
The women did not know which group they were in. 
We had two groups and we actually found no difference between the average birth weight for moderate intake of caffeine -- about three cups, said Bech, whose findings are reported online by the British Medical Journal. 
The difference in the weight of the babies between the two groups was 20 grams (0.7 ounce) and there was no difference in the gestational age, she told Reuters. 
In the caffeinated group, 4.2 percent of babies were born premature compared to 5.2 percent in women drinking decaffeinated coffee. 
The number of infants who were small for their gestational age were nearly the same in both groups. 
Bech said women who drink a lot of coffee usually smoke and drink more alcohol than other females, which could influence birth weight. 
But because the women were randomised in the study, the other factors that may have an effect on the baby and the pregnancy were equal in the two groups. 
In an earlier study, Bech and her team showed that excessive coffee consumption, eight cups or more, could increase the risk of stillbirth. 
About three cups of coffee a day is OK but women with a higher intake should be careful, said Bech. 
A new magazine called Muslim Girl has been launched this month, giving over 400,000 teen-aged Muslim girls in the United States the chance for the first time to be a cover girl. 
The girls are eager to have their stories told, said Ausma Khan, editor in chief of Muslim Girl Magazine, in an interview. 
There is information for every group, our community is definitely underserved, she said, the Magazine has issued 25,000-copies and expects its circulation to be four times that in two years, Islamonline.net reported. 
Wardah Chaudhary, a 16-year old Muslim girl from Tulsa, Oklahoma, was the magazine?s first cover girl. 
Those interested to become the cover girl of the magazine's upcoming issues can log on to the magazine's website
One thing I know for sure is that I am not behind in anything just because I wear Hijab, Chaudhary, who appeared on the magazine's cover wearing a red and white head covering, with tiny red, white and blue stars on her right cheeks, said in her essay referring to her style of Hijab. 
To all the girls that are reading this, I want them to know to be proud of who you are.
The magazine's initial copies were mainly distributed in areas known to have large Muslim populations, including New York; Jersey City, New Jersey; Dearborn, Michigan; Chicago, Los Angeles and areas of Texas. 
There is also plans to distribute the magazine in Ontario and Toronto, said Ausma Khan, who is a lawyer and writer. 
The new bi-monthly glossy magazine launched this month to give 400,000 American Muslim teen girls a lively and uniquely relevant perspective on contemporary living, according to a press statement of the magazine's publisher. 
A survey conducted for the magazine found out that Muslim girls like to watch television, read teen magazines, surf the Internet, like YouTube.com, and enjoy video games.
Girls also like to shop and hang out a lot. 
The study also highlighted some likely differences: for example, they socialize at IslamiCity and count among their top hobbies, Qur'an study. 
Ausma Khan, PhD, writer, human rights lawyer and activist, liked the concept so much that she left a teaching position at Northwestern University to become editor in chief. Most representations of Muslims in the media are negative, she said. 
Ausma Khan said: We're showing Hijab-wearing basketball players alongside contemporary fashion designers and artists. 
We want to dispel the notion that Muslim teens conform to one particular model. Veiled or unveiled, Muslim girls participate fearlessly in sports, the arts, international travel and their local mosques. 
Muslim Girl Magazine launched with a planned circulation of 50,000 copies per issue in the first year and expects to grow to 100,000 within two years. 
The magazine is published by award-winning execuGo Media of Toronto, Canada and distributed worldwide by RCS of Los Angeles, California.
Daytime curfews were imposed on four towns in southeastern Nepal Friday after several deaths and dozens of injuries during violent protests in the impoverished region, local officials said.
The situation remains serious today as dozens of protesters have already attempted to defy the curfew, said local administrator Madhav Prasad Regmi from Janakpur, 375 kilometres (232 miles) southeast of Kathmandu.
The violent protests began last week after a 16-year-old boy was shot dead during a scuffle between Maoists and Mahadhesi activists demanding increased political representation in the Himalayan nation.
Nepali Mahadhesi community leaders have said that the ethnic group accounts for around a third of Nepal's 27 million people.
They dominate the Terai region, situated in the southern plains bordering India, and have long complained of discrimination by highland communities.
Officials in the area said at least 35 protesters were injured Thursday in Janakpur, and at least 20 more hurt in Birgunj, another of the four towns under curfew along with Biratnagar and Lahan.
Protests earlier this week left at least five protesters dead.
The leader of the group organising the protests warned that unless Nepal's government addressed their complaints, the unrest would continue.
The country has only recently seen an end to ten years of civil war with Maoist insurgents, after the rebels and coalition government signed a peace deal bringing the Maoists into parliament and government.
If they try to ignore the issue, the protests will have dire consequences, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the recently formed Mahadhesi Janadhikar Forum, told AFP.
Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has called on the group to come for dialogue, and the Mahadhesi leader urged Koirala to name a date for talks.
This movement is taking place because the people of the Terai region have always been discriminated against by the state. 
He also complained about the new composition of the 330-seat parliament, where the Maoists now have 83 seats.
There are only 73 Mahadhesis from various political parties in the current parliament. 
The English language Nepali Times also warned in a front-page editorial that Nepal would be falling from the frying pan into the fire if it failed to tackle the issue.
The root of the crisis is deep, long standing bitterness among the Mahadhesi population. Discriminated against by governments in the past, they saw that they would be denied political representation in proportion to their numbers by the interim constitution too, the paper said.
Nepal's Maoists, however, have said that pro-Royalists and militant Hindus are involved in the protests and merely trying to undermine a peace process which has left King Gyanendra and the monarchy as a whole facing the boot.
But Yadav said his group was also opposed to the monarchy.
Where there is unrest, there can be room for someone to use the situation to their benefit. 
The palace may try to take advantage of this situation, but we won't let it happen because we are also against monarchy. 
We are not monarchists, we also want a republic, he said.
This percentage is very low, we want more representation, said Yadav.
Even the new interim government is not addressing our problems so we are fighting for equality, Yadav told AFP.
International media rights groups have demanded the release of three Sri Lankan journalists who went missing earlier this week in the capital Colombo.
The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) urged President Mahinda Rajapakse to give unequivocal orders for three journalists and trade union activists, kidnapped in Colombo on Monday, to be found and released unharmed.
The three men -- who were working for a railway trade union monthly, the Akuna, or thunder -- were abducted by unidentified men late Monday, police said.
State-run media said the men, all members of the majority Sinhalese community, were believed to have received weapons training from the rebel Tamil Tigers. 
The men were described in the reports as terrorist suspects.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists also demanded the release of the three men, saying they could be in government custody.
We fear for the safety of the three missing newspaper staff members, and we call on the government to publicly disclose any information regarding their whereabouts, CPJ executive director Joel Simon said in a statement.
The CPJ had also demanded last month that Sri Lankan authorities either immediately free or bring charges against a journalist detained under anti-terror laws for a long period.
The government should not resort to holding journalists for prolonged periods and then hide behind bold accusations of terrorism that it fails to substantiate, the CPJ said of the arrest of Maunasami Parameswaree.
The Tamil reporter has been held since November.
The tough Prevention of Terrorism laws invoked by the government in December allows police and security forces to detain suspects for long periods without trial.
Media activists have accused the government of imposing unofficial censorship in the northern peninsula of Jaffna where two Tamil newspaper employees were shot dead last year by unidentified gunmen.
In its 2006 review, RSF said decades of fighting between Sri Lankan troops and Tamil Tiger rebels has had a major impact on the freedom of the media.
The dormant war between security forces and the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) has had harmful consequences for the safety of journalists, particularly Tamils, Reporters Without Borders said.
Journalists from the Sinhalese community also have been either killed, beaten or intimidated for their coverage of the conflict between the government and the rebels, who are fighting for independence for minority Tamils.
There is no official censorship in the country, but columnists have said that they were under pressure to practice self-censorship.
Media organisations have described Sri Lanka as one of the most dangerous places for journalists in South Asia.
Nepal's Maoist leader said Wednesday that his former rebels and the government will offer concessions and talks in a bid to end a wave of ethnic unrest gripping the south of the country.
Prachanda, who uses one name, told AFP in an interview that the Maoists and government would announce their willingness to address the genuine demands of the masses and also have dialogue with people who are trying to organise the movement.
I think today it will be resolved, he said.
The unrest flared nearly three weeks ago after a Maoist cadre killed a protester and there has been widespread rioting by Mahadhesi groups in Nepal's southern Terai region since.
Eighteen protesters and one police officer have been killed during the protests. 
Hundreds have been injured and roads to the capital have been blocked for nearly three weeks.
The Mahadhesi community, which dominates the country's southern plains and accounts for around a third of Nepal's 27 million people, has long complained of discrimination and being shut out of power.
The leader of the group that claims to be behind the protests has said he wants to establish the Mahadhes as an autonomous region, and win Mahadhesis more seats in government.
The Maoist leader said that although the Mahadhesis had genuine demands that needed to be addressed, the unrest had been fuelled by pro-royalists, the United States and Indian Hindu extremists.
The whole thing is motivated to marginalise our influence among the Mahadhesi people, said Prachanda, whose name means the fierce one.
Several former royal-appointed ministers and pro-monarchists were arrested or placed under surveillance last week, accused of fomenting the unrest.
But Mahadhesi leaders deny any royal links.
The violence has cast a cloud over the new government, which has pledged to hold elections this year to rewrite the constitution and decide the future of the monarchy.
King Gyanendra handed back power to parliament in April 2006 after mass protests led by an alliance of political parties and the Maoists.
Russia's chief delegate to the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programs arrived in Beijing on Wednesday morning, ahead of negotiations that will begin Thursday, according to China's state-run Xinhua News Agency.
Alexander Losyukov was the first of the delegates from overseas to arrive in the Chinese capital. 
The Japanese, South Korean and U.S. representatives are expected to arrive later Wednesday.
China's chief negotiator Wu Dawei told a Japanese lawmaker earlier in the week that the North Korean delegate to the talks, Kim Kye Gwan, will arrive in Beijing on Thursday.
The delegates are scheduled to hold bilateral talks ahead of the start of the six-party negotiations, which will follow discussions held in Beijing in December.
The December six-way talks, which marked their resumption after a 13-month hiatus, failed to make tangible progress toward the countries' goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
In Tokyo on Tuesday, the Japanese and U.S. delegates agreed to work to make North Korea implement, not simply pledge to take, concrete steps for abandoning its nuclear programs, with the U.S. negotiator giving Pyongyang a timeframe of single-digit weeks.
Something has to happen on the ground, Christopher Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told a group of Japanese reporters during the visit.
North Korea is reportedly seeking more than 500,000 tons of fuel oil and other benefits in exchange for taking initial steps to abandon its nuclear programs, such as halting a reactor in the Yongbyon nuclear complex and accepting international inspections.     
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the Diet on Wednesday rejected opposition demands for welfare minister Hakuo Yanagisawa's resignation over his controversial remarks about women.
During a House of Representatives Budget Committee session, Abe apologized for Yanagisawa's remarks on Jan. 27 describing women as birth-giving machines, calling it inappropriate.
But Abe said, I want the health, labor and welfare minister to fulfill his duties from the standpoint of the people.
Abe's comments came after Yanagisawa also apologized in the same committee session but refused to bow to opposition calls to resign.
Gunmen disguised as soldiers killed seven people at two police stations in the troubled Mexican resort of Acapulco on Tuesday, despite a military crackdown against violent drug gangs.
The state prosecutor's office said men dressed in khaki uniforms and wearing red berets tricked their way into the stations by posing as soldiers on a visit to check police weapons.
Accompanied by men filming the attacks, the group opened fire with assault rifles at one station, killing three policemen.
At the second station, the attackers stripped several agents of their guns and started shooting, killing a secretary, two police officers and a public prosecutor.
They pretended to check police guns. 
That's how they disarmed the guys and once they were disarmed, took their lives, a spokesman at the prosecutors office said.
President Felipe Calderon called an emergency meeting with his security cabinet to discuss the attacks.
Calderon, who took office on Dec. 1, has sent thousands of troops to violent regions of Mexico to tackle drug gangs who killed 2,000 people in a feud last year.
As part of the clampdown, soldiers have been investigating local police forces for connections with the drug cartels. 
In the rowdy border city of Tijuana, just south of San Diego, the army confiscated all the city police's guns.
Last month, almost 8,000 troops and federal police were sent to the region around Acapulco to crack down on rival gangs fighting for control of lucrative drug plantations and smuggling routes.
Despite the crackdown, there were 190 drug gang-related deaths in Mexico in January, just a handful less than a year ago.
Acapulco rose to fame in the 1950s as a Pacific hangout for Hollywood stars like actor Errol Flynn.
Once a small fishing village, it is now a major city experiencing a grisly crime wave. 
Just last weekend, a man's chopped-up body was discovered dumped in plastic garbage bags in the city.
Long forgotten by the A-list, the resort is still popular with U.S. spring break student vacationers and Mexican tourists.
A man was being tested for avian influenza in Cyprus on Wednesday after displaying flu-like symptoms following a trip to Thailand, authorities said, but stressed the tests were only a precaution.
The man, who media described as a European national, arrived in Cyprus from Germany on Tuesday. 
He had earlier visited Thailand, which has had several cases of the virus.
The diagnosis from doctors is that the risk of it being avian influenza is minimal. 
It is probably a common infection, but this is a precaution, Health Minister Charis Charalambous told state radio.
The man was being kept in isolation at a hospital in the southern town of Limassol. 
Biological samples have been sent to Athens for testing and results were expected by Friday.
The H5N1 virus has spread into the Middle East, Africa and Europe since it re-emerged in Asia in 2003. 
Although it remains largely an animal disease, it can kill people who come into close contact with infected birds.
It is known to have killed at least 165 people since 2003. 
A French diplomat representing the European Union has been murdered in the Ivory Coast, several diplomatic sources said Wednesday.
They said unknown attackers killed the man overnight Tuesday and his body was found at his home in Abidjan. 
Authorities briefly detained one of the lawyers for jailed former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky on Wednesday at Chita airport in southeastern Siberia, lawyer Karina Moskalenko said in radio comments.
Moskalenko said she was approached by officials after passing check-in and asked to have her baggage examined again. 
After the lawyer asked about the reason for the request, prosecutors told her to sign a non-disclosure pledge about a criminal case she said she knew nothing about, Moskalenko said in comments broadcast on Moscow Echo radio.
Moskalenko said she signed, though it was done under pressure, and illegal to boot, and suggested that the act was linked to the brief detention of Khodorkovsky's lawyers in Moscow airport Sunday.
Prosecutors Monday announced new charges of money laundering and embezzlement against Khodorkovsky and his former associate Platon Lebedev.
Once Russia's richest man, Khodorkovsky is serving an eight-year prison sentence in a Siberian camp near the Chinese border after being convicted in May 2005 for embezzlement and other financial crimes.
Yukos, the oil firm Khodorkovsky built up, has since been dismembered by the Russian courts. 
The case was seen by Kremlin critics as a politically-driven attack against an ambitious businessman who had become critical of President Vladimir Putin.
A Pakistan Air Force Mirage fighter jet crashed Wednesday in central Pakistan but the pilot ejected safely, the air force said.
There were no casualties on the ground after the jet crashed near the city of Jhang, 270 kilometres (168 miles) southwest of Islamabad, said spokesman Air Commodore Sarfraz Ahmed Khan. 
He said the the jet was on a routine training mission and crashed due to a technical malfunction.
Pakistan's air force fleet includes US-built F-16s, French-built Mirages and Chinese fighter jets.
Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi reshuffled his cabinet on Wednesday, sacking three ministers as the government seeks to reinsert its authority in the chaotic nation since a New Year war ousted rival Islamists.
A government statement said Health Minister Abdiaziz Sheikh Yusuf, Higher Education & Culture Minister Hussein Mohamud Sheikh Hussein and Mineral & Water Resources Minister Mohamud Salad Nuur had been relieved from their positions.
There were 10 changes made in total in the reshuffle, including that of Interior Minister Hussein Mohamed Farah Aideed who now takes on the public works portfolio.
A suicide bomber Tuesday night fired his way towards the VIP lounge of the international airport here injuring five security personnel before he was blown up in a grenade explosion in his hand.
Initial reports said that the bomber had aimed at Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz who flew in from Gwader, a small port in Balochistan province, about half an hour before the incident.
However, security officials said Aziz arrived at the nearby Chaklala airbase and the suicide attack was aimed spreading panic as it followed five such strikes in Islamabad and other parts of Pakistan in the last two weeks, security officials said.
Police officials said the well armed bomber, who approached the entrance of the VIP Lounge of the airport, tried to force his way firing at the security personnel.
The bomber tried to hurl a grenade which exploded right at his feet killing him on the spot. 
US envoy Christopher Hill headed Wednesday for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear programmes sounding cautiously upbeat about achieving progress.
A big question is whether the North Koreans are really ready to make some progress, Hill told reporters as he left Tokyo for the six-way talks in Beijing.
In preparing for the new round, which will begin Thursday, Hill held a rare direct meeting with North Korean negotiator Kim Kye-Gwan in Berlin in January.
We did have some good signs in Berlin. 
I think we also know that there is going to be rather hard bargaining. So let's see how we do, Hill said.
The talks group the two Koreas, China, Russia, Japan and the United States.
In Tokyo, Hill said he hoped the Beijing talks would lead to concrete steps to implement a September 2005 deal under which the North agreed to scrap its nuclear weapons in exchange for energy and economic aid.
Hill said the negotiations could cover economic incentives. 
A Japanese press report said North Korea was demanding oil shipments to shut down a reactor.
North Korea walked away from the six-way talks just two months after the 2005 deal to protest US financial sanctions on a Macau bank accused of handling counterfeit money for the North.
North Korea only returned to the table in December 2006. 
In the meantime it had tested an atom bomb for the first time.
The December round produced little of substance, with an emboldened Pyongyang insisting on discussing the financial sanctions.
The US administration has said both India and Pakistan have interest in stability and prosperity of Afghanistan.
US spokesman Sean McCormack, in response to a question on infiltration in Afghanistan said it was not just Pakistan but the region as a whole including India has an interest in the stability and prosperity of Afghanistan.
Pakistan has an interest in a stable, prosperous, democratic Afghanistan. 
The rest of the region you point out India. 
The rest of the region has an interest in that as well. 
And clearly the rest of the world does as well, he said.
Terrorism across the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan is still a problem and an issue that the governments in both Kabul and Islamabad are quite aware of, he said stressing that the issue of stability in that part of the world means having to address infiltration going both ways by the Taliban.
It's still a problem McCormack said talking of cross border terrorism on the Afghan-Pakistan borders.
And the Afghan Government knows it, the Pakistani Government knows it, and we have been involved and continue to be involved with both governments. 
We have a trilateral commission that is set up to improve the communications between the two governments as well as to improve the effectiveness of their efforts to stop cross-border infiltrations going both ways, he added.
He said both Pakistan and Afghanistan have responsibilities in this regard.
They have improved their coordination. 
They have improved somewhat the effectiveness of that coordination, but there is clearly a lot more that needs to be done McCormack said.
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Masayoshi Hamada said Tuesday an international convention banning states from abducting people will spur Japanese moves to resolve North Korea's decades-old abductions of Japanese nationals and send a strong message to Pyongyang.
We were able to send a strong message that it's not only Japan that is telling North Korea about the abduction issue, Hamada told reporters after a ceremony in which 57 countries including Japan signed the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
The treaty is the first of its kind that focuses on state-sponsored abductions.
It will be put into force once 20 nations ratify it.
But the pact does not apply to cases that took place before its ratification, exempting North Korea's abductions of Japanese nationals in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Nevertheless, Hamada stressed, There is significance in that we were able to send a message that many countries regard (abduction) as a crime.
The North Korean side may think that it is only Japan that is related to the abduction issue, but that's not right, he said.
The pact stipulates as a punishable crime an enforced disappearance perpetrated by people or groups of people acting with the authorization or support of a state. 
A woman was injured on Wednesday in an explosion at Britain's vehicle licensing agency, the third attack in three days on motoring-related agencies or companies.
Police refused to confirm the nature of the explosion, but the BBC News reported that a parcel bomb had exploded at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea, Wales.
One female has been taken to hospital with injuries, which are not believed to be life-threatening, a police statement said. A cordon has been put in place and nearby residents are being evacuated as a precautionary measure.
DVLA said the injured woman dealt with the company's mail.
A letter bomb exploded at a business centre in Berkshire, southern England, on Tuesday at the office of Vantis, a business services firm, injuring two men.
Newspapers reported that the letter was addressed to Speed Check Services which supplies speed cameras to the police but was sent instead to its accountants.
On Monday, a woman was injured in a letter bomb explosion at the London headquarters of Capita, the firm managing London's congestion charge. 
The company collects 25 million payments a year from motorists who pay to drive into central London.
A Rome judge on Wednesday ordered a U.S. soldier to stand trial on homicide charges for shooting dead an Italian intelligence agent in Iraq in 2005 as he was escorting a newly freed hostage to safety, prosecutors said.
Mario Lozano of the U.S. Army's 69th Infantry Regiment was charged with voluntary homicide for shooting Nicola Calipari at a checkpoint near Baghdad airport. 
He was also charged with two counts of attempted homicide one for the other Italian agent driving the vehicle and the second for the freed hostage inside.
Prosecutors said the trial will begin on April 17.
Pakistan will close four large refugee camps this year near the Afghan border as part of efforts to check the cross-border movement of militants, officials said Wednesday.
The agreement was reached at a meeting of Pakistani Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions Sardar Yar Mohammad Rind, Afghan Refugee Minister Ustad Mohammad Akbar, and Guenet Guebre Christos, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees representative for Pakistan.
We understand that security near the border is a top priority and stress that refugee camps must retain their civilian nature, Christos told a joint press conference.
The camps to be closed down are Katchi Garhi and Jalozai in the North-West Frontier Province and Girdi Jungle and Jungle Piralizai in Baluchistan, the UNHCR said.
The refugees would have the option to either return to Afghanistan or relocate to other camps in Pakistan.
Nearly 2.4 million Afghan refugees are living in 44 refugee camps in Pakistan.
The four camps to be closed are suspected of providing hiding grounds for militants because of their size and congestion.
Pakistan has been urging the Afghan government to create conditions in Afghanistan which facilitate the voluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland.
Rind said that every refugee returning to Afghan would be given $60 and estimated that total repatriation of Afghan refugees would cost nearly $100 million.
Akbar said the Afghan government was in the process of establishing 50 townships in 29 provinces for the returnees and planned to construct 100 such townships
Two people were killed when ongoing protests in southern Nepal took a violent turn Wednesday and protesters clashed with police, media reports said.
Protesters demanding electoral reform before the country holds a key election under the peace process shot arrows at police officers, triggering a clash in Biratnagar, the hometown of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
The police responded by opening fire, killing two protesters, the reports said, adding that about three dozen others, including nine policemen, were injured in the clash.
The police were trying to prevent the protesters from marching to the local government office in the town in defiance of a curfew order.
The constituent assembly election is planned for mid-June, but southerners have demanded a proportional representation system and the delineation of electoral constituencies based on population. 
They have also demanded a federal state structure before the election.
The protests began in mid-January after the southerners denounced an interim constitution promulgated by the government to elect the assembly, saying it failed to accommodate their demands.
The National Human Rights Commission said Wednesday that 27 people have been killed in the ongoing unrest in southern Nepal.
Nuclear negotiators of North Korea and the United States signed a memorandum last month when they met in Berlin that covered initial steps for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, the Asahi Shimbun reported Thursday in its online edition.
Citing U.S. and North Korean sources, the report said the memorandum called for simultaneous measures, such as Pyongyang closing its nuclear reactor and the United States starting energy and humanitarian aid. 
It was signed by North Korean envoy Kim Kye Gwan and Christopher Hill, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
Discussions at the six-party talks, which will resume Thursday in Beijing, are likely to be based on this memorandum, the report said.
The report said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei, who presides over the multilateral talks, has been given a copy of the memorandum from Hill and also has been briefed about it by Kim.
In the memorandum, North Korea said it will stop the graphite-moderated nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and accept nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, while the United States expressed support for energy and humanitarian aid, it said.
The six-party talks were last held in December after a 13-month hiatus, but progress was blocked by a dispute over U.S. financial sanctions on a Macao-based bank suspected of laundering money for North Korea.
The U.S. restrictions on Banco Delta Asia SARL have been Pyongyang's main complaint over the past year, but the United States reiterated these were law enforcement issues.
But after his Berlin meeting with Hill, Kim expressed satisfaction, saying.
There was a positive change in the attitude of the United States
The Lebanese army fired shots late Wednesday at Israeli troops across the border in Israel in the first such incident since the end of the war last summer, causing no injuries, the Israeli army and a Lebanese security source said.
The incident was sparked by Israeli sappers moving in to clear unexploded ordnance just across the border. 
They withdrew early Thursday after completing their mission, the Israeli army said.
The Lebanese army first fired warning shots.
We asked them through UNIFIL (the United Nations force in Lebanon) to stop shooting. 
Shots were fired in the direction of our forces, an Israeli army spokesman told AFP.
We retaliated in the direction of the shots. 
Our forces had no injuries.
The firing has now finished and we consider the incident closed, he added.
A Lebanese security source confirmed that the Lebanese army had fired on Israeli troops close to the border.
The Lebanese army fired on an Israeli bulldozer that was trying to advance towards the central sector of southern Lebanon near the village of Yaroun, the source said, without giving further details.
Israeli aircraft overflew the eastern sector of the border where the incident took place, public television reported. 
The area was lit up intermittently by flares.
The shooting was the first armed incident at the Israeli-Lebanese border since Israeli troops withdrew from Lebanon in October, after fighting a devastating 34-day war against Shiite militant group Hezbollah last summer.
Security sources earlier Wednesday said Lebanese troops were on high alert after Israeli sappers moved to clear unexploded ordnance just across the border.
Two Israeli demining vehicles accompanied by Merkava tanks were seen approaching the border near the village of Yaroun, south of the town of Bint Jbeil, prompting the Lebanese army to deploy troop reinforcements, the sources said.
An Israeli military spokesman said the sappers were clearing a zone in which four unexploded bombs had been found on the Israeli side on Monday.
Israeli officials charged that the bombs had been recently planted by Hezbollah.
But Hezbollah insisted Tuesday that they dated from before the conflict, which ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire in August.
A beefed-up UN peacekeeping force is patrolling the volatile border area along with Lebanese soldiers under the terms of the truce.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Tuesday that he expected a three-way summit with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to take place on February 19.
In a few days, on the 19th, I hope to have a trilateral meeting with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and chairman of the Palestinian Authority Abu Mazen (Abbas), he said in a speech to American Jewish leaders.
I hope that by then we will not find that Abu Mazen has partnered with Hamas in a way that is in contradiction of the principles of the quartet and the international community, he added.
Abbas is in Saudi Arabia for crisis talks with Khaled Meshaal, the political supremo of Hamas, which Israel blacklists as a terrorist organisation, in a bid to broker a power-sharing agreement after deadly inter-Palestinian fighting.
But Olmert did not specify where the much anticipated trilateral summit.
Which Rice said on a tour of the Middle East in mid-January would take place in three to four weeks time would be held.
Washington has billed the prospective summit as the premiere for a US-led new peace drive, although observers have pointed to limited chances of success owing to political weaknesses facing both Abbas and Olmert.
At talks in Washington last Friday, the four international sponsors of the stalled Middle East process endorsed a US plan to accelerate steps towards creating the Palestinians' promised future state.
The group supported Rice's new approach to strengthen the ability of Abbas to govern and ensure security while holding parallel talks on critical final status issues like borders and the future of Jerusalem.
There is simply no reason to avoid the subject of how we get to a Palestinian state, Rice declared.
Abbas has been locked in a power struggle with the powerful Hamas since the Islamists thrashed his secular Fatah party at parliamentary elections in 2006.
Olmert is also facing rock-bottom approval ratings in Israel over his perceived mismanagement of last year's war in Lebanon and a string of scandals dogging his nine-month administration.
Hakim al-Zamili, deputy secretary at the Iraqi health minstry, was arrested Thursday by a joint Iraqi-US force in Baghdad, the ministry's spokesman said.
Joint Iraqi-US forces broke into the health ministry building and arrested the deputy secretary Hakim al-Zamili for an unknown reason, spokesman Qassim Allawi said.
Delegates from six nations on Thursday reopened negotiations on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, as host nation China said it was taking an open attitude to the duration and content of the talks.
North Korean envoy Kim Kye Gwan said Pyongyang was ready to reopen talks on its nuclear programme but said any progress would depend on the United States dropping its hostile policy towards North Korea.
We first plan to determine whether the US is trying to abandon its hostile policy against us and come to peaceful coexistence or not, South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Kim as saying as he arrived at Beijing's Capital Airport on Thursday.
Kim said North Korea would discuss early steps in implementing a joint statement of principles for ending the nuclear programme, which was issued by the six nations in September 2005. 
The main purpose (of this week's talks) is to discuss the implementation of the initial phase of the September 19 agreement, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told reporters. 
The chief negotiators held an initial meeting on Thursday afternoon and were scheduled to move into a plenary session of the six delegations later in the day, Chinese officials said. 
Several informal bilateral sessions were also expected to be held on Thursday, with unconfirmed reports saying that Kim may meet US chief negotiator Christopher Hill.
As he arrived on Wednesday, Hill said the talks could only be deemed successful once the six nations implemented the joint statement.
So we are not going to finish that (implementation) this week, he told reporters. 
We will maybe just make a good first step.
Sources told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa that Kim and Hill narrowed their differences during bilateral talks in Berlin last month, and that the two sides may continue gradual progress towards a detailed agreement this week.
North Korea was prepared to shut down its nuclear reactor and fuel programme if it gained US concessions in energy and economic assistance, a source familiar with the Berlin talks said.
In connection with energy deliveries from the US side, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors would be let into the country, the source said.
North Korean officials showed their readiness to reciprocate after the US raised the possibility of eliminating trade barriers and removing North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. 
There was a significant narrowing between the American and North Korean positions, the source said.
North Korea is reportedly negotiating for some 500,000 tons of fuel oil in exchange for suspending operation of a Yongbyon nuclear reactor and agreeing to IAEA inspections, according to Japanese media.
Pyongyang's initial steps to implement the September 2005 joint statement is only likely to include freezing the Yongbyon facilities, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted former US State Department official Joel Wit as saying.
Wit met Kim and other officials during a visit to North Korea in late January, the newspaper said.
The Osaka municipal government said Thursday it will propose an ordinance to ban street smoking and slap violators with a 1,000 yen fine during an assembly session that begins Feb. 16.
Similar ordinances have been implemented in many areas in Tokyo and in other densely populated places.
The city plans to designate no-smoking zones in July, and will begin fining violators from October. Candidates for the zones include Midosuji, the city's main street. The ordinance will be enforced through routine patrols by commissioned private individuals.
The proposed ordinance calls for setting up a mayoral advisory panel of experts to make recommendations, including which places to designate as no-smoking zones.  
Joint US-Iraqi forces seized Deputy Health Minister Hazem al-Zamli at the ministry on Thursday in a politically-charged raid aimed at terrorists and militias operating in Baghdad.
The Health Ministry is regarded as a haven for Shiite militias, with both al-Zamli and his boss, Health Minister Ali al-Shemari, members of the movement of radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.
In a statement, the US military alleged that al-Zamli was involved in the murder of seven ministry officials.
It also said he had taken bribe money and funnelled millions of dollars to Sadr's militias, known as the Mahdi army, which is suspected of having entered state clinics and killed Sunni patients and their relatives and intimidated doctors.
Al-Shemari reacted to the raid and seizure of his deputy by demanding his immediate release.
Al-Zamli was detained in an uncivilized way, he charged.
Analysts saw the US action at the Health Ministry as part of the new get-tough strategy to try to boost security in the Iraqi capital. 
On Wednesday, American officers had said the process would be one of many small individual steps and not a major offensive.
The raid came as meanwhile Defence Minister Abdelkader Mohammed Jazeem was being questioned behind closed doors in parliament.
Sunni deputies in parliament had requested the session with the defence minister, amid demands made by their Islamic Party of the government finally to take action against the militias who were operating under the cover of the security forces.
The Sunnis have also acused the US military of allowing the militias to operate.
Meanwhile in further bloodshed in the strife-torn country, at least 33 Iraqis were killed and 58 wounded in a series of blasts across Iraq over a 24-hour period, sources said Thursday.
Authorities Thursday confiscated a truck loaded with arms in an area on the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanese Information Minister Ghazi Aridi said.
The army has seized a truck loaded with weapons in Hamzmieh, 12 kilometres, east of Beirut, the minister said after a regular cabinet meeting.
The truck was coming from the Bekaa Valley, the minister said without elaborating.
Aridi refused to give details but said the Lebanese customs department have taken the truck to Beirut port and investigations are under way to find out to which group the weapons belong to.
Lebanese security sources told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa that the truck is loaded with machineguns and pistols.
The sources said the Lebanese customs department received a tip that a truck was heading with weapons to the capital Beirut.
On February 4, the official Syrian news agency (SANA) said Syrian custom officers seized an Iraqi truck transporting light weapons bound for Lebanon.
Hezbollah was the only armed group which was not asked to lay down their arms after the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, because it was considered a resistance movement fighting against an occupying force (Israel).
In 2004 UN Security Council Resolution 1559 ca1led for the disarming of all militias in Lebanon.
An international air show in southern India was disrupted Thursday after a plane burst a tyre and skidded off the runway, a spokesman said.
Flight demonstrations at Bangalore's Yelahanka air base resumed after a 30-minute delay because of the accident, which left no casualties, said M. Anantakrishnan, a spokesman for Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., manufacturer of the Indian Jet Trainer aircraft.
The tyre burst just short of takeoff, he told AFP. 
The pilot walked away safely.
Announcements via loudhailer asked spectators to avoid panic as a rescue team rushed to the site, which was soon cleared, witnesses said.
More than 500 foreign and Indian companies are taking part in the five-day air show, which features some of the most sophisticated military and passenger planes and related technologies. 
The five-day show began Wednesday.
University students and professors held mass demonstrations across Greece on Thursday, protesting against reforms planned by the conservative government.
Riot police, preparing for violence, closed off Athens' city centre for hours as thousands of protestors marched through the Greek capital towards parliament.
A day earlier in the northern port city of Thessaloniki, riot police fired tear gas at hundreds of demonstrators.
Students are opposed to government reforms to allow privately run universities to operate and university professors announced a 48-hour stoppage starting Thursday.
The wide-range discontent has forced the closure of hundreds of university departments.
Private tertiary education institutions are banned from operating in Greece and the conservative government believes the new law, allowing for the operation of private universities, would lead to greater competitiveness and higher educational standards.
Teachers, students and union leaders insist the government should upgrade free public education instead and fear the move could lead to higher education costs and lower teaching standards.
Educators accuse the government of failing to keep one of its main pre-election promises of hiking education funding to 5 per cent of GDP from a current 3.5 per cent.
Greece's parliament is expected to vote in March on the measures which would require a constitutional amendment.
U.N. and Liberian police fired tear gas on Thursday to disperse hundreds of rioting former soldiers who were protesting against arrears in the payment of demobilisation packages, witnesses said.
At least four of the ex-combatants were arrested in the riot which brought chaos to the northern Paynesville district of Monrovia, the seaside capital of Africa's oldest republic which was established by freed slaves from America in 1847.
Shops and businesses were shut and the road intersection leading to the country's international airport was briefly closed.
The former soldiers, some of whom veterans of Liberia's 1989-2003 civil war, stormed into the compound of the national state radio building, where shortly earlier President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf had addressed journalists.
Chanting war songs, they said they wanted to present to her their complaints about the delayed severance payments, but she had already left the state radio premises.
We wanted to meet the president. 
We do not think this is the right way for this government to treat us. We worked for this country for many years and up to now, nothing has been done for us, one of the protesters, ex-Lieutenant Amos Kollie, said.
We have families that we need to take care of, another protester, former Master Sergeant Jacob Toe, said.
Jordanian peacekeepers from the United Nations Military Mission in Liberia and Liberian police fired tear gas canisters to break up the demonstration. 
Two U.N. armoured personnel carriers patrolled the streets.
No injuries were reported but witnesses saw at least one police officer being beaten with a stick by protesters, whom police said were also armed with knives.
Since Johnson-Sirleaf took office as Africa's first elected female head of state early last year, she has faced several protests from former members of the old Armed Forces of Liberia.
Thousands of ex-combatants have been demobilised and paid off to make way for a new, slimmed-down Liberian armed forces, the first unit of which graduated in November after training by a U.S. defence contractor, DynCorp International.
The US envoy to six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme called Friday for quick progress, after China issued a draft accord that seeks to begin the disarmament process.
This is just the first step. 
We would like to pick up the pace,  Christopher Hill said when asked about the Chinese proposal distributed overnight to participants in the negotiations in Beijing.
Hill described the draft accord, which press reports said was based on proposals put forward by all six-party members on the first day of fresh negotiations on Thursday, as a very tough first step.
Hill said he had not seen the exact details of the draft accord, but that they would be the subject of in-depth discussions during Friday's second day of talks.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that it involved North Korea committing to freeze nuclear weapons-related facilities within two months in exchange for alternative energy sources.
The facilities to be shut down include its five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and a radiochemical laboratory, Yonhap reported, citing unidentified but multiple sources.
The six-party forum, which started in 2003 with the aim of halting North Korea's nuclear ambitions, involves host China, the two Koreas, South Korea, the United States and Japan.
A South Korean official involved in the talks said the draft referred to initial steps they could take to begin implementing a deal made in September 2005 to end North Korea's nuclear programme.
Under that deal, North Korea promised to abandon its nuclear programme in return for security guarantees, energy aid and other benefits.
However, it fell apart two months after it was signed amid North Korean protests over unrelated US sanctions imposed against the regime for alleged money laundering and counterfeiting.
Three foreigners were reported kidnapped in the Niger Delta, a day after the release of a US hostage, a police spokesman said Monday.
The men were kidnapped in the harbour city of Port Harcourt.
Unconfirmed reports said the men were Croatian.
The kidnapping follows the release Sunday night of a US engineer and his Nigerian driver.
It was not known if any ransom was paid to secure their release.
At present, eight other foreigners are being held captive in the region, including two Italians and a French national.
Most victims are released once a ransom is paid. 
Some kidnappings are politically motivated and in protest at the living conditions in impoverished Niger Delta, while others are purely for financial gain.
A suicide bomber attacked a US outpost north of Baghdad on Monday, detonating an explosives-laden vehicle that killed two American soldiers and wounded 17 more, the military said.
An Iraqi security official told AFP the attack was carried out against an American base in Tarmiyah, 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of the capital.
Insurgents initiated the attack on the outpost with a suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device detonation, the US statement said. 
The attack site has been secured and wounded soldiers have been evacuated.
The deaths brought the number of US servicemen and women to have died in the Iraqi campaign since the March 2003 invasion to 3,132, according to an AFP tally based on Pentagon figures.
Suicide car bombs are a hallmark of Iraq's Sunni-led insurgency and are often used in attacks on US patrols and Iraqi troops and civilians. 
It is rare, however, for bombers to be able to strike fixed American positions.
The attack came as thousands of US and Iraqi troops continued a massive security operation in nearby Baghdad, where they are attempting to quell a sectarian war between rival Sunni and Shiite factions.
Two bombs exploded on board a train bound from India to Pakistan, sparking a fire that killed at least 66 passengers on Monday, in an apparent attempt to sabotage a peace process between the nuclear-armed rivals.
Most of the victims were Pakistanis, but some Indians and hree railway policemen died in the attack, officials said.
Bodies were laid out in blue bags between huge slabs of melting ice in a morgue in the nearby town of Panipat. 
Officials said about 30 of the bodies were charred beyond recognition.
I have been working here for 25 years and I have never seen anything like this, said nurse Rohtas Singh. 
Some bodies don't have legs, some don't have arms, some have no faces. 
Some you can't even make out if they are men or women.
About half a dozen of the corpses were of children.
Two unexploded suitcase bombs were also found on the train. 
Inside one, an electronic timer encased in clear plastic was packed next to more than a dozen plastic bottles containing a cocktail of fuel oils and chemicals.
Indian financial markets shrugged off the bombings, with the Mumbai stock market's index ending slightly higher on the day.
One person was detained in connection with the midnight blasts on the train about 80 km (50 miles) north of New Delhi, Railways Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav was quoted as saying.
But there was no finger-pointing by India and Pakistan, as there has been so often in the past after violent attacks.
The prime ministers of the two countries called each other and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said the attack would not be allowed to undermine the two countries' peace efforts.
We will not allow elements which want to sabotage the ongoing peace process to succeed in their nefarious designs, Musharraf said in a statement.
Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, due in New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders to push forward the slow-moving peace process, said his trip would go ahead.
Washington condemned the bombing and those who seek to undermine the progress in relations between the two countries, White House spokesman David Almacy said.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that this heinous crime cannot be justified by any cause and its perpetrators should be brought to justice, according to U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq.
Police said that while the explosions were small, they were intended to cause fires on at least four of the train's coaches.
It's sabotage it's an act of terrorism like the one in Mumbai, Yadav told reporters, referring to serial bomb blasts in India's commercial capital last July that killed 186 people.
Press Trust of India, or PTI, quoted him as saying one person in one of the two coaches that caught fire had been detained.
Black-clad Mexican widows marched through the desert on Monday demanding the bodies of 65 men killed in a coal pit blast a year ago and strikers closed most of the country's mines in solidarity.
Only two bodies have been recovered after the gas explosion that ripped through the Pasta de Conchos coal mine near the Texan border in the early morning of Feb. 19, 2006.
Relatives are angry at not being able to bury their dead and the lack of legal action against Grupo Mexico, Mexico's largest mining company and the owner of Pasta de Conchos.
A group of some 150 widows, relatives and miners marched to the mine along a desert road, dressed in mourning clothes and singing hymns to a lone drummer's beat. 
Crying and shouting, they scuffled with security guards manning the entrance.
A mother never tires of waiting, we want to see the bodies, said Yolanda Ramos, holding up a photograph of her dead son Mario Alberto, 26, at the front of the group.
Buried by thousands of tonnes of rock, many of the bodies may have been incinerated by temperatures soaring to 1,100 degrees F (593 C).
Thousands of unionized workers shut down most of the country's mines and metal plants in a one-day national strike in memory of the dead, hoping to pressure the government to punish Grupo Mexico, said the country's miners' union.
The union said 90 percent of unionized operations were closed, including one of the world's biggest silver mines, owned by mining company Penoles, as well as gold mines and steel and copper plants.
An Iraqi Sunni Muslim woman, 20, accused three Iraqi police officers Monday of raping her, pan-Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera reported.
The victim, who appeared on al-Jazeera with her face veiled, said the incident began when police stormed her house early Sunday in al-Amel district in western Baghdad while her husband was away.
According to the victim, the police accused her of cooking for Sunni insurgents and took her to a police station, where they raped her.
They covered my eye, and I heard one of them saying let's start, the distressed woman said.
One of the officers took photographs during the rape and threatened her with murder if she reported the rape. 
The woman said that a neighbour alerted US soldiers about the attack, and she was released.
Christopher Garver, a US military spokesman, told al-Jazeera that he could not confirm any US role in the incident, but said, The US military will support the Iraqi government in its investigation.
Al-Jazeera reported that the woman did not specify that her attackers were Shiite Muslims, though Iraqi Shiites form the majority within the ranks of Baghdad police, especially senior commando units.
The allegation is likely to spur more tension between Sunnis and Shiites as Iraqi-US joint forces have been attempting for the seventh day to enforce a crackdown in the capital, as part of a new Iraqi security plan.
Iraqi Deputy Interior Minister Hussein Ali Kamel rejected the allegation: Something like this could not happen, because Iraqi forces are operating with US forces all the time.
By God, if you don't bring justice to this Muslim Iraqi woman, history will curse us with eternal disgrace, Sunni Iraqi Parliament speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani told al-Jazeera.
Colombia's foreign minister Maria Consuelo Araujo resigned abruptly on Monday, days after her brother, a senator, was arrested for allegedly funding right-wing paramilitary squads.
Iran may be able to enrich uranium on a mass scale in just six months, but it could still be 10 years away from the capacity to build a nuclear bomb, the chief UN monitor said in remarks published Monday.
Mohamed ElBaradei, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told the Financial Times that Iran has since August been using centrifuges at a pilot plant in the town of Natanz to enrich uranium.
The UN watchdog believes that Iran could set up an industrial scale capacity of 3,000 centrifuges within the next 12 months. 
That would be enough to begin producing fissile material for a bomb.
It could be six months, it could be a year, ElBaradei said in an interview in the newspaper's Tuesday edition.
ElBaradei added that Tehran had learned so much from its pilot programme that it would be impossible to turn the clock back.
Although fears that Tehran might learn enough about uranium enrichment may have been relevant six months ago, it is not relevant today because Iran has been running these centrifuges for at least six months, ElBaradei said.
Uranium is enriched to be civilian reactor fuel but can also make the explosive core of atom bombs.
The UN Security Council imposed sanctions in December to force Iran to halt all enrichment work. 
Iran is expected to be unlikely to meet a UN deadline Wednesday to suspend enrichment.
However, ElBaradei sought to dispel any alarm.
There's a big difference between acquiring the knowledge for enrichment and developing a bomb, he was quoted as saying.
He added that, according to US and British intelligence estimates, Iran was still five to 10 years away from building a nuclear bomb, and warned against hype over Tehran's nuclear progress.
ElBaradei is set to meet Iran's nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani in Vienna on Tuesday amid spiralling tensions over the Iranian nuclear programme.
Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee ended a day-long official visit to Bangladesh Monday with both neighbours pledging to strengthen bilateral ties, diplomatic sources said.
Mukherjee's main mission in Dhaka was to hand over to Bangladeshi government leaders letters of invitation to New Delhi for the upcoming summit of South Asian countries.
Sources said Mukherjee discussed however relations between India and Bangladesh during meetings with Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed and the head of the country's current caretaker government Fakhruddin Ahmed.
India is hosting the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) on April 3-4, the 14th such meeting of the SAARC countries since the regional forum was launched in 1985.
The SAARC started with Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Afghanistan and Myanmar are likely to join the summit as the newly admitted members of the extended SAARC family.
US Vice President Dick Cheney headed to Asia on Tuesday with his first scheduled stop in Japan, a key US ally which has voiced increasing concern about the White House's approach on North Korea and Iraq.
Cheney will also travel to Australia and the US Pacific territory of Guam on a trip that comes on the heels of a breakthrough deal on North Korea and plans to deploy more than 20,000 extra US troops to insurgency-plagued Iraq.
The vice president will take pains to thank Japan and Australia for their help in Iraq and Afghanistan and may urge them to consider ways to beef up their presence in both war-torn countries, a senior US official said.
We will talk about where there are places where we need to have more done, what other contributions we and other countries can make to the efforts of both those conflicts, the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
In Tokyo, Cheney will aim to dispel any worries about the North Korean deal, emphasising that it is only a good first step towards stripping the regime of its nuclear weapons programmes, he said.
Japan has refused to fund the deal, under which North Korea would receive badly needed fuel aid, due to an emotionally charged row over Pyongyang's past abductions of Japanese citizens.
I think it's reasonable to expect very serious discussions on North Korea and also some other issues that we are jointly faced with, a senior Japanese official who declined to be named said ahead of Cheney's visit.
On Wednesday, the US vice president will meet with top leaders including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and have an audience with Japan's emperor and empress.
Cheney will not, however, meet with Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma, who last month sharply criticized the decision to invade Iraq. A US official said Cheney's schedule was locked in place before Kyuma requested a meeting.
Officially pacifist Japan took the landmark step of sending troops to Iraq on a non-combat mission but former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi withdrew them before handing over power to Abe in September.
The Japanese official downplayed disagreements between the allies, saying Abe had reiterated support for US policy and the determination of his government to carry out various measures of cooperation.
But a poll carried Tuesday by the Asahi Shimbun showed that 57 percent of Japanese shared Kyuma's view that President George W. Bush was wrong to invade Iraq.
An overwhelming 81 percent backed Abe in refusing to fund the North Korea deal, with only 11 percent expressing opposition, said the liberal newspaper's poll of 1,940 voters.
Cheney will meet Friday with Australian opposition leader Kevin Rudd -- at Rudd's request, the US official said. 
Rudd has said his Labor Party would not back any increase in the number of Australian troops in Iraq, even military trainers.
However, Prime Minister John Howard said Monday Australia might send up to 70 additional military instructors to Iraq and deploy more troops in Afghanistan.
Cheney will meet on Saturday with Howard, who has complained about US handling of the country's sole terror suspect jailed at Guantanamo Bay, David Hicks, the so-called Australian Taliban.
Most Japanese are disappointed with the six-way deal on North Korea's nuclear programme and an overwhelming majority back the government's refusal to fund it, a survey said Tuesday.
Five countries including Japan struck a deal with North Korea last week under which Pyongyang will shut down key nuclear facilities within two months in exchange for badly needed fuel.
But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe insists that Japan will not provide aid to the nuclear-armed regime unless there is progress in a dispute over its past abductions of Japanese civilians.
Fifty-six percent of Japanese said that the nuclear deal did not meet their expectations, while 31 percent welcomed it, said the poll by the Asahi Shimbun. 
The rest were undecided or gave other opinions.
The poll showed 81 percent backed Abe's stance against funding the deal, with 11 percent expressing opposition.
The liberal daily carried out the telephone survey on Saturday and Sunday across the nation with 1,940 eligible voters giving valid responses.
North Korea admitted in 2002 it had kidnapped Japanese civilians to train its spies in the 1970s and 1980s. 
It returned five victims and their families and declared the others dead, but Japan says more are alive and being kept under wraps.
Abe built his career campaigning on the issue, which rouses deep emotion in Japan. His government has rejected criticism that Japan was isolating itself within the six-way talks which include Tokyo's main ally, the United States.
The nuclear accord calls for Japan and North Korea to hold talks on their tense relations, but Abe said more action was needed.
A statement issued by the Bahraini Interior Ministry late Monday to local press claimed that confessions obtained following recent arrests had uncovered a clandestine operation to destabilize Bahrainf and undermine its security.
According to the statement, 35 youths aged 20 to 25 had trained to use Molotov cocktails on a farm in the Shiite Muslim village of Bani Jamrah, west of the capital Manama.
Colonel Adel al-Fadel, head of the Northern Security Directorate, was quoted by the statement as saying that two defendants confessed to their crimes before the Public Prosecutor.
The arrests disclosed to the security forces important details about how recruiting and training of some young people had been carried out to achieve long-term goals with the aim of destabilizing the country security, he said.
Al-Fadel said that the first defendant, a resident of the Shiite village of Karanah, was apprehended in possession of a Molotov cocktail before attacking police during a riot in the village of Bani Jamrah.
The confessions of the first defendant led to the arrest of the second defendant, identified in the statement only as a resident of the village of Abu Saiba.
The first defendant said that the second defendant took him to a farm in Bani Jamrah, where a masked person trained them in a group of 35 youths in the use of Molotov cocktails against police, al-Fadel said.
He reported that the training on the farm had been carried out on dates set in a precise manner.
Al-Fadel said that the first defendant led authorities to the farm, where they discovered a neatly organized box full of empty bottles.
The second defendant, according to the statement, also confessed to his involvement in riots, vandalism and arson but denied accompanying the first defendant to the alleged training farm.
The Shiite village of Abu Saiba had witnessed it third straight night of unrest with clashes late Monday between protesters and police over the arrest of village resident Radhi Ali Radhi, who was detained following a morning raid Saturday on his home.
The detention of Radhi, who is in his early 20s, led relatives and friends to organize a protest the same day in front of the village entrance to demand his release.
His family had tried to see him at the police station, but they were turned away without being given a reason for his arrest.
Both police and protesters exchanged blame for the clashes, with protesters pointing out that their demonstrations were peaceful rallies to demand Radis release.
While police accused the protesters of holding illegal protests.
According to al-Fadel, the evidence confirmed to security agencies that the acts of vandalism that took place recently were part of a scheme to destabilize Bahrain and were not spontaneous reactions.
Three U.N. cars were damaged in an explosion in a residential area of the Kosovo capital Pristina on Monday.
But no one was hurt, witnesses said.
We are checking what happened, a police spokesman said.
A police source said it appeared an explosive device had been placed under one of the cars.
Twenty unidentified bodies were found in Baghdad on Monday, Iraqi police said on Tuesday, a spike in the daily death toll after a marked reduction since the start of a major security crackdown.
Most such bodies are victims of sectarian death squads andmany are found tortured, bound and shot dead. 
The figure from the morgue does not include victims of bomb attacks or others who are taken to hospitals and identified there.   
The U.S.-led offensive against militants had sharply reduced the number of death squad killings in Baghdad since the operation formally began a week ago.
Before the crackdown, police had been finding 40 to 50 bodies a day. 
U.S. generals, mindful of the failure of similar crackdowns last year, have warned that militants are likely to adapt their tactics and perhaps lie low initially.
On Sunday, they found just three bodies and in previous days around five each day.
A truck exploded near a restaurant in a town just north of Baghdad on Tuesday, killing five people and wounding 75, police said.
Police said the blast in Taji, 20 km (12 miles) from the capital, might have been a bomb attack but they were also investigating whether it could have been an accident.
They initially said the truck was carrying liquid natural gas but later said it was chlorine. 
Police said preliminary reports were of five dead.
South Korea's deputy foreign minister  headed to Washington on Tuesday for talks with US officials on ways to follow up on last week's deal on scrapping North Korea's nuclear programme, his ministry said.
Shim Yoon-Joe was to hold talks with US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns during his visit from Tuesday to Saturday, the ministry said.
He would also meet other officials including John C. Rood, assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, and Jack D. Crouch II, deputy national security advisor.
At six-nation talks in Beijing last week, North Korea agreed to start disabling its nuclear facilities in exchange for badly-needed energy aid.
As a first step it will shut down and seal its Yongbyon reactor within 60 days, admit UN nuclear inspectors and receive 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil or equivalent assistance in return. 
Further steps to disable nuclear facilities would be rewarded with up to 950,000 tons of heavy oil or other aid.
Critics say the deal does not address the North's existing weapons or plutonium stockpile, or its suspected uranium-based weapons research programme. 
The agreement is the first step in a long series that includes the complete renunciation of nuclear weaponry and facilities within North Korea, White House spokesman Tony Snow said Sunday.
If they are going to get the benefits down the road including ultimately as much as a million tons of heavy oil, they've got to perform.
Seoul officials point out that the North must eventually submit a list of its nuclear facilities and programmes, including any uranium-based one.
Shim's US trip precedes a planned visit by South Korea's Foreign Minister Song Min-Soon early next month, Yonhap news agency said.
Right-wing Israeli-Russian billionaire Arkady Gaydamak said on Tuesday he planned to create a new political party to focus exclusively on socio-economic issues. 
I intend to create a new party within one month after having examined all the bureaucratic procedures, Gaydamak told AFP. 
The state of Israel is passing through a major crisis because it is being managed by some inefficient people.
As an Israeli citizen I consider this my duty, he added. 
I have certain experience in political, economic and social affairs. 
Gaydamak, a long time ally of right-wing Likud party leader and former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said his own polling showed he had broad support from Israel's large Russian minority and could count on between 25 and 30 percent support in a nationwide vote.
In recent weeks Gaydamak and Netanyahu have played up their alliance in the media, and Netanyahu's poll ratings among Russian voters have shot up as a result, according to the Israeli press. 
One of the first Jews to immigrate to Israel from Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union, Gaydamak soon left for France, but fled back to Israel in 2000 amid allegations of Angola gun running and tax evasion.
The billionaire also owns Israeli football team Beitar Jerusalem and basketball side Hapoel Jerusalem.
Among women with no history of major illness, those with high cholesterol levels are significantly more likely to suffer a stroke, investigators in Boston report.
Dr. Tobias Kurth, from Brigham and Women's Hospital, and his associates point out in the medical journal Neurology that most studies looking at cholesterol and stroke have included people who already had heart disease, and excluded women.
To fill in the gaps, Kurth's team analyzed data from the Women's Health Study, which included 28,000 women aged 45 or older when they entered the study between 1992 and 1995. 
None had heart disease, cancer, or other major illnesses at baseline.
During an average follow-up of 11 years, 282 strokes occurred.
Being in the group with the highest level of HDL (good) cholesterol cut the risk of stroke nearly in half, the investigators report.
On the other hand, having the highest level of LDL (bad) cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol roughly doubled the chances of having a stroke, compared with those with the lowest levels.
Our results further underscore the importance of unfavorable lipid levels as risk factors for stroke among apparently healthy individuals without prior vascular disease, Kurth and his colleagues conclude.
The European Parliament eased its own total smoking ban for its buildings in Brussels, opting to allow smoking in designated areas, Belgian news agency Belga reported Monday.
Some officials had been ignoring the ban behind closed doors.
Smoking will now be allowed in certain closed rooms with separate air circulation systems.
The rule was not achievable, a spokeswoman for Hans-Gert Poettering, the parliament's new president, was quoted as saying.
The move comes as the European Union pushes a smoking ban for all public buildings across Europe.
Mortar bombs hit several parts of Mogadishu before dawn on Tuesday, witnesses said, killing at least seven people in one of the fiercest bombardments since an Islamist movement was chased from Somalia's capital last month.
The hilltop presidential palace, Villa Somalia, and the coastal city's defence headquarters were among the targets hit, and hospital sources said dozens of people were wounded.
They showered us with rockets and a mortar also hit the compound. 
Luckily no one was hurt, said a government soldier who was in Villa Somalia during the attack but declined to be named for fear of reprisal.
Our troops and those from our ally Ethiopia were forced to fire heavy artillery, he told Reuters. We had to retaliate.
These elements are being paid to cause all this destruction. 
A woman living nearby said several people were wounded in the surrounding streets, and a Reuters TV cameraman saw five bodies in a western neighbourhood also hit by mortar rounds.
A spate of near-daily rocket and mortar strikes have challenged the government's bid to impose security and let Ethiopian troops who helped it oust the Islamists go home.
Deputy Defence Minister Salad Ali Jelle said two civilians were killed in the attack on the defence headquarters, and he also accused Islamist remnants of paying the assailants.
The insurgents are paying $100 a day to whoever fires rockets and mortars at the government and people, he said.
But Jelle said a 24-hour rapid response paramilitary unit that was unveiled on Monday would soon show results in its fight to stop the wave of guerrilla attacks.
The plan is to expand our control in the city so the extremists are no longer safe anywhere ... We intend to make it very hard for them to continue operating, he said.
With Ethiopian military help, government troops have boosted patrols and set up more checkpoints to help curb the bloodshed.
The attacks underscore the huge challenge facing President Abdullahi Yusuf's government as it tries to tame a nation in anarchy since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991.
His administration says it is doing its best to police one of the world's most dangerous cities with little help.
Pakistani police arrested two suspected suicide bombers from a banned Islamist group on Tuesday and seized explosives and jackets to be used in suicide attacks, police said.
Pakistan has suffered a spate of suicide attacks since mid-January, after an army air strike on militants in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border. 
In the worst attack, 16 people were killed in an blast at a court on Saturday.
Police arrested the pair in the southern city of Hyderabad after a tip-off from three other suspected suicide bombers arrested in the city of Karachi last week.
Senior police officer Ghulam Haider Khoso in Hyderabad said the two suspects were linked with the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen militant group. 
They were arrested with hand grenades, pistols, explosives and jackets, he said.
We've learned that these two guys trained in Wana, Khoso said, referring to the main town in South Waziristan.
Harkat-ul-Mujahideen is fighting Indian rule in the disputed Kashmir region. 
The group also has links with al Qaeda and has been involved in militant attacks in Pakistan.
Separately, police in the capital, Islamabad, arrested two Shi'ite Muslim militants involved in sectarian attacks on rival Sunnis.
Senior city police officer Sikandar Hayat said the two were involved in the killing of a fiery Sunni leader, Azam Tariq, in 2003 and a bombing in the eastern city of Multan in 2004 in which 42 people were killed.
Thousands of people have been killed in sectarian attacks by Sunni and Shi'ite militants in Pakistan since the 1980s. 
Shi'ites make up about 15 percent of the mostly Sunni Muslim country's population.
An American soldier has been killed in fighting in Afghanistan, the U.S. military said on Tuesday, as the Taliban step up attacks at the start of a spring offensive.
The soldier was killed on Monday in the eastern province of Kunar, bordering Pakistan, the U.S. military said in a statement.
It gave no further details of the incident in a province which is a bastion for the Taliban and their Islamic allies.
After several months of a lull in fighting due to the harsh Afghan winter, the Taliban have resumed attacks against government forces and Western troops in the south and east.
More than 4,000 people, a quarter of them civilians, were killed in violence in Afghanistan last year, the bloodiest period since a U.S.-led coalition overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The Taliban say they are gearing up for a spring offensive while the coalition and NATO troops are readying for their own offensive in what analysts say will be a crunch year in the war to quell a strengthening insurgency.
Assailants killed three Salvadoran congressmen, including the son of a civil-war era death squad chief, and left their charred bodies blazing on a Guatemalan back road, authorities said on Tuesday.
Eduardo D'Aubuisson, William Pichinte and Jose Ramon Gonzalez were deputies in the Guatemala-based regional Central American parliament from El Salvador's conservative ruling ARENA party. The remains of a fourth man were found with them.
Villagers discovered their bodies in a blazing car up a dirt track an hour's drive east of Guatemala City, Guatemalan Interior Minister Carlos Vielmann told reporters at the scene.
The deputies had gone missing during an overland trip to Guatemala from neighboring El Salvador. Vielmann said there was no doubt they had been murdered but that there were no clues yet about the motive or the identity of the assailants.
D'Aubuisson was the son of the late Roberto D'Aubuisson, an infamous 1980s death squad leader during El Salvador's civil war who went on to found ARENA. 
Julio Rank, spokesman for El Salvador's President Tony Saca, said he doubted the killings were the work of highway robbers.
You can see with your own eyes the vicious way these people were burnt, he told reporters as rescuers pulled blackened body parts from the car ditched among bushes up a chilly mountain lane.
The fourth man found burned to death is thought to be the congressmen's driver.
A gang of white teenagers were jailed for almost 80 years on Tuesday for the racist murder of an Asian taxi driver beaten to death in Huddersfield last year.
Mohammad Parvaiz, a 41-year-old father of three, was killed last July after he responded to what he believed to be a routine request for a taxi. 
He suffered 23 separate injuries in the attack.
Christopher Murphy was given a minimum jail term of 25 years while the judge at Leeds Crown Court handed down a minimum 21-year sentence to Michael Hand.
Graeme Slavin and Steven Utley were jailed for a minimum of 17 years.
Police said the main motivation for the attack was revenge for an incident that had occurred a few weeks earlier when Murphy's scooter had been damaged after a confrontation with a group of Asian youths.
The gang mistakenly thought Parvaiz had been involved in this because he had been hired to drop off the Asian youths.
Detective Superintendent Tim Forber, who led the police investigation, said he agreed with the judge's assessment that the attacks were savage beyond belief.
This was a pre-meditated plan. 
It was a savage attack, it was about a specific intent for retribution, he told reporters.
I don't think I have ever come across anything so utterly mindless.
He also paid tribute to the dignity the victim's widow.
She is a very, very strong woman but her life has been absolutely devastated and I don't think she will get over it.
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki reiterated in Ankara on Tuesday that his country was in favour of solving the ongoing nuclear crisis through diplomacy and dialogue.
We have said that we want a diplomatic solution, Mottaki said at a press conference with his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul, adding that he hoped a meeting in Vienna between International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohamed ElBaradei and Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani would be constructive.
Let's hope that this time the negotiations will not be interrupted like in the past, Mottaki said, insisting that an international settlement of the issue needed to safeguard Iran's rights and erase all fears that Tehran aims to use its enrichment capabilities to build nuclear weapons.
The Larijani-ElBaradei meeting came on the eve of a United Nations deadline for Iran to stop enriching uranium, which is used to make nuclear reactor fuel but can also make atom bomb material.
The United States accuses Iran of seeking a nuclear weapon, a charge denied by Tehran, which insists its atomic effort is a peaceful energy programme.
ElBaradei is scheduled to file a report by Friday certifying whether Iran has honored a UN Security Council call last December 23 for it to stop the enrichment.
Mottaki and Gul also said Tuesday they had discussed Iraq, emphasising that if the situation there is not stabilised, neighbouring countries in the region will continue to be hit by terrorist attacks.
Mottaki, who spoke with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday, was scheduled to meet with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer in Istanbul on Wednesday.
Just because you're the daughter of Bill Gates does not mean you get to play on your computer all day long.
The Microsoft founder said his 10-year-old daughter, his oldest child, was not a hard-core Internet and computer user until this year, when she started at a school where the students use tablet computers for almost everything.
She became very avid and discovered a lot of computer games, including one that runs on the Xbox 360 called Viva Pinata, where you take care of your garden, he told a business audience in Ottawa.
She could spend two or three hours a day on this Viva Pinata, because it's kind of engaging and fun.
Gates said he and his wife Melinda decided to set a limit of 45 minutes a day of total screen time for games and an hour a day on weekends, plus what time she needs for homework.
Microsoft's new Vista software enables parents to control the Web sites their kids go to but also includes an audit log that records sites they have visited and whom they've been Instant Messaging.
Up to some age, to be determined, it's very appropriate for a parent to get a sense of what they're seeing out there and be able to have conversations about it, he said.
My son said, 'Am I going to have limits like this my whole life?', and I said, 'No, when you move away you can set your own screen limits', Gates recounted, to audience laughter.
Smoking causes long-lasting changes in the brain similar to changes seen in animals when they are given cocaine, heroin and other addictive drugs, U.S. researchers said on Tuesday.
A study of the brain tissue of smokers and nonsmokers who had died showed that smokers had the changes, even if they had quit years before, the team at the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported.
The data show that there are long-lasting chemical changes in the brains of humans, said Michael Kuhar of Emory University in Atlanta, who was not involved in the study.
The chemical changes alone suggest a physiological basis for nicotine addiction.
A team led by Bruce Hope of NIDA, one of the National Institutes of Health, analyzed levels of two enzymes found inside brain cells known as neurons.
These enzymes help the neurons use chemical signals such as those made by the message-carrying compound dopamine.
Smokers and former smokers had high levels of these enzymes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Neuroscience.
Hope said other studies had seen the same thing in animals given cocaine and heroin and it was clear that the drugs were causing the effects.
This strongly suggests that the similar changes observed in smokers and former smokers contributed to their addiction, he added in a statement.
Experts on smoking have long said that nicotine is at least as addictive as heroin.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 20.9 percent of all adults smoke in the United States, which adds up to 45 million people. 
And 23 percent of high school students smoke.
The European Union, United Nations, Russia and United States should end their immoral and counter-productive aid boycott of the Palestinian government, the international charity Oxfam said on Wednesday.
The comments come in the run-up to a meeting between US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and top diplomats from the other three members of the so-called Middle East Quartet on Wednesday in Berlin.
The Quartet needs to take off its blinkers and see the damage its policies are having on ordinary Palestinian families, Oxfam's international director Jeremy Hobbs said in a statement.
Using international aid as a battering ram to force through political change is not only immoral but also counter-productive.
The Quartet imposed the boycott a year ago after Hamas, blacklisted as a terrorist group by Washington, won legislative elections that gave them control of the government and refused to meet the group's conditions for recognition renounce violence, recognise Israel and comply with past Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.
Oxfam also called on Israel to release taxes it has withheld since Hamas was elected.
While the Palestinian Authority is bled dry by Israel's seizure of tax revenue and the international aid boycott, peace will be a distant dream.
The Berlin meeting comes soon after a rare encounter between Palestinian and Israeli leaders in a bid to revive their moribund peace negotiations.
U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney met Japan's top government spokesman Wednesday morning, the first of several meetings on the day with top Japanese officials including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reconfirm their nations' cooperation on the North Korean nuclear and abduction issues.
Cheney held a breakfast meeting with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki.
Shiozaki told Cheney of Japan's policy to provide no energy aid to North Korea unless the issue of Pyongyang's abductions of Japanese nationals is resolved.
Cheney replied that he understands the importance of the abduction issue, according to a Japanese government source.
During his three-day visit from Tuesday, Cheney is also expected to put Iraq and Afghanistan on the discussion agenda besides the North Korean issues, Japanese and U.S. officials said.
Cheney is scheduled to hold separate meetings Wednesday evening with Abe and Foreign Minister Taro Aso in Tokyo and have an audience with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko the same day.
Aso said ahead of Cheney's arrival Tuesday afternoon that the trip is aimed at building sound ties between Japan and the United States.
Japan is expected to seek U.S. cooperation regarding making progress on the issue of North Korea's decades-old abductions of Japanese nationals, Japanese officials said, referring to what they see as the major sticking point between Tokyo and Pyongyang.
Cheney is likely to reiterate that Washington will continue to help trying to settle the abduction issue, a senior U.S. administration official in Washington said earlier.
Raising the abductions in bilateral talks comes amid concern that Japan faces isolation over its North Korea policies due to its focus on first resolving the abduction issue. 
Tokyo has repeatedly said it will provide no aid to North Korea unless there is progress on the issue.
Six parties the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia agreed last week to exchange various forms of economic and humanitarian aid for steps by Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear arms and development programs.
Cheney last visited Japan in April 2004 and is holding his first meeting with Abe since he became Japanese prime minister last September.
Iraq is also likely to be on the agenda of Cheney's talks with Japanese officials as he is expected to explain Washington's new Iraq policy, and he plans to ask Japan to play a larger role in Iraq and Afghanistan to support the U.S.-led war on terrorism, the officials said.
Cheney's visit to Japan is part of a two-nation trip that will later take him to Australia, in what officials in Japan see as highlighting Washington's interest in forging stronger cooperation with its two close Asia-Pacific allies.
During his stay in Japan, Cheney will visit the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Wednesday.
So far, his itinerary includes no meeting with Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma, who about a month ago made comments critical of U.S. defense policy.
The Japanese officials said they are ''still talking about the possibility of a meeting'' in light of Cheney's tight schedule.
Aso said that the lack of a scheduled meeting between Cheney and Kyuma has nothing to do with Kyuma's recent controversial remarks, dismissing media speculation that Cheney is not meeting Kyuma due to U.S. displeasure over those comments.
Kyuma irked Washington by saying Jan. 24 that U.S. President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq was 'wrong.
Three days later, Kyuma said the United States lacks understanding regarding talks with Okinawa Prefecture over the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps Futemma Air Station within the prefecture.
A five-storey apartment block in an Istanbul suburb collapsed early on Wednesday, killing a woman, Turkish television and officials said.
Rescue teams with dogs dug survivors out of the rubble after the building in the Zeytinburnu district fell shortly after midnight. 
Istanbul's governor Muammer Guler said 26 people had been rescued and were being treated in hospital, among them a seriously injured child.
He said he did not expect more people to be found as records showed 27 people lived in the building. 
A block next door was evacuated.
Witnesses told Turkish television the building had been damaged in an earthquake in 1999 which killed around 18,000 people in northwest Turkey. 
Shoddy construction, lack of building regulation and corruption have been blamed for building collapses in Turkey in the past. 
The Treasury Department said Tuesday it has barred a Lebanon-based construction firm run by the Hezbollah militant group from access to the U.S. financial system.
The action bars the company, Jihad al-Bina, from making any transactions in the United States and freezes any assets it may have under U.S. jurisdiction.
The department said Jihad al-Bina receives direct funding from Iran and is overseen by Hezbollah's governing Shura Council. 
The U.S. government has designated Hezbollah a terrorist group.
It alleges that Jihad al-Bina has used deceptive means to seek funding for projects from international organizations and has bolstered Hezbollah's public standing by rebuilding war-ravaged areas in southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah operates Jihad al-Bina for its own construction needs as well as to attract popular support through the provision of civilian construction services, said Stuart Levey, under treasury secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. 
We will take action against all facets of this deadly terror group.
At the same time that we are targeting Hezbollah's construction company, the U.S. government is also working to ensure that legitimate reconstruction efforts, led by the Lebanese government, succeed, Levey said.
The United States pledged $230 million in humanitarian assistance to Lebanon in August 2006 and an additional $770 million in aid to it at last month's donors conference in Paris.
South Korea's foreign minister refused Wednesday to comment on whether North Korea has a secret uranium-based nuclear programme but said it must disable all weapons and programmes under last week's multinational deal.
It is not appropriate to publicly comment on which stage such a North Korean programme is at, minister Song Min-Soon said in response to a question on whether he believes Pyongyang has a uranium-based project.
On Tuesday Seoul's intelligence chief reportedly told a parliamentary committee he believes the North has a highly enriched uranium programme (HEU) despite its denials.
The United States also accuses the North of running such a project.
Song said six-nation negotiations had already produced a deal in 2005 on dismantling every nuclear programme which the communist state has.
All of the nuclear weapons and programmes that North Korea has and is presumed to have should be subject to dismantlement, he told a briefing.
It is an unchanged principle that all of its nuclear programmes, whether they are (based on) plutonium or uranium, should be dismantled.
A six-nation agreement reached last week has been criticised for not directly addressing North Korea's existing atomic bombs or its suspected HEU programme.
But Song stressed last week's deal was an initial step under which North Korea should start to make itself nuclear-free.
Under the February 13 deal the North, which conducted its first atomic bomb test last October, agreed to disable its nuclear facilities in exchange for badly-needed energy aid.
As a first step it will shut down and seal its Yongbyon plutonium-producing reactor within 60 days, admit UN nuclear inspectors and receive 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil or equivalent assistance in return.
Action to permanently disable the nuclear facilities would be rewarded with up to 950,000 tons of heavy oil or other aid.
Song said the 2005 abortive nuclear deal and last week's agreement obliges the North to eventually declare and remove all of its nuclear weaponry, facilities and programmes.
Israel and the Palestinians should open direct negotiations on the political future of Palestine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said ahead of a big power meeting on the Middle East on Wednesday.
We (Russia) will actively support direct contacts between (Palestinian President) Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert, Lavrov said in an interview with the government daily Rossiskaya Gazeta.
Contacts that would not deal solely with the opening of one checkpoint or another checkpoint, but aim to negotiate what the quartet has called the political horizon of Palestine.    
Foreign ministers from the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia will meet as a quartet in Berlin to work out differences over how to deal with the new Palestinian unity government.
Lavrov said it was important to avoid mutual reproaches and minor disputes over incursions and shootings.
These are petty provocations -- petty compared with the key task of forming a Palestinian state, Lavrov added. 
Lavrov also said Russia wanted the quartet to back the coalition deal between Abbas and militant group Hamas and lift economic sanctions.
The United States advocates a more cautious approach of continued sanctions and isolating Hamas.
Ugandan security forces have arrested two former rebels, including a rebel commander, in connection with a grenade blast that killed another ex-insurgent working for Uganda's army anti-terrorism unit.
A series of mortar, bomb and gun attacks across Iraq killed at least 36 people and wounded scores on Monday, security officials said.
Twelve people were killed and 28 wounded when several mortar shells slammed into a southern Baghdad district, a security official said.
The shells hit near a procession of pilgrims marking the annual Shiite mourning ceremony of Ashura which culminates on Tuesday, the official said, adding that none of the pilgrims was hurt.
The mortars were fired into Baghdad's mixed Zafaraniyah neighbourhood, he added.
A suicide car bomb attack on an Iraqi army checkpoint killed four people and wounded 17 in Baghdad's Kadhimiyah district, the official said, adding that soldiers were among the casualties.
In a separate incident, four people died and five were wounded when a bomb exploded inside a minibus on Palestine Street in eastern Baghdad, security and medical sources said.
Another car bomb in Baghdad's Shiite Sadr City district killed one and wounded three more, while in the capital's central Karrada district a sniper shot dead a policeman standing guard at a bank, the security source said.
In the restive Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad, nine people were killed in a wave of attacks.
Of these, seven were shot dead in the provincial capital of Baquba, and a woman was killed in a mortar attack in the town of Khallis near Baquba, police said.
Attacks were also reported in the country's northern and southern regions.
In the northern oil city of Kirkuk, one person was killed by a bomb placed outside the entrance to a cemetery, police said, adding that the entrance was specifically assigned for taking in the bodies of Arabs and Turkmen.
In the southern city of Amara, two people were killed when a roadside bomb blew up as an Iraqi army patrol passed, police said.
Elsewhere two people were reported killed.
Police also recovered 25 bodies  22 in Baghdad alone  of people killed in apparent sectarian attacks.
Three bodies were retrieved from the Tigris river near the town of Suwaira, south of Baghdad, including one that had been decapitated, a security source said.
The unabated bloodshed comes as some 50,000 Iraqi soldiers and policemen along with 35,000 US troops are about to be deployed in Baghdad in a bid to quell the raging sectarian and insurgent violence which the United Nations said killed 16,800 people last year in the city.
The deployment is part of a make-or-break plan by US President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to retake control of the capital's streets.
The Palestinian ruling party Hamas and its rivals Fatah late Monday called a joint ceasefire after four days of vicious factional fighting left 33 people dead, the territories' foreign minister said.
Minister Mahmud Zahar's announcement came after gun battles between rival Hamas and Fatah factions raged across Gaza despite a Saudi offer to mediate an end to the worst internecine violence in a year.
A ceasefire will come into force at 3:00 am, Zahar told journalists, reading a joint statement after Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniya met with Rawhi Fattuh, a representative of Palestinian Fatah president Mahmud Abbas.
All clashes must stop and armed men must withdraw immediately from the streets.
The ceasefire statement also called for militants loyal to both parties to release hostages they have taken from each side over recent days. 
Az-Zahar added that Haniya and Abbas would meet soon to relaunch a dialogue.
The call came after the worst violence since Hamas won a landslide election a year ago. 
The unrest torpedoed on-and-off talks to broker a power-sharing agreement and sparked Arab diplomatic efforts to appease the disturbances.
Two officers in the mainstream and pro-Fatah security apparatus, a Hamas activists and a civilian died on Monday, the latest casualties in four days of bitter fighting in which around 100 people have also been wounded, medics said.
On Monday night, a rocket-propelled grenade slammed into the Palestinian national security and police headquarters in Gaza City causing widespread damage, witnesses and security sources said.
Abbas, meanwhile, arrived late Monday in Cairo where he was to hold talks Tuesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip, an airport source in the Egyptian capital said.
Egyptian security representatives also attended the meeting in Gaza between Haniya and Fattuh.
Abbas, speaking publicly on the latest bout of fighting for the first time, earlier Monday described the troubles as tragic and insisted that he would not allow the territories to disintegrate into civil war.
Tensions were aggravated last month when Abbas announced a plan for early elections, angering Hamas which denounced it as a bid to seize power. 
Talks on a national unity government resumed on January 23 but were interrupted by violence.
The warring factions have set up roadblocks and traded gun, anti-rocket and mortar fire throughout Gaza. 
Streets have become deserted as shopkeepers board up shops and civilians retreat to the relative safety of their homes.
The Hamas-controlled interior ministry said its director, Ibrahim Salah, escaped an assassination attempt in which one of his bodyguards was wounded.
The ministry blamed Mohammed Dahlan, Fatah's chief strongman in Gaza.
In a telephone conversation with Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, Haniya promised that his Hamas-led government would make maximum effort to defuse the explosive situation, the cabinet said.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose country recently hosted talks between Abbas and Hamas supremo Khaled Meshaal, telephoned Mubarak to discuss ways to end the fighting, said the SANA news agency.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah offered to hold talks in the Muslim holy city of Mecca to stop what he called the disgraceful fighting, a proposal welcomed by Palestinian leaders on both sides.
Meshaal, who is based in Syria, and Fatah party leader Abbas welcomed the offer, although no date for talks has yet been announced and previous efforts to end the feuding have collapsed as killings have continued.
The groups blame each other for provoking the violence, which has exacerbated the woes of Palestinians gripped by the worst economic crisis in their recent history following a Western aid freeze after Hamas took office.
Hamas's rise to power has pitted its loyalists against the once dominant Fatah, which still occupies the presidency in a divided Palestinian government.
Palestinians are struggling to survive under the Western-led boycott against defiant Hamas, which refuses international demands to recognise Israel, renounce violence and abide by past peace deals.
China will expand anti-corruption audits of senior military officers as People's Liberation Army commanders seek to ensure the country's expanding military budget is spent as intended, state media reported.
At least 30 percent of officers at army, division and regiment levels would be audited in 2007 for possible financial misdeeds, the official Xinhua news agency reported late on Monday.
The head of the PLA's logistics department, Liao Xilong, told a meeting of officers that the crackdown was meant to ensure that China's military budget is not squandered. 
Wayward officers would be harshly punished, he warned.
We must comprehensively monitor funding meant to prepare for military struggle  its direction and amount, implementation of plans, and the results, Liao said, according to Xinhua. 
Ensure that all aspects of battle preparedness development pass the tests of war and history.
Over the past year, President Hu Jintao has pursued a drive against corruption, purging errant and disloyal officials. 
His campaign has reached into the country's military, which has enjoyed rapidly rising budgets over the past decade, as Beijing seeks to secure its regional influence and deter Taiwan, the self-ruled island, from moving towards full independence.
In January, the PLA introduced new rules to regularise audits of officers; about 1,000 senior officers already had their accounts inspected in 2006, according to reports last year. 
Last month, Hong Kong media reported that a Chinese vice-admiral was given a life sentence for embezzlement. 
He was accused of accepting bribes from contractors in exchange for building projects.
In recent years, the PLA - the world's largest force measured by personnel - has sought to raise efficiency by opening some procurement spending to commercial tenders. 
No official Chinese military budget figure is available for 2007, and many foreign experts say the PLA's actual spending is much higher than it reports.
The Nepalese government has decided to remove King Gyanendra's portrait from new bank notes, news reports said Friday.
At a cabinet meeting it was decided to replace the existing portrait of the king with a picture of the world's tallest peak, Mount Everest, on the new 10 rupee bank notes, the Nepali-language daily Kantipur reported.
The new bank notes will be brought into circulation soon, the newspaper said.
This will be the first time in Nepalese history that a king will not feature on the Nepalese currency notes and marks a significant step to move away from the institution of monarchy.
King Gyanendra, who was toppled during a mass movement of the Seven Party Alliance and the Maoists in April 2006, has been stripped of virtually all powers and royal symbols have been removed from government offices, including the Nepalese parliament.
The constituent assembly, formed after an election in mid-June, will vote to decide whether Nepal remains a monarchy or not.
According to the newspaper, Nepal's central bank had sent several samples of the new bank notes including the one with Lord Buddha for approval.
However, there have been objections from followers of the Buddhist faith over the depiction of Lord Buddha on the bank notes and the cabinet took no decision on other denominations of bank note.
The Nepalese government is likely to make a final decision on the replacement pictures on 1,000 and 500 rupee bank notes very soon and will ultimately bring them into circulation.
The Nepalese government has already decided to remove all references to the monarch from bank notes and coins.
British police said on Friday they had arrested a 48-year-old man who claimed to have sent one of a series of letter bombs to hit the country in recent weeks.
Anton Setchell, the police national coordinator for domestic extremism, said the man had been detained on Thursday under the Mental Health Act after he called a radio station to claim responsibility for a letter bomb in Wokingham, southern England, on Tuesday.
Despite this significant development there remains in place a substantial police investigation spread across several force areas. 
The focus of my investigation remains broad, Setchell told a news conference.
Six people were hurt in Swansea, south Wales, on Wednesday by the seventh letter bomb in a three-week campaign that has included at least three targets related to the enforcement of traffic rules. 
Police have said they believe the bombs were intended to shock, not kill.
Three of the letter bombs were sent in January, one of which bore the name of a jailed animal rights activist.
I continue to investigate leads that point towards animal rights extremism but equally I am focused in several other areas, Setchell said.
Sri Lanka's president Friday sacked three ministers, including the former foreign minister, amid growing dissension within the newly-elected 54-member cabinet, officials said.
President Mahinda Rajapakse dismissed former foreign minster Mangala Samaraweera, who is now Ports Minister, National Heritage Minister Anura Bandaranaike and non-cabinet Ports Minister Sripathi Sooriarachchi.
The president signed the letters dismissing the three ministers with immediate effect, a spokesman for the president's office said, adding that no replacements had yet been named.
The surprise sacking came a day after Bandaranaike, the brother of former president Chandrika Kumaratunga, publicly declared that elements of the government were trying to intimidate him with death threats.
The three men had also opposed Rajapakse's move to accommodate 18 opposition legislators within government ranks late last month and reward 10 of them with plum cabinet positions.
All three were demoted from the positions they held when the defectors were introduced. 
The cabinet swelled to 54 members, setting a record for the biggest government since independence from Britain in 1948.
The former foreign minister was a key ally of Rajapakse during the 2005 November presidential election campaign but fell out of favour over ideological differences.
Rajapakse went against Samaraweera's advice and accepted defectors from the opposition in a bid to secure a majority in the 225-member parliament where he had inherited a minority government elected separately in 2004.
The president has moved to nip a rebellion in the bud, a diplomatic source said. 
This is a signal to others that the president means business and won't hesitate to sack anyone.
With last month's defections, Rajapakse's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) enjoys a majority and the sacking of the three ministers will not immediately cause any problems for the government's stability in parliament.
Ten Taliban were killed in clashes with Afghan and British troops near a major dam project in southern Afghanistan, police said Friday.
NATO's International Security Assistance Force, under which the British troops serve, confirmed the fighting in the Kajaki and Sangin areas of southern Helmand province on Thursday but not the death toll.
The districts border Musa Qala, where Taliban fighters took control of the main town a week ago.
There were no ISAF casualties, spokesman Captain Andre Salloum said.
We know that 10 Taliban, including one of their commanders, were killed, said Helmand province police chief Nabi Jan Mullahkhail.
Some of the Taliban involved in the fighting around Kajaki had come from Musa Qala, he said.
A tribal elder said there had been around 300 Taliban in Musa Qala town, captured overnight last Friday. 
The government has said it wants to persuade the Taliban to leave through negotiations.
British troops have been trying for weeks to clear the Kajaki area so that work can resume to rehabilitate a hydro-power dam that has the potential to provide electricity to 1.8 million people.
Helmand has seen some of the worst Taliban-linked unrest in Afghanistan and also produces about a quarter of the country's illegal opium crop, the largest in the world.
Opium production increased by 179 percent there last year, UN experts say, linking the drugs trade to the insurgency.
Most of a British deployment of 5,200 troops to Afghanistan is in Helmand.
Nigerian security agencies have been investigating subversive activities by some foreign correspondents, Information Minister Frank Nweke said on Friday.
In a statement mainly devoted to attacking a report on Nigeria by U.S. television station CNN, Nweke denounced what he called the stereotypical apocalyptic picture some Western media construct of Nigeria and Africa.
The report on kidnapping in the Niger Delta, he said, is another evidence of the subversive activities of some foreign correspondents in Nigeria which the Nigerian security agencies have been investigating.
A CNN spokesman in Atlanta said: We stand by the story and we refute the allegations.
Some Nigerian journalists have been arrested in past months over political stories, drawing international criticism, but there have been no recent examples of foreign reporters facing serious problems with the authorities.
Two Nigerian journalists were charged with sedition last year for saying the president's new jet was second-hand.
Nigeria is preparing for elections in April that should mark the first democratic transition from one civilian government to another.
Nweke is the architect of a campaign called Heart of Africa that seeks to improve Nigeria's image. 
The government has bought advertising space on London buses and in underground train stations to display billboards showing glamorous, successful Nigerians.
The campaign aims to debunk Nigeria's image abroad as a country blighted by corruption, crime, poverty and inter-communal violence. 
One of the slogans is Nigeria. 
It's not what you think.
But such efforts have had to contend with a constant flow of bad news, especially from the Niger Delta, the impoverished wetlands region that accounts for all of Nigeria's oil production.
Kidnappings are an almost daily occurrence there. 
Different armed groups are holding 31 foreigners hostage, thousands of expatriate workers have fled and a fifth of oil production is shut down because of militant attacks.
Other Nigerian stories that made international headlines in recent months include a pipeline fire that killed almost 300 people in Lagos, the third major plane crash in 12 months and the first confirmed death from bird flu in sub-Saharan Africa.
Unknown assailants on Friday fired a rocket into a hotel in north Mogadishu where senior government officials were staying in the latest post-war violence in the chaotic Somali capital, security officials said.
It struck the reception, breaking windows there. 
Definitely, there must be people who are wounded, one official told Reuters by telephone of the strike on the Global Hotel.
Since Islamists were ousted over the New Year during an offensive by Somali government and Ethiopian forces, there have been near-daily mortar, rocket and gun attacks in the city.
Civilians have mainly been the victims.
Among officials in the hotel hit on Friday was the deputy speaker of Somalia's parliament, authorities said.
Lebanon's Defence Minister Elias Murr said Friday that weapons seized from the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah will be given to the Lebanese army to confront Israel in case of any future violations of Lebanese territory.
The trucks and the confiscated weapons are now with the Lebanese army in southern Lebanon, Murr told reporters in reference to a truck confiscated east of Beirut on Thursday carrying Hezbollah arms which included Grad rockets.
If Israel carried out another violation, we will use these weapons against it, Murr told reporters after a meeting with the commander of the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Major General Claudio Graziano.
Murr told Graziano that Lebanese troops deployed in southern Lebanon have orders to confront Israeli forces in case of any new violation of Lebanon's sovereignty.
On Wednesday night, Lebanese and Israeli troops clashed across the border in the first such incident in decades. 
The confrontation caused no casualties.
The exchange of fire was the first armed incident at the Israeli-Lebanese border since Israeli troops withdrew from Lebanon in October, after fighting a devastating 33-day war against Hezbollah.
Hezbollah senior politburo member Sheikh Mohammed Yazbeck called on the Lebanese authorities to return the truck. 
We are still in a confrontation with the enemy which continues to occupy parts of our land and continues to hold Lebanese detainees.
US photographer Spencer Platt has won the World Press Photo 2006 award for his picture of a group of young Lebanese in war-devastated south Beirut, the organizers accounced in Amsterdam Friday.
Platt's photograph shows a group of young people driving around on August 15 in a part of the city that had been severely hit by Israeli bombs.
The photograph was taken immediately after a ceasefire went into effect between Israel and the Shiite Hezbollah movement.
Michele McNally, chairman of the jury said: It's a picture you can keep looking at. 
It has the complexity and contradiction of real life, amidst chaos.
This photograph makes you look beyond the obvious.
Platt is to receive his prize of 10,000 euros (13,000 dollars) on April 22 in Amsterdam's Old Church, where the winning photographs will be exhibited from April 24 to June 17.
The jury looked at jury 78,083 photographs taken by 4,460 photographers from 124 countries. 
Some of the pictures are to be seen on the website.
The US Air Force's planned deployment of its newest stealth fighters at its base in Okinawa was postponed on Saturday, a United States Forces Japan spokesman said.
Twelve F-22A Raptors had been scheduled to fly in to Kadena Air Base on the northern coast of the Japanese island Saturday afternoon from a base in Hawaii.
But the deployment will be delayed at least until Sunday afternoon, the spokesman said without clarifying the reason for the delay.
This will be the first overseas deployment for the US Air Force's new fighter developed by defence contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. as a successor to the F-15 fighter.
Taliban ambushed a police patrol in Afghanistan's southern province of Kandahar overnight Saturday, killing four police and wounding three more, a police chief said.
The police were on patrol late Friday in the insurgency-hit Panjwayi district when Taliban fighters opened fire, kicking off a gunbattle, provincial police chief General Asmatullah Alizay told AFP.
Four police were martyred and another three were wounded, Alizay said. 
He did not say if there were casualties on the Taliban side.
A purported Taliban spokesman, Yousuf Ahmadi, claimed responsibility for the ambush in a telephone call from undisclosed location. 
Ahmadi claimed around 10 police were killed and wounded.
Police are regular targets of Taliban attacks in an insurgency launched after the hardliners were removed from government in late 2001.
Southern Afghanistan sees most of the violence. 
Police reported Friday that 10 Taliban were killed the previous day in clashes with Afghan and British troops near a major dam project in Helmand province.
The small town of Musa Qala, also in Helmand, has meanwhile been in Taliban hands for more than a week with the government able to call on NATO military support to oust the rebels but saying it wants a peaceful solution.
Afghanistan saw a dramatic increase in the level of Taliban-led militancy in 2006 with more than 4,000 people killed, most of them rebels. 
The religious extremists were toppled from power in a US-led offensive.
Chinese President Hu Jintao heads home Saturday after completing a 12-day, eight-nation tour of Africa where he spread Beijing's largesse and rejected criticism that China is milking the world's poorest region through unequal trade.
The visit to the Seychelles, which began Friday, was the last stop in Hu's trip, his third visit to Africa since taking office in 2003.
A primary goal of Hu's trip was to continue building economic and political ties with resource-rich Africa, increasingly important for fuelling China's growth.
Before Hu began the tour in Cameroon on January 30 China announced it would write off debts owed by 33 African countries as part of a multi-billion-dollar pledge made last year to help fast-track the continent's development.
On each stop in Africa Hu announced loans and grants, as well as signing deals to boost trade, which reached 55.5 billion dollars last year, according to official Chinese figures.
Hu consistently stressed throughout his tour that Africa had as much to benefit as China from the burgeoning relationship which has seen trade between Beijing and the continent triple in the last five years.
During a keynote speech in South Africa, which is China's largest trading partner in Africa, Hu said his country would certainly not do anything harmful to the interests of Africa and its people.
He said almost a century of foreign exploitation in China by Western powers had permanently scarred Beijing and therefore it was against any form of colonialism or slavery.
China and Africa have extensive common ground and a fine tradition of cooperation on major international issues. It serves our shared interest to strengthen coordination in international affairs, he said.
China's courting of Africa has caused tremors in the West in recent years as Chinese influence there has risen significantly.
While Western businesses have seen Chinese firms secure contracts to exploit Africa's natural resources, human rights groups and some governments have accused China of co-operating with regimes accused of human rights abuses.
The European Investment Bank, the European Union's financing arm, warned on Thursday that aggressive Chinese lending in Africa could drive up debt levels dangerously.
For some African countries, if funding comes too easily they are at risk of running up excessive debts, said the bank's president, Philippe Maystadt. 
He called on Chinese banks to apply tougher lending conditions based on the economic viability of projects and good governance, and impose environmental and social requirements.
The growing influence of Beijing has also sparked resentment among workers in several countries, particularly in Zambia, where Chinese firms in the mining, textile and construction industries have been accused of paying low wages, lax safety standards and bringing in foreign workers.
During his visit to the southern African country Hu announced that China will invest 800 million dollars (617 million euros) in the development of copper mines in the special economic zone of Chambishi in the north.
But his visit to a Chinese-run copper mine in Chambishi, where 50 Zambians died in a mine explosion in 2005, had to be cancelled after reports of planned protests.
Hopes China could turn the tide of months of failed diplomacy in Darfur were dashed when only mild pressure at most was applied on Khartoum during Hu's meetings with Sudanese leaders.
As Sudan's major trading and investment partner, China was seen as having enough leverage to convince Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir to accept UN peacekeepers for Darfur, where at least 200,000 people have died and more than two million have fled their homes.
After visiting Cameroon Hu went on to visit Liberia, Sudan, Zambia, Namibia, South Africa, and Mozambique before heading to the Indian Ocean Seychelles Islands.
Top advisers to Mahmud Abbas said they had fruitful talks with UN chief Ban Ki-moon here Friday on the Palestinian president's power-sharing agreement with the radical Islamist movement Hamas in Mecca.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and top Palestine Liberation Organization member Yasser Abed Rabbo also brought up the next meeting of the Middle East Peace Quartet the United States, the European Union, the UN and Russia in Berlin on February 21.
We had a fruitful meeting with the secretary general, Rabbo told reporters, noting that the focus was on Abbas's accord with Hamas supremo Khaled Meshaal in Saudi Arabia Thursday to form a unity government in a bid to end deadly factional fighting and win back Western aid.
The meeting also dealt with issues related to the next meeting of the Quartet, Rabbo added.
The two Palestinian negotiators came to UN headquarters only hours after they met with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Washington on their way back from Mecca.
Palestinian observer to the UN Ryad Mansour told reporters that Erekat indicated that Rice's initial reaction to the Mecca agreement was cautious and that the US chief diplomat was enthusiastic about her three-way summit with Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on February 19.
Asked about a statement issued by the Quartet Friday urging the next Palestinian national unity government to recognize Israel, Mansour said: One should take into consideration that shifting political positions does not happen overnight.
One should be patient to give time to allow this transformation to take place, the Palestinian observer noted, adding that Erekat felt that the shifts were heading in a positive direction one should support.
The Mecca accord made no explicit reference to Israel or to respecting interim peace deals signed by the PLO.
But in a letter formally tasking Haniya with forming the new cabinet, Abbas called on him to respect agreements signed by the PLO, which Hamas has never joined.
Meshaal said the Islamist movement will stick to Abbas's commissioning letter, but did not clarify his group's position on recogizing Israel. 
Embattled Guinea President Lansana Conte appointed Friday a new prime minister, fulfilling a promise made after an 18-day general strike in which 59 people died, just hours after fresh violence wracked the country.
But the opposition quickly rejected the appointment of Eugene Camara, 64, a longtime government minister, as being too close to president.
With the Sunday midnight deadline set by the West African country's powerful unions fast approaching for the president to appoint a prime minister or face more unrest, thousands of protesters went on the rampage Friday in the north and the west of the country calling for the ailing Conte to step down.
The strikers set up barricades on the streets, overpowered police, torched two police stations and freed prisoners in Duinguiraye, 400 kilometres northeast of Conakry.
Eleven people were injured in the unrest.
Hours later, Conte who is in poor health and is rarely seen in public, announced the appointment of Presidential Affairs Minister Eugene Camara, 64, to the post of prime minister, through a decree read on state television.
Camara, is a senior civil servant who quietly rose through the ranks of the Guinean administration, and is seen as a moderate who is close to Conte.
The post of prime minister has been vacant since Conte sacked Cellou Diallo last April.
The new prime minister will have more power than his predecessors and will head the government a role undertaken by the president since independence from France in 1958.
After arduous negotiations between the union leaders and emissaries of the president last month, the ailing 72-year-old Conte agreed to give up his role as head of government.
At face value, Camara appears to meet the criteria set by unions last month who demanded a high-ranking competent civilian, with integrity untainted by graft in a country rated the most corrupt by the global watchdog Transparency International.
But observers in Conakry believe that his closeness to Conte, as well as his apparent weak personality, might give rise to reservations among the ranks of the unions, civil society and the opposition.
The opposition, quickly cried foul and slammed the appointment.
Camara is known for his faithfulness and allegiance towards Conte, said Mamadou Ba, spokesman of a grouping of 14 opposition parties said.
The president has shown that he is not ready.
But he does not want to appoint somebody who is a leader, Ba told AFP.
Three prime ministers have served under Conte over the past two decades and all either been sacked or quit. 
I accept this news with much emotion. 
It is an immense task which awaits me, but by the blessings of all, I will do my best, Camara, who has a tough task of lifting the bauxite rich country out of its social and economic woes, told AFP.
He entered government in 1997 as minister higher education and scientific research.
Camarra occupied that post until 2004 when he was appointed minister of planning, and was moved to the ministry of presidential affairs last month in a government reshuffle during the strike.
During the January strike Conte unleashed his security forces and in the ensuing heavy-handed crackdown, 59 people lost their lives including 49 on January 22 alone.
A new U.S. general took command of the American military in Iraq on Saturday, just days after an offensive began in Baghdad that aims to halt the country's slide into civil war.
General David Petraeus, a veteran of two Iraq tours and a counter-insurgency expert, took over from General George Casey during a ceremony at a U.S. base near Baghdad's airport.
Petraeus has urged that 21,500 extra American troops being sent to Iraq for the campaign be deployed as quickly as possible. 
Casey had been sceptical of troop increases.
A fire at a two-storey house in southern China wiped out almost an entire family, killing five children and their mother, the Nanfang Daily reported on Saturday.
The fire broke out at the village house in the southern city of Shantou early on Friday, said the newspaper. 
The children killed by the fire were aged between 8 and 16, the report said.
Their mother died after rushing back into the house in an attempt to rescue her children, while her husband survived by jumping from the second floor, breaking his legs, it said.
The cause of the fire was being investigated. 
Suspected militants used explosives to blow a large hole in one of Pakistan's biggest gas pipelines on Saturday, cutting off supplies to the main southwestern city of Quetta, police said.
A Baluchistan government official blamed tribal militants who are fighting for a greater share of the province's rich mineral wealth.
The blast blew up a three feet-long piece of the main pipeline, police officer Tariq Munzoor said, adding repair work had started at Kashmirabad just south of Quetta.
Insurgents linked to certain ethnic Baluch chieftains have waged a two-year campaign to win more political rights and a greater share of profits from the region's vast natural resources.
They also oppose President Pervez Musharraf's plan to build several military cantonments in the province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.
At least eight people were killed in New Delhi on Sunday when a building collapsed in the bustling Madipur commercial district, the fire department said.
An equal number of others were injured and taken to hospital after the multi-storied complex went down, fire department spokesman Anup Sharma told AFP.
It's too early to say if the collapsed building was a housing complex or a commercial building, the official added.
The collapse occurred two days after the local administration unveiled a blueprint for fresh construction in the city of 14 million people until 2020, giving its approval to newer high-density housing.
A Saudi airliner with about 300 people on board burst its four tyres Sunday as it was preparing to take off for Jeddah, airport officials and witnesses said.
The accident on the runway forced an emergency closure of the international airport in the capital Dhaka to all incoming aircraft.
An Indian Airlines flight was returned to Kolkata while several other flights were diverted to Chittagong city, 250 kilometres south of Dhaka.
Saudia airlines and Bangladeshi engineers were working on the aircraft.
Initial reports said no one were injured in the mishap. 
An official probe into the incident was ordered.
No deal was reached Sunday during a tense day of six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme, and discussions will continue into the working week, the chief Japanese envoy said.
I think the situation still remains tough. 
Tomorrow it will become clearer which way it is going, whether the discussions are heading towards a settlement or not, Kenichiro Sasae told reporters.
The latest round of talks which began in 2003 and involve host China, the two Koreas, the United States, Japan and Russia began on Thursday on a positive note, with China circulating a draft accord on a potential deal.
The plan calls for Pyongyang to begin taking steps towards ending its nuclear programme in return for economic incentives, but has snagged on what Sasae said earlier Sunday were North Korea's excessive demands for energy aid.
Sasae said following the end of Sunday's talks that the day's events had been held in a more tense atmosphere than the previous day, and that energy remained one of the biggest sticking points.
It is indeed one of the biggest issues, he said, when asked about the debate over energy.
North Korea, apparently emboldened by its October detonation of a nuclear device, has demanded two million tonnes of fuel oil and other inducements, Japanese press have reported.
That would be four times as much fuel oil as offered under a now-defunct 1994 disarmament deal.
New Zealand police were trying to establish Sunday why a tourist bus crashed, injuring three Korean tourists so badly that they had to have their arms amputated.
The victims were two women aged 19 and another aged 34. 
Three others, including two 13-year-old girls, were in hospital following Saturday's crash, a few hours after a party of Korean visitors arrived in Auckland to begin a New Zealand tour.
Radio New Zealand said 15 of the 25 people on the tour bus were initially taken to hospital after the bus left the road on the way to the lakeside tourist resort Taupo.
Road Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven told media he wanted to make seat belts compulsory in all new tour buses. 
Rescue workers found the bodies of six people who suffocated deep in an underground cavern on Spain's Canary Islands on Sunday, a spokeswoman said.
The six were part of a group of 30, including scientists and members of a nature organisation, who had been exploring caves on Tenerife on Saturday. 
Most had managed to get out unaided, but eight were rescued in the early hours of the morning with acute breathing difficulties and were taken to a hospital.
Rescuers found the last six in the afternoon. 
There were five men and one woman, and one of the men was Italian. 
I can confirm there are six dead, and we have recovered five of the bodies so far, a spokeswoman for the emergency services said.
She said the missing were 1,500 to 2,000 metres (5,000 to 6,500 feet) underground and access for rescue workers was very difficult.
The official cause of death would not be confirmed until there was an autopsy, but initially it looked like lack of oxygen rather than toxic gas, she said.
The tunnels are very narrow. 
There is not much air and this was a big group, she earlier said.
The underground labyrinths on the volcanic island of Tenerife, off the coast of Morocco, are known to some locals. 
Newspaper El Pais said some were tunnels excavated in the 19th century in the search for water and that they were often filled with volcanic gases.
The Teide mountain on Tenerife is one of Europe's few active volcanoes.
French rescue teams Sunday recovered the remains of three persons killed when their small twin-engine Piper plane crashed the day before.
Officials said a couple and their child were found dead in the wreckage from the British-registered plane which had crashed in the in the Vercors mountain range of the French Alps.
The plane had left Shoreham, in England, and was on its way to the Mediterranean seaside city of Cannes when it disappeared from the radar screens. 
Officials believed the pilot was US citizen living in England.
The United States will not bargain any more with North Korea on its nuclear weapons programme, the US envoy to six-nation disarmament talks said here Monday on the final day of discussions.
I think we have put everything on the table. 
We offered a way forward on a number of issues. They just have to make a decision. 
I don't think we are going to do any more bargaining, Christopher Hill told reporters.
Hill said Monday would be the final day of talks, which started Thursday on an optimistic note with host China presenting a proposal for North Korea to take initial steps towards disarmament in return for economic incentives.
Hill hinted that the six-party talks which began in 2003 and group China with the two Koreas, the United States, Japan and Russia could be nearing the end of their usefulness if an agreement was not reached in this round.
I think there is a certain life cycle to these negotiations and I think there is an opportunity here, he said.
I think a lot of people have to look and consider the value of this diplomatic track.
I don't want to predict this is the last chance but I think it is a moment that we have to see whether the DPRK (North Korea) is interested in this opportunity or not.
Chief Japanese envoy Kenichiro Sasae told reporters Sunday that the problem in the current round of talks was North Korea's excessive expectations for energy aid in exchange for beginning to dismantle its nuclear facilities.
North Korea, apparently emboldened by its first-ever nuclear test in October last year, has demanded two million tonnes of fuel oil and other inducements, Japanese Press have reported.
Seven people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed when a multi-storeyed residential building located at a densely populated slum cluster in west Delhi collapsed during rains Sunday.
Fire fighters pulled out seven dead bodies, including that of a child and the owner of the building. 
Rescued six injured people who were admitted to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital and Balaji Health Care Institute, a senior Delhi police official said.
Earlier, the same official had put the toll at eight.
The condition of three of the injured was stated to be critical.
Fire brigade and police personnel scoured through the rubble for nearly six hours before calling off the operation during which they faced difficulties due to poor light, intermittent rains and hostile crowd which resented the late arrival of ambulances.
Police suspect that the structure was weak because of the use of low-quality construction material. 
The Municipal Corporation of Delhi had earlier last year issued a notice to the owner of the building for removing certain portions constructed illegally.
Three people on board a tuna fishing boat are missing after the vessel was found sunk in the sea off Miyazaki Prefecture Sunday morning, the Kagoshima Coast Guard Office of the Japan Coast Guard said.
Another fishing boat found the Yukiyoshi Maru with only its stern appearing above the surface of the water at around 6:40 a.m. about 130 kilometers southeast off the coast of the city of Kushima in the southwestern Japan prefecture, it said.
The Kagoshima Coast Guard Office is searching for the three and contacting other vessels in the area, suspecting any of the vessels might have been involved in a collision with the Yukiyoshi Maru, Coast Guard officials said.
The three on board were Yukihiro Koresawa, 48, the captain, Michio Yamanaka, 56, a deckhand, both from the city of Hyuga, and Yohei Hayashi, 29, a television cameraman from Fukuoka Prefecture.
The Coast Guard officials said a raft on the tuna fishing boat is missing.
The Yukiyoshi Maru left port in Hyuga early Thursday and was last seen Friday morning.
Two French Muslim organizations filed a lawsuit against a magazine that recently republished Danish cartoons insulting Prophet Muhammad.
The Grand Mosque of Paris and the Union of French Islamic Organizations accuse the magazine Charlie Hebdo of 'insulting people on the basis of religion', and inciting racial hatred by reprinting the offensive caricatures that were published by Danish newspapers last year.
The French newspaper Liberation, which called the trial 'idiotic', also republished the cartoons in solidarity with the magazine. 
The Paris court heard the case and will issue its ruling at a later date.
The two Muslim groups said Charlie Hebdo's decision to reprint the blasphemous caricatures was 'part of a considered plan of provocation aimed against the Islamic community in its most intimate faith. 
But Charlie Hebdo and Liberation claim that Muslim groups have no right to limit what they call 'freedom of speech'.
However, an opinion poll published on the Catholic weekly Pelerin suggested that 79% believed it was unacceptable to ridicule a religion publicly. 
A television debate between Charlie Hebdo publisher Philippe Val and Paris Grand Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur also showed deep differences between the two sides, particularly over the limits of free speech, Islamonline.net reported.
Boubakeur said the offensive cartoons showing Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) with a bomb in his turban was not simply satire, but an insult against all Muslims by suggesting they were all terrorists.
We don't want censorship, we don't want the sacred to be protected by blasphemy laws or medieval jurisdiction, he said.
Last week, Boubakeur said he wanted to show the republishing the blasphemous cartoons was a provocation equal to acts of anti-Semitism or Holocaust denial, which are both banned under French law.
The offensive caricatures originally appeared in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten on September 30, 2005. 
It was later reprinted in several European newspapers, angering Muslims all over the world. 
Last October, a Danish court rejected a libel case brought by several Muslim organizations against the Jyllands-Posten. Ironically, the court said there was no reason to believe the cartoons were meant to be 'insulting' or 'harmful'.
Sri Lanka's Navy destroyed a suspected Tamil Tiger boat and damaged another at sea off the island's northeast coast before dawn on Monday, officials said, estimating around 10 rebels were killed.
Navy fast-attack boats and ground troops destroyed and sank one of the small boats around 40 km north of the strategic northeastern harbour of Trincomalee. 
Sailors found what they believe to be the remains of a slain suicide bomber in the damaged boat.
The Navy detected two boats at around 4:30 in the morning and we have engaged in the sea and from land, said Navy Spokesman Commander D.K.P Dassanayake. 
We have destroyed one boat and recovered another fitted with weapons.
It was not clear how many people were aboard the boats, but Dassanayake said he suspected around 10 Tamil Tigers were killed and the Navy was scouring the sea for bodies. 
The Tigers were not immediately available for comment.
It was the latest naval confrontation amid a new chapter in two decades of civil war. 
The incident comes a fortnight after the navy sank three suspected Tiger craft off the main harbour in the capital, Colombo.
But analysts say the government and military are underestimating the rebels, expect the Tigers to hit back and forecast the conflict will escalate.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Sunday that Palestinians would shortly have a coalition government capable of forging good ties with the world's governments.
I believe the new government will be capable of performing its duties and will pursue a political programme that qualifies it to establish good ties with the world, Abbas said after talks with Jordanian Prime Minister Marouf Bakhit in Amman.
Abbas said that discussions focused on the agreement reached Thursday in Mecca, with Saudi brokerage between Abbas' Fatah faction and the ruling Hamas movement.
The accord provides for the formation of a national unity government that puts an end to a year-long power struggle that recently descended into bloody fighting in the Gaza Strip.
Responding to a question, Abbas said that on his return to Ramallah, he planned to ask Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, who leads the Hamas-dominated cabinet, to tender his government's resignation as a prelude for asking him to form a new cabinet.
Asked about Israeli reaction to the Mecca accord, Abbas said: So far we don't know their response, but regardless of their reaction this is a Palestinian and an Arab issue, and the Israelis should deal with the status quo.
It should be clear for both Israelis and the (Palestinian) government that the final status negotiations will be conducted by the presidency and the Palestine Liberation Organization, he said.
Abbas pointed out that his scheduled February 19 meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would focus on final status issues, a reference to East Jerusalem, refugees, frontiers and settlements.
Olmert told a cabinet meeting earlier Sunday that his government neither accepted nor rejected the Mecca deal but said that the Israeli cabinet was studying the details of the agreement.
Abbas was expected to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah II prior to meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin Tuesday in Amman.
US military officials for the first time Sunday offered what they claimed was proof that Iran has been providing weapons and explosives to armed groups in Iraq, according to US media reports.
In briefing with reporters Sunday in Baghdad, US officials put on display rocket-propelled grenades and mortar shells bearing what they said were serial numbers from Iranian manufacturing. 
Explosives canisters designed to piece armoured military vehicles were also shown.
US officials claimed that the specialized explosives first appeared in Iraq in 2004, and that a shipment of the canisters being smuggled from Iran was captured in 2005, The New York Times reported.
During the briefing, the US alleged that Iranian security forces were sending such the arms into Iraq to target US and Iraqi government forces on order from the highest levels in Tehran, the Washington Post reported.
Reporters were admitted to the briefing on condition of anonymity for the US officials involved, and no photographs or recordings of any kind were allowed. 
The briefing including a US explosives expert and an intelligence analyst, neither of whom normally speaks to reporters.
Iran is a significant contributor to attacks on coalition forces, one US official said.
Sri Lanka's navy destroyed a Tamil Tiger boat Monday and captured another off the eastern coastal town of Trincomalee, the defence ministry said.
A naval patrol in the area detected the two Sea Tiger attack craft while they were cruising towards the southern part of Sri Lanka along the eastern shoreline.
Naval fast attack craft destroyed one boat and disabled the other craft, making it possible for the navy to capture it, Navy spokesman Commander D. P. K. Dassanayake said.
The navy recovered two bodies including one female Tiger rebel after the attack, he said, adding that several weapons were also recovered.
Each boat was manned by around four people. 
Dassanayake said the fate of the remaining six was unknown.
Elsewhere on the island, suspected Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) rebels gunned down a Sinhalese civilian driver in the northern town of Vavuniya late Sunday.
The victim was driving his three-wheeler taxi at the time the shooting took place, the defence ministry said.
More than 60,000 people have died in the 35-year-old ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, where the LTTE is fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils.
Fighting has escalated between troops and Tamil Tigers in the past year, killing more than 3,800 people, despite a truce that has been in place since February 2002.
India will next month share with Pakistan the results of its investigation into the bombing of a cross-border train that killed 68 people this week, Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee said Wednesday.
The minister said the information will be shared when the two sides meet in Islamabad for a joint antiterror mechanism on March 6.
As the blasts occurred on a train connecting New Delhi with the northern Pakistani city of Lahore, many had speculated that they were meant to disrupt.
But both countries have condemned the blasts and reaffirmed their commitment to the peace process. 
US Vice President Dick Cheney Tuesday called for resolution of a row over North Korea's abductions of Japanese civilians, which has prevented Tokyo from fully supporting a nuclear deal with Pyongyang.
We want to see a resolution of the tragic case of Japanese abductees, Cheney told reporters as he entered talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
North Korea has admitted kidnapping Japanese civilians in the 1970s and 1980s to train its spies. 
It returned five of them and their families in 2002 but insists others are dead.
Japan has refused to fund a six-nation deal last week on shutting North Korea's nuclear facilities until the row is resolved.
Denmark was poised to announce a timetable for the withdrawal of its troops from Iraq at a press conference on Wednesday,the Danish news agency Ritzau reported.
Ritzau did not provide a source for its information and there was no reaction from the Danish government since British Prime Minister Tony Blair was reported to be preparing an announcement on withdrawing British troops in Iraq.
Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller were to hold a press conference at 1:30pm, the government said in a statement.
The statement gave no further details on the press conference but, according to Ritzau, Rasmussen was to outline a timetable for the troop withdrawals.
Denmark has 470 soldiers stationed in Iraq, including 415 in Basra in the south of the country under British command. 
Six Danish soldiers have been killed in Iraq since 2003.
One Spanish soldier was killed and two were wounded when their convoy was attacked in southern Afghanistan, the defence ministry said on Wednesday.
Hamas on Wednesday said it took the Middle East Quartet's stance on a possible unity government as progress, though the international group stopped short of endorsing the Hamas-Fatah agreement.
The Quartet meeting hasn't talked about imposing embargo on the new national unity government, Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad said. 
I believe that there was a progress in the committee's stance towards the new government.
President Mahmoud Abbas designated Ismail Haniya to form a new national coalition after Abbas, Haniya and leaders of rival Fatah and Islamic Hamas movements agreed to an alliance in Mecca earlier this month.
However, the Quartet which consists of the United States, UN, Russia and European Union reiterated its demand that a Palestinian unity government abide by its conditions to recognize Israel, renounce violence and adhere to past international agreements.
Whether the new government will meet those conditions remains unclear. 
We observe with concerns what was issued by the Quartet during its meeting held in Berlin. 
We believe that there has been a change in the position of the Quartet that could open the door towards positive cooperation, Hamad said.
He said that some of the Quartet members' support to forming the national unity government, referring to Russia and the European Union, and  avoiding the use of embargo language is encouraging.
We look forward towards full cooperation after the formation of the new government, Hamad said, adding this positive position would leave the door opened for more positive steps in the future.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had earlier said that Washington had not yet decided on whether it would recognize the planned Palestinian unity government and planned to take a wait and see approach.
There isn't a Palestinian unity government to support at the moment, Rice said after the meeting in Berlin of the Mideast Quartet consisting of the United States, the UN, Russia and the European Union.
Desperate Housewives star Marcia Cross has given birth to twin girls the first children for the actress and her stockbroker husband Tom Mahoney, People magazine reported on Wednesday.
Publicists for the 44-year-old redhead told the magazine that the twins, named Eden and Savannah, were born at a Los Angeles hospital on Tuesday and both mother and babies were doing well.
Cross had been placed on bed rest by her doctors in January for the remainder of her pregnancy, forcing production of the ABC network hit TV show to move to her real-life Los Angeles living room.
Cross plays the perfectionist Bree in Desperate Housewives and her expanding waistline had become harder to conceal during the last two episodes planned for her in the current season.
Sudan and Chad agreed on Wednesday to strengthen implementation of an existing deal to end the violence that has spilled over from Darfur onto their borders, a Sudanese presidential adviser said.
Majzoub Al-Khalifa, an adviser to Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, told reporters the agreement was struck at a meeting of the leaders of Sudan, Chad, Libya and Eritrea that sought to end violence in Sudan's Darfur region.
What came out of this meeting is the normalisation of relations between Sudan and Chad and enhancement of the implementation of the previous Tripoli Agreement and the return of normal life to both countries, said Khalifa.
He said mechanisms of observation would be set up to monitor any attempt to smuggle weapons across the frontier.
Violence in Darfur has expanded into Chad, which accuses Sudan of supporting rebels launching cross-border attacks that have exacerbated ethnic tensions and triggered a flood of refugees.
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has been pressing Chad and Sudan to settle their differences as part of international efforts to bring peace to Darfur.
In February 2006, Sudan's Bashir and Chad President Idriss Deby agreed to end the crisis in the so-called Tripoli Agreement requiring they stop insurgents setting up bases on their territories and end propaganda against one another. 
In November 2006 they pledged to redouble efforts to repair their frayed ties.
Chad continued to accuse Sudan of sending Janjaweed militia across the frontier and of arming and directing rebels trying to overthrow Deby. 
Sudan's government denies this.
Wednesday's attempt to mend the Sudan-Chad rift was part of a wider effort by Gaddafi to tackle the Darfur conflict, scene of one of the world's worst humanitarian crises with an estimated 200,000 people killed and 2.5 million driven from homes since 2003.
The meeting, which also included Eritrean leader Isaias Afewerki, had been aimed at enticing the National Redemption Front rebel coalition to join a 2006 peace deal between Khartoum and a faction of the former rebel Sudan Liberation Movement.
Divisions among Darfur's rebel factions have been a factor in delaying an effective peace deal with Khartoum. 
One of the main factions complained on Wednesday it had not been invited to the talks in Libya and dismissed them as a charade.
The spiral of violence in Darfur has been slowed only by a huge humanitarian operation, which aid workers warn is increasingly under threat.
Washington calls the violence genocide, a term European governments are reluctant to use and which Khartoum rejects.
Al-Bashir has resisted pressure to authorise deployment of thousands of U.N. peacekeepers to support a 7,000-strong African Union mission in Darfur. 
Scientists who have proposed a controversial theory that surgery to remove a breast tumor may actually help the cancer to spread said on Wednesday their ideas may also explain why black women have been more likely to die of breast cancer in the past.
While they stressed that women should always get screening and quick treatment for breast cancer, they said their theory could also help explain the belief, widespread in parts of Africa and the United States, that removing a tumor can hasten death.
I must say that I am sure there is more to this than just a myth, said Michael Retsky of Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. 
His latest hypothesis, which he admits is not supported by any new direct research, is published in the International Journal of Surgery.
He stressed that any woman with breast cancer should get the tumor removed. 
And he noted that in the United States, the women who could be considered at risk of having their cancer spread now get chemotherapy anyway, which would stop cancer's spread.
At this time we are not suggesting any change in clinical practice. 
We think this is a subject that needs far more research, Retsky, who has worked with other scientists in South Carolina and Italy, said in a telephone interview.
The American Cancer Society also stressed that women should always get mammograms, and questioned the theory.
No woman should delay getting treatment for breast cancer, oncologist Dr. Len Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society said in a telephone interview.
What we do know is that by early detection, we find the cancer early, we have less risk of lymph node involvement, we have greatly improved the outlook for women with breast cancer, Lichtenfeld added.
Whether or not the theory is correct, I have difficulty with the logic that they employed to get there.
Retsky and colleagues studied several databases on women who have had breast cancer surgery. 
They published one study in 2005 suggesting that surgery might cause the activation of tiny tumors that had already spread.
Retsky believes there may be two mechanisms at work. 
One idea is that surgery itself, by wounding the body, causes it to produce growth factors that fuel the growth of the other, tiny tumors.
The other holds that a primary, or main tumor, secretes some sort of factor that holds the other tumors in check. When the main tumor is removed, the smaller tumors which had already spread are free to grow.
This creates the appearance that the cancer has come back, and with a vengeance.
These factors are known as anti-angiogenesis factors. 
Angiogenesis means the development of blood vessels, and several new cancer drugs employ anti-angiogenesis factors, literally starving tumors of their blood supply.
However, black U.S. women are diagnosed with breast cancer at an average age of 46, versus 57 for white women, he noted. 
Their higher death rate first appeared in the mid-1970s, just when mammography for early detection was introduced.
It might be that some black women have a genetic tendency to a particular form of breast cancer that becomes more aggressive after surgery, Retsky said.
When we looked for breast cancer in Africans, a common word that shows up is aggressive, he said.
Brazil banned the sale and transfer of nuclear equipment and technology to Iran on Thursday, citing a United Nations resolution on Tehran's uranium enrichment program.
Brazil began enriching uranium in 2004 and is one of a few countries with the full cycle of technology to make nuclear fuel. 
It operates two domestic nuclear power plants but does not have a nuclear weapons program.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a decree that prohibits the transfer of nuclear technology to Iran and freezes financial assets with links to Iran's nuclear program.
The decree, published in the official gazette, cited a U.N. Security Council resolution in December that called on Iran to suspend its nuclear enrichment program by Feb. 21.
The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Thursday that Iran failed to meet the deadline and was expanding research-level enrichment of nuclear fuel into industrial scale production.
Brazil, which has large uranium reserves in the Amazon, is banned by its constitution from conducting nuclear weapons research. 
It is a signatory nation to the Non-proliferation Treaty.
Western powers must end their boycott of the Palestinian government in the wake of the power-sharing pact signed by Hamas and Fatah, a representative of the Palestinian presidency said Thursday.
Speaking at a conference between Spanish diplomats and representatives from 19 Arab League countries held in Madrid, Nabil Shaath called the boycott unjust and illegal and said it imposed a collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
If the boycott is not lifted it will be difficult to justify the agreement reached by the Islamist Hamas movement and the more moderate Fatah of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas earlier this month in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to form a new Palestinian government, he added.
The so-called Quartet of Mideast negotiators the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia imposed an economic embargo on the Palestinian government after January 2006 parliamentary elections in which Hamas ousted Fatah from power.
The boycott led to widespread economic hardship in the Palestinian territories and growing unease in Europe over the measures.
A meeting of the Quartet in Germany on Wednesday ended with the major powers saying they would await the formation of the new Palestinian unity government before deciding whether to lift aid and diplomatic embargoes.
Hamas does not recognize Israel and is considered a terrorist organisation in the West.
Watching television disrupts children's' normal response to food they will eat more while they're sitting in front of the tube, whether or not they're really hungry.
These data, combined with those from other studies, support recommendations to reduce television watching and restrict eating while watching television as part of a healthy lifestyle, Dr. Jennifer L. Temple and colleagues from the University at Buffalo, New York, conclude.
Temple and her team looked at how television affected habituation to food cues. 
Habituation is the phenomenon that occurs when a person repeatedly provided with a food will eventually lose interest and stop eating it once they are full.
Providing a new, unfamiliar food can disrupt this process, and a person will start eating again even if they're not hungry. 
Non-food stimuli may also disrupt habituation if a person's attention is distracted.
In the first experiment, the researchers had 30 normal-weight kids ranging in age from 9 to 12 perform a computer task to earn points to eat food. 
The task consisted of 10 two-minute time blocks. 
For the first 7 blocks, kids worked for points to eat half a junior cheeseburger. 
For the final 3, some children continued to work for pieces of cheeseburger, others worked for French fries, and the third group worked for cheeseburgers while watching television.
While the kids who didn't watch television and were continually offered cheeseburgers as rewards eventually lost interest in the food, the children offered French fries and those who finished the task while watching television started eating again, the researchers found.
The television group and the French fry group spent more time responding to the computer task and consumed more calories than the third group confined to the same food without the distraction of television.
In the second experiment, researchers provided children with 1,000 calories worth of a favorite snack food and told them they could eat as much or as little as they wanted. 
Some of the children watched a 23-minute television show, others watched a 1.5-minute repeating loop of a television show, and the rest didn't watch television.
The researchers theorized that the repeating television loop would not require the children's constant attention.
The children watching the continuous television show consumed more calories (500) and spent more time eating (21 minutes) than the television-loop and the no-television groups combined, the researchers found.
Given that kids tend to eat high-calorie foods when watching television, snacks in front of the tube have the potential to profoundly affect how many calories children consume, even if the time they spend snacking is short, the researchers note.
They call for additional research to determine whether television's effect on habituation is different for normal-weight and overweight kids.
US Vice President Dick Cheney on Friday warned that the United States and ally Australia simply cannot indulge thoughts of an early withdrawal from Iraq as it would spawn a new wave of global terror.
Cheney, launching a two-day visit to key US ally Australia, praised Prime Minister John Howard's staunch support of the US-led war and its fight against terror, saying the only option for survival was to fight back ferociously.
As Britain announced a decrease in its troop numbers in Iraq and countries such as Denmark prepare to pull out of the coalition, he linked victory in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with stemming a global tide of terrorism.
The notion that free countries can turn our backs on what happens in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, or any other possible safe haven for terrorists is an option we simply cannot indulge, Cheney said in a speech in Sydney.
We are determined to prevail in Iraq because we understand the consequences of failure. 
If our coalition withdrew before Iraqis could defend themselves, radical factions would battle for dominance over the country, he said.
Evoking the spectre of September 11, Cheney repeated the US goal of transforming Iraq into a stable democracy to avoid a spread of violence and extremist violence throughout the Middle East and the world. 
As support for the war in the United States and countries such as Australia in Iraq sinks to new lows amid spiralling violence, he said the only option for survival was to take the fight to the terrorists.
We've never had a fight like this and it's not a fight we can win using the strategies from other wars. 
An enemy that operates in the shadows and views the entire world as a battlefield is not one that can be contained or deterred.
In the war against terror, one side will win and the other will lose. 
Civilisation will continue its upward course, or go in a different direction, he said.
Cheney arrived in Sydney late Thursday for a visit officially aimed at thanking its ally for its support since war erupted in Iraq four years ago.
But the trip comes at an awkward time for Howard, who Cheney was due to meet for talks on Saturday, as he faces falling popularity numbers over Australia's role in the Iraq conflict.
Canberra has a relatively small contingent of around 1,400 troops in and around Iraq and Howard has rebuffed calls for a withdrawal, saying that would hand victory to terrorists and betray its ally in Washington.
Later on Friday, Cheney is due to meet Australian opposition leader Kevin Rudd, who has called for a staged withdrawal of Australian troops from Iraq.
The Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference Prof. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu sought the urgent intervention of the international community to protect Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem from Israeli aggression. 
He also reiterated the need for a unified Muslim stance to stop heinous Israeli actions against the holy mosque and other Muslim holy sites. 
Prof. Ihsanoglu made these remarks in his presidential speech at the Expanded Extraordinary Session of OIC's Executive Committee at the Foreign Ministers' Level at the headquarters of OIC here today.   
The OIC chief underlined the need for taking bold position to prevent aggression on the heritage of culture and humanity in various parts of the world. 
The world should intervene actively to stop aggression on the holy sites of 1.5 billion Muslims, he said. 
Prof. Ihsanoglu recalled that Palestinian issue was the main reason for the establishment of OIC, 37 years ago. 
The OIC, which groups 57 Muslim countries, was formally established in September 1969 after the burning of the Al Aqsa Mosque. 
Prof. Ihsanoglu called upon member countries to pledge financial aid to the Al Aqsa Fund to help Palestinians in their efforts to stop the Israeli crimes. 
Israel's excavations at the Magharba Gate, one of the gateways to Al Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, were in grave violation of international laws that prohibited the distortion of natural, demographic, and urban structures, he said. 
Voicing grave concern over the silence of the international community on Israel's moves to Judaize Jerusalem, he called on the world to take steps to protect the culture and history in Jerusalem.
The OIC chief briefed the participants on the efforts being made by the organization in protecting Al Aqsa Mosque and other Muslim holy sites. 
He also lauded the efforts being made by Saudi Arabia in supporting Muslim causes. 
Prof. Ihsanoglu praised Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz for his successful initiative that resulted in concluding historic peace deal between Hamas and Fatah and ending infighting between Palestinian factions.
In his opening speech, Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov, who is also chairman of the OIC Executive Committee, called on the world community to exert efforts for ensuring protection of Al Aqsa Mosque. 
The foreign ministers are examining the latest developments in the occupied Palestinian territories, in the wake of the ongoing Israeli excavations and demolitions in the vicinity of Al Aqsa Mosque. 
They are discussing ways to halt these violations that represent flagrant infringement to the Muslim sanctities, the international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
The issue has already triggered Muslim outrage across the world.  
Prof. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, expressed his anguish and dismay at the world's silence on Israeli moves to Judaize Jerusalem and change the holy city's historic character. 
When the Buddhist statues were being demolished in Bamiyan, the whole world rose up against the Taleban regime in Afghanistan. 
UNESCO was very active then, but not a word is being said against what Israel is doing to the Al Aqsa Mosque. 
Nobody utters a word against the Israeli aggression. 
Nobody is really taking any action, there is silence all over, he said in an interview with Arab News daily.
Prof. Ihsanoglu said the excavation work being carried out by Israel constituted the gravest threat ever to one of Islam's three holiest mosques. 
What we are watching today is the gravest threat because we are living in an age of globalization - in a world where everybody knows everything in real time, Ihsanoglu said. 
In the Middle Ages and during the Crusades, nobody knew what was going on. 
It took days and weeks and even months for news to trickle to the other quarters of the world.
The OIC chief said what was happening in Jerusalem was nothing new. 
This has been the case ever since Israel occupied Palestine. 
The Jewish State has always wanted to change the nature of Al Quds and the holy site. 
He said everybody was asking Hamas and the Palestinians to comply with the conditions of the Quartet (Russia, the United Nations, United States and the European Union). 
But nobody is asking Israel to comply with international law and with international conventions. 
As to whether some Muslim countries were in touch with Israel on the Al Aqsa issue, Ihsanoglu said: The only initiative that I know of is the Turkish initiative in which Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed with the Israeli prime minister the issue of sending a technical, fact-finding mission to Al Quds Al Shareef to see the excavation work for itself. 
Apart from that initiative, I am unaware of any attempt to put pressure on Israel by OIC countries that have diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv.
As for approaching the United Nations, Ihsanoglu said: Yes, we have already done this. 
Two weeks ago, I was in Paris. 
I had a meeting with OIC ambassadors and UNESCO, and we had a long discussion. 
I had a meeting with OIC ambassadors and UNESCO, and we had a long discussion. 
Prof. Ihsanoglu said he had asked OIC ambassadors in New York to do the same. 
They had already proposed a strong resolution condemning the Israeli activities and Israeli aggression. 
Our ambassadors met UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and conveyed our message to him.    
The OIC ambassadors contacted the Quartet. 
We've conveyed to them the concerns of the Muslim world. We are doing everything that we can, but I think more needs to be done. 
The OIC Secretary General said Muslims the world over should continue to apply pressure on their respective governments. 
But we should not resort to any violence. 
We should always consider peaceful measures. 
We should refrain from any extremist action. 
The best that can be done by the masses is to shape world opinion. 
They should express strong concern and worries about what is happening to Al Aqsa Mosque and ask their governments to put pressure on countries that have access to Israel, that have leverage with Israel and also to coordinate the efforts in the United Nations and UNESCO, he added.
Sri Lanka and the rebel Tamil Tigers mark the fifth anniversary of their truce on Friday just a day after the guerrilla group said the deal was all but dead and that their freedom struggle would go on.
The pact, brokered by Norway in 2002, was meant to end a deadly conflict that has claimed more than 60,000 lives on this island nation in the past 35 years.
But the deal has collapsed amid an ongoing cycle of violence, with the government blaming the rebels and the Tigers, who have been fighting for an independent Tamil homeland, saying Colombo is responsible for the bloodshed.
Nearly 4,000 people have been killed since the ceasefire was agreed, and the rebels said late Thursday after the navy said it had sunk two suspected rebel boats, killing at least nine that the truce was effectively over.
Even though today it exists only on paper, it remains a unique document in the search for an end to the national conflict in the island of Sri Lanka, the Tigers said in a statement.
They warned that the government's military drive against them would only add to the bloodstained pages of the island's history.
It has also compelled the Tamil people to resume their freedom struggle to realise their right to self-determination and to achieve statehood, the Tigers said.
Norway's top peacebroker in the process, Erik Solheim, offered Thursday to try to revive peace talks, even as thousands of Sinhalese nationalists took to the streets in the capital Colombo calling for the truce to be scrapped.
It is my strong hope that both parties will recognise the need to secure the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement as a first step toward reaching a political solution, Solheim said in a statement.
Norway is willing to go the extra mile to assist their peace endeavours at their request, he said. 
As soon as the parties renew their peace efforts, we will be ready to do all we can to help.
Security forces also launched ground attacks against Tiger rebels Thursday as the guerrillas said thousands of civilians in the north had fled their homes in fear of an upsurge of fighting.
Military officials confirmed they were retaliating against rebel harassment, but said there was no major offensive in the region.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said thousands of men, women and children from half a dozen villages along the de facto border between the two sides were on the move, seeking refuge deeper inside rebel territory.
On Wednesday, 25 Tamil civilians carrying white flags entered a government-held area in the northern district of Vavuniya and were provided with shelter and food by the troops, a military official said.
An exodus of civilians from the island's troubled regions is usually a first sign of stepped-up fighting between troops and the rebels.
Senior British government officials fear that US President George W. Bush will attack Iran before his final term in office ends in a little less than two years time, The Times reported on Friday.
They fear that Bush will seek to settle the Iranian question through military means, the daily reported, quoting unidentified senior British government sources.
He (Bush) will not want to leave it unresolved for his successor, one of the sources told The Times.
The reports follow comments made on Thursday by British Prime Minister Tony Blair who insisted there is no planning under way for an attack on Iran, and added that he knew of nobody in Washington who was planning an invasion either.
You can't absolutely predict every set of circumstances that comes about but sitting here now talking to you, I can tell you Iran is not Iraq, Blair told BBC Radio.
There is, as far as I know, no planning going on to make an attack on Iran and people are pursuing a diplomatic and political solution for a good reason that it is the only solution that anyone can think of as viable and sensible.
Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett also said on Thursday that Britain remained committed to a negotiated solution and would now consult with its international partners to find a way to prevent Iran acquiring the means to develop nuclear weapons.
Iran has failed to comply with a United Nations Security Council demand to halt uranium enrichment, according to a report issued by Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the IAEA.
Britain is set to announce that it is sending up to 1,000 extra troops to Afghanistan, according to media reports Friday.
Britain's Defence Secretary Des Browne is likely to give further details in a statement to lawmakers in the House of Commons Monday, the BBC and the Guardian newspaper said.
The announcement would come just days after Prime Minister Tony Blair told the Commons that 1,600 British troops were being withdrawn from Iraq as increasing responsibility was handed to domestic security forces.
NATO has 35,000 troops in Afghanistan, but there have been disputes within the organisation over whether continental European countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain should be contributing more.
Britain currently contributes around 5,000 troops, most of them based in Helmand Province in the south where they are likely to face a resurgent Taliban as snow melt in the coming weeks.
The Guardian said that the extra troops would number 1,000. 
The BBC did not put a figure on the deployment but described it as substantial.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman could not confirm the reports but told AFP, the troops are kept on a constant review.
if we need to make adjustments, we shall do it and make an announcement in the usual way.
The new UN emergency relief coordinator on Monday said he wanted to tour Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) later this month for a first-hand look at the humanitarian crisis spawned by the Darfur conflict.
Holmes, a British former ambassador to France who succeeded Jan Egeland of Norway as UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, said he was currently holding talks with authorities of the three countries regarding a trip planned for March 20 to 31.
I want to get onto the ground soon to see for myself what is happening in some of the critical areas, he told reporters in his first press briefing since taking office March 1.
He noted that problems regarding the safety of displaced people as well as of humanitarian workers are increasing and unacceptable and the problems of access, if anything, are worsening.
Holmes said he hoped during his tour to meet with government officials, humanitarian workers as well as refugees and displaced people living in camps.
The Darfur conflict, which erupted nearly four years ago, has left at least 200,000 people dead and some 2.5 million displaced, according to UN figures. 
Some sources say the death toll is much higher.
The conflict has spilled over in neighboring Chad and CAR.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday vowed never to budge on the issue of North Korea's abductions of Japanese citizens, as the two countries prepared for talks on normalising ties in Hanoi.
Japan has refused to fund a six-nation deal on North Korea's nuclear programme due to the emotive row over the communist regime's kidnappings of Japanese nationals in the 1970s and 1980s.
We will never change our stance unless they do, Abe told parliament.
This is the time when we really have to stand firm, Abe said. 
This is something on which we can never yield.
Abe, who built his career campaigning on the abduction issue, spoke as Japan and North Korea prepared for talks this week in the Vietnamese capital that were arranged under the February 13 nuclear deal.
North Korea admitted in 2002 that it kidnapped 13 Japanese to train its spies in Japanese language and culture. 
It returned five of them and their families but insists the others are dead.
Abe insisted that Japan was not isolated despite its refusal to fund last month's six-nation deal, under which North Korea will receive badly needed fuel aid in exchange for disabling key nuclear facilities.
The United States completely understands and supports Japan's stance China basically understands us. 
So does South Korea, Abe told parliament.
We have won the world's understanding, he added. 
We have to make them realise that North Korea will never be accepted by the international community unless they solve this problem.
The six-way talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and the United States. 
Japan was a major financial backer of a collapsed nuclear deal reached in 1994.
An adviser to South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun will visit North Korea on Wednesday amid reports he may discuss arrangement of a second inter-Korean summit, the adviser's aides said Tuesday.
Lee Hae Chan, who served as prime minister from June 2004 to March 2006, is now serving as a special presidential adviser for political affairs. 
Lee, now a member of the pro-government Uri Party, will arrive in Pyongyang via Shenyang, China, and meet with the North's No. 2 leader Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, Yonhap News Agency quoted Uri Party sources as saying. 
Lee will visit Pyongyang for discussions on establishing a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula and promoting inter-Korean cooperation, a Uri Party official told Yonhap. 
Meanwhile, Unification Minister Lee Jae Joung told local radio that Lee's visit to North Korea is unrelated to any discussions about another inter-Korean summit.
In June 2000, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and then South Korean President Kim Dae Jung held in Pyongyang the first-ever summit between the two Koreas, at which time it was decided that Kim would make a reciprocal visit to the South at an appropriate time.
Japan will cut yen loans to China by 17 percent to 62.3 billion yen for the year to March 31 in line with its policy of ending fresh aid to its giant neighbour by the time of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday.
All of the aid will be devoted to environmental projects, the official said, adding that the decision had been approved by a ruling Liberal Democratic Party panel on foreign aid.
Japan has been reducing its official development aid to China from a peak in 2000/01 in view of its giant neighbour's robust and fast-developing economy. 
The latest drop would mean yen loans are down 71 percent from the peak.
You could say that the role of such aid for economic infrastructure is coming to an end, the official said.
Concerns about China's double-digit growth in defence spending have been another factor behind the decline.
China said on Sunday that it that it would boost defence spending by 17.8 percent in 2007, accelerating its string of annual double-digit increases in money to modernise its military.
Japan and its close security ally, the United States, have repeatedly expressed concerns about China's defence spending and called for greater clarity about the budget and its aims.
The Japanese government decides its total aid budget before the start of each fiscal year in April. 
But usually does notdecide the final breakdown until the end of the fiscal year. 
Last year, Japan delayed a decision on the aid until June because of strains in ties, which had chilled after Junichiro Koizumi became prime minister in 2001 and began visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Beijing as a symbol of past Japanese militarism.
Sino-Japanese relations have warmed since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in September and held ice-breaking summits with Chinese leaders. 
Premier Wen Jiabao is set to come to Tokyo in April on what would be the first visit to Japan by a Chinese prime minister since 2000.
At least 21 people were killed in a devastating fire early Tuesday which swept through a slum in the port city of Chittagong in southern Bangladesh, officials said.
At least 118 Shiite pilgrims were slaughtered in attacks across Iraq on Tuesday, sparking fears of reprisals that could frustrate efforts by Iraqi and US forces to quell sectarian violence.
The deadliest single attack was in Hilla, south of the capital, where two suicide bombers triggered explosives amid a packed crowd of worshippers walking to the holy city of Karbala, police Lieutenant Karim al-Hamzawi said.
Dr Mohammed Timini from Hilla Hospital's emergency room said 90 pilgrims were killed and at least 160 wounded, as queues of ambulances and private cars brought in scores of bloodied bodies.
Among the wounded, there are 50 in a critical condition. 
Eighty percent of the casualties are young men, but there are women and children among the dead, he told AFP at the hospital.
Tens of thousands of Shiites are making their way to Karbala, a shrine city around 100 kilometres south of Baghdad, for the Arbaeen ceremony on Friday, despite threats from Sunni militants.
Most of them are going on foot, leaving them vulnerable to attack.
Arbaeen marks 40 days after Ashura, the holiest day on the Shiite calendar, commemorating the killing in 680 of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, by armies of the Sunni caliph Yazid.
The Hilla bombings triggered fury amid the local Shiite population, and there was gunfire as militants accused government security forces of failing to protect the marchers from Sunni extremists.
Elsewhere in Iraq, separate attacks killed at least 28 more Shiites.
In Baghdad, eight pilgrims died when their minibus was raked with bullets by unknown gunmen in the Sunni district of Dura, while 15 more were killed and 47 wounded in three separate car bombings in other parts of the city.
Another five were gunned down in two attacks near Latifiyah, south of the capital. 
At least 15 more were wounded.
Sri Lanka's police said on Tuesday it has arrested policemen and soldiers as well as underworld figures in connection with a rash of killings and abductions in the latest chapter of the two-decade civil war.
The admission comes as the government faces mounting pressure from human rights groups and foreign governments to halt rights abuses blamed on elements of the military as well as Tamil Tiger rebels and renegades and after the discovery of five corpses in the island's north.
The magnitude of the problem is yet to be assessed. 
But the fact remains there are a few groups like this operating, Asoka Wijetilleke, Deputy Inspector General of the police's foreign intelligence department, told a news conference.
Some of them, which include ex-soldiers, serving soldiers, police officers and underworld gangs and other organised elements have been arrested, he added. 
That does not mean we have fully and completely investigated the whole thing.
Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission says nearly 100 abductions and disappearances have been reported to them so far this year in the capital Colombo, eastern district of Batticaloa and the besieged northern Jaffna peninsula.
That in turn comes on top of 1,000 cases reported during 2006 as the island's civil war, which has killed around 68,000 people since 1983, resumed.
Naval forces from nine countries, including the United States, China and Pakistan, began exercises off Pakistan on Tuesday aimed at consolidating efforts in the war against terrorism, a Pakistani official said.
Forces from Britain, Turkey, Italy, France, Malaysia and Bangladesh are also taking part in the week-long Aman (peace) exercise in the Arabian Sea.
These countries are taking part with their forces and ships while we also have observers from 24 countries, said Pakistani navy spokesman Lieutenant Commander Salman Ali.
Ali said the exercise was aimed at increasing cooperation and consolidating security gains.
We also want to project Pakistan as a country contributing to peace and stability in the region, he said.
Pakistan's old rival India has not been invited to take part.
Two U.S. servicemen were killed after the vehicle they were in plunged into a ravine in eastern Ethiopia, the Ethiopian and U.S. governments said on Tuesday.
Another soldier and the Ethiopian driver of the vehicle were also injured in the crash on Monday, the U.S. Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa said in a statement from its base in Djibouti.
The accident occurred when the vehicle in which the Americans were travelling fell into a deep ravine, Commander Demsash Hailu, spokesman for Ethiopia's Federal Police, told Reuters.
The U.S. military did not say what the soldiers were doing. 
But soldiers from the task force, which handles counter-terrorism in the region, often train local militaries and carry out civil improvement projects in poor areas.  
The crash took place about 48 km southwest of Hurso, which is 170 km west of the border with of Somaliland, the breakaway Somali enclave. 
The injured serviceman was flown to a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, on Tuesday morning and was in stable condition. 
The Ethiopian driver was in serious condition at a French hospital in Djibouti. 
The U.S. military is convening an investigation board to determine the cause of the accident, the statement said.
The military did not release the names of the soldiers pending notification of family.
Hundreds of foreign fighters are in southern Afghanistan helping the Taliban wage war against the government and its allies, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said Tuesday.
The foreign fighters are mainly from countries in Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, ISAF spokesman Colonel Tom Collins told reporters.
They numbered in the hundreds and some were linked to Al-Qaeda, he said.
Basically they are jihadists who have come here to wage combat against foreign forces and the government, he told AFP.
ISAF earlier announced the start of its biggest operation yet with Afghan forces, aimed at Taliban extremists, narco-traffickers and foreign fighters in the southern province of Helmand.
The Taliban, which was in government between 1996 and 2001, are said to have teamed up with opium smugglers in areas where they can profit from the government's lack of authority.
Collins said the hardcore of the Taliban those who believed in the movement's extremist ideology numbered in the high hundreds in Helmand although it was difficult to pin down figures.
They were however able to rally support from men who would fight just for the money, he said.
Part of Operation Achilles under way in Helmand was to separate the two and assert government authority so reconstruction and aid groups could enter the area to begin development work, he said.
Two African peacekeepers were kidnapped and then killed and one seriously wounded following an attack in Sudan's western region of Darfur by the only rebel faction to have signed a peace deal, the African Union said on Tuesday.
Two AU Protection Force soldiers were abducted and subsequently killed, it said in a statement.
The attack left a third soldier critically wounded. It took place on Monday in Gereida in the province of South Darfur.
This deplorable and condemnable act was perpetrated by gunmen believed to be elements belonging to the SLM/A faction of Minni Minnawi, who signed a peace agreement with the government in May 2006.
This brought to 11 the number of AU peacekeepers killed in Darfur since the force was deployed there in 2004. 
Another soldier has been missing for months.
Eight Saudi policemen were killed when their helicopter went down in Wadi al-Dawasir, a city in the south of the country, an Interior Ministry official said on Tuesday.
He said the crash was an accident and it took place late on Monday, but did not give cause.
All on board were killed, the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told Reuters without giving details.
Helicopter crashes are common in the kingdom and usually reported by the official news agency SPA. 
UN chief Ban Ki-moon expressed outrage at the slaughter of at least 118 Shiite pilgrims in attacks across Iraq Tuesday and urged better protection of civilians and dialogue across sectarian lines.
The Secretary-General is outraged by the series of bomb attacks in Iraq today on Shia pilgrims who were making their way to the holy city of Karbala, his spokeswoman Michele Montas said in a statement.
Ban condemns these heinous acts, which appear to be aimed at provoking sectarian strife, the statement added.
The secretary general also appealed for maximum restraint in the face of these criminal actions, and urged Iraqi political and religious leaders to exert their influence to protect civilian lives and to promote mutual respect and dialogue between all Iraqi communities.
Tuesday's mayhem included a double suicide bombing on a street crowded with worshippers that claimed 90 lives in Hilla, south of Baghdad.
The attacks marked one of the bloodiest days since the start of a US-led security plan designed to quell sectarian violence, and triggered fears of reprisal attacks by Shiite militiamen on Sunni targets.
Venezuelan authorities closed an airport on the tourist Caribbean island of Margarita on Tuesday after a bomb threat to a Martinair plane that landed there with more than 100 passengers, officials said.
They said it was the second time in two days there had been a threat involving a plane at the airport in what they said was an attempt to damage the South American nation's tourism industry.
The passengers deplaned and authorities were scouring the plane that arrived from the Netherlands in case there was a bomb on board, the officials said.
Government forces in a provincial capital in the Central African Republic aided by French paratroopers have recaptured an airport occupied by rebels, according to French military authorities Tuesday.
About 100 troops of the combined force were able to secure the city of Birao, capital of Vakaga prefecture in the north-eastern Central African Republic, the French military high command in Paris announced.
The French paratroopers were inserted in a high-altitude night jump from a height of more than 3,000 metres.
The rebels had driven government troops out of the airport grounds on Sunday and attacked a unit of French military trainers. 
In response, French reinforcements were dropped into the area and several rebel vehicles were destroyed in airstrikes.
The airport was retaken without resistance.
After the military operation, 18 wounded African troops were evacuated.
Arab nations have protested over Israel's first hint of a nuclear arsenal to the U.N. atomic watchdog, saying this flouts international commitments to a nuclear arms-free zone in the Middle East, diplomats said.
An Arab statement to the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors this week faulted the IAEA's provision of aid for nuclear energy in Israel even though the country had never joined a treaty banning development of atom bombs.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert raised a stir in December, when he implied Israel had nuclear arms, seemingly straying from a longtime policy of strategic ambiguity meant to deter potential Arab and Islamic foes, including Iran.
Olmert's remark represents a new confirmation of international and Arab suspicions about Israel's military nuclear capabilities, said the declaration by 15 Arab states and the Palestinian Authority, obtained by Reuters.
This is a clear violation of the will of the international community for a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the volatile Middle East, it said.
The statement cited past resolutions by the IAEA and one passed by the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference in 1995 and endorsed by the United States, Russia and Britain.
Olmert's comments, it said, underscored the danger that threatens international peace and security so long as the international community remains incapable of inducing Israel to accede to the NPT, to which all Arab states have acceded.
This clearly shows a policy of double standards based on political interests is being followed in the Middle East.
Israel's Foreign Ministry declined comment. 
An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters, 
I think this is done routinely by the Arabs.
The Arab statement urged the IAEA to reconsider its nuclear aid projects in the Jewish state as long as it did not join the NPT and subject its nuclear facilities to IAEA inspections.
The IAEA's secretariat has frozen many such projects in Iran, an NPT member, to uphold U.N. sanctions slapped on Tehran prompted by suspicions it may be trying to secretly build atom bombs, and its stonewalling of IAEA investigations.
Israel is widely believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal around 200 bombs. 
Some Israeli and U.S. officials have mooted possible military action against Iran if diplomacy and sanctions fail to curb its nuclear activity.
Iran insists its nuclear fuel programme is for civilian electricity only. 
It has often complained of being punished while Israel, its arch-foe, has faced no pressure over its presumed nuclear arsenal and shunning of the NPT.
This is not a matter of point-scoring for Iran's benefit. 
But we want to demonstrate to Israel that this issue won't just fade away and to remind the international community of its responsibilities, said a senior Arab diplomat in Vienna.
Jordan's King Abdullah II will push an Arab-backed initiative on securing a lasting peace in the Middle East and urge the United States to get more involved in the process when he addresses a joint session of Congress on Wednesday.
Abdullah was also to meet with US President George W Bush Tuesday evening and held talks on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the war in Iraq with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Monday.
The Jordanian king urged Rice to support the Arab peace plan first launched by Saudi Arabia in 2002, which promises recognition of Israel by Arab neighbouring states in return for a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, according to a statement released by the Jordanian embassy in Washington.
The United States continues to back a separate peace plan put forward in 2003 by the so-called Middle East Quartet made up of the US, EU, UN and Russia but has praised the Arab initiative for its willingness to recognize the Jewish state.
Talks between Israel and the Palestinians have stalled since the Palestinian militant movement Hamas took over power in March 2006 after winning legislative elections.
The US and Europe suspended aid to the Palestinian Authority until Hamas recognizes Israel, renounces violence and supports previous Palestinian agreements.
Abdullah told Rice that growing international interest in regional peace-making is an opportunity that the United States could capitalize on to bring Palestinians and Israelis back to the negotiating table, the Jordanian embassy said.
Abdullah would also push that message when he speaks before Congress Wednesday.
The first visiting head of state to address the legislative chamber since Democrats took over control in November congressional elections.
Rice has said there will be little movement in the process unless a new unity government between Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement recognizes Israel.
Israeli Foregn Minister Tzipi Livni last week said Israel expected Arab nations to adopt changes to their initiative at an upcoming summit, especially over the right of Palestinian refugees to resettle in Israel. 
The Arab initiative was first adopted at the March 2002 Arab League Summit in Beirut the first time Arab nations as a bloc said they were willing to consider recognition of Israel.
The head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees urged the West on Tuesday to stop isolating the Palestinian Authority following an agreement by Hamas and the rival Fatah faction to form a unity government.
It's time to demonstrate the courage ... to abandon the policy of isolation and replace it with an approach that is more conducive to peace and stability, Karen Koning AbuZayd, commissioner-general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said.
Only tragic consequences will follow if we continue along the present path of isolating the Palestinian Authority and arming one side against the other, she said in a speech at the Chatham House think-tank in London.
Rival Palestinian factions, meeting in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, signed a deal on Feb. 8 to form a unity government, hoping to end bloodshed between their followers and win back Western aid cut off after Islamist group Hamas came to power in a January 2006 election.
The deal does not call on the new government to recognise Israel or renounce violence, and includes a vague pledge to respect, rather than accept, interim peace deals.
That falls short of meeting the demands of the Quartet of Middle East mediators, made up of the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations.
U.S. President George W. Bush's administration has made clear its concerns about dealing with a government that includes Hamas.
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said last month, referring to Hamas's rejection of Israel.
Russia broke ranks with its Quartet partners by telling visiting Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal last month it would try to convince the Western powers to lift a crippling aid embargo on the Hamas-led government.
The EU has so far shown little sign of backing away from the Quartet's demands, though it has shown more flexibility than Washington or Israel.
AbuZayd said there were Palestinians who were weary of war. It is to these Palestinians we must appeal, she said.
Abandoning our combative, adversarial approach will restore the credibility of the international community and reassure all sides that it's possible to achieve peace by peaceful means, she said.
AbuZayd also said that donors had so far pledged only $17 million to UNRWA's $246 million emergency appeal for 2007.
The United States will not seek a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, senior officials said Tuesday, asserting the body had lost its credibility with repeated attacks on Israel and a failure to confront other rights abusers.
While we continue to remain very engaged on the issue on human rights within the UN system, whether that is the General Assembly or the Security Council, we do not plan this year to run for the human rights council, said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack.
Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns linked the decision to remain off the year-old council to the 47-member panel's stance on Israel, which he said had discredited the body.
It spent the entire year slamming Israel four separate hearings by the Human Rights Council of the UN on Israel, but not against Burma, and not against Zimbabwe, and not against North Korea and not against Iran, Burns told a congressional hearing.
The council was created over the objections of the United States. 
Which said there were insufficient safeguards to prevent human rights-abusing nations from dominating the group. 
It's members are chosen from among UN states each year.
McCormack did not rule out having Washington run for a seat on the council in future.
If we do come to the day when we decide to run for the Human Rights Council, it will have gotten to the point where it is a credible institution and that we could, in fact, lend our diplomatic weight to the council as a participant, he said.
South Korean Prime Minister Han Myeong Sook resigned Wednesday to return to the pro-government Uri Party after completing 10 months as the country's first female prime minister.
Local news reports said Han may join the race in the party to pick the candidate for December's presidential election.
From now on, I'll be thinking about taking that step, Han told reporters in response to whether she would enter the presidential race, according to a report by Yonhap News Agency.
While I was prime minister, I concentrated on the prime minister's post, she was quoted as saying. 
Now that I am returning to be a politician, I am returning to my original role.
Han had earlier offered to resign as prime minister last month as the president formally was to leave the party and the special National Assembly was to end on Tuesday.
The Uri Party lost its status of the ruling party when President Roh Moo Hyun relinquished his party membership last month.
The Uri Party, which was formed in November 2003 by former democracy activists and supporters of Roh, lost top numerical spot in parliament last month when 23 party lawmakers bolted from the party en masse.
The two front-runners in the presidential race are from the main opposition Grand National Party former Seoul Mayor Lee Myung Bak and Park Geun Hye, former party chairwoman and daughter of the late President Park Chung Hee.
Roh's approval rating has nosedived to around 10 percent, due mainly to the sluggish economy, a string of policy flip-flops and heightened tensions over North Korea's nuclear test conducted last October.
Chief U.S. nuclear negotiator Christopher Hill reasserted his call Tuesday that North Korea should come clean on its alleged uranium enrichment program.
There's a whole list of things that North Korea has been purchasing over the years that are entirely consistent with a highly enriched uranium program, he said, in reference to centrifuges, aluminum tubing and manuals.
I think it's pretty clear we need North Korea to tell us what is in this effort and to explain what these massive purchases of very specialized, extremely expensive equipment are all about, he said during a forum sponsored by the Japan Society in New York.
Hill made the remarks just before the second day of two-day talks on normalizing ties between the United States and North Korea after decades of hostility that followed the 1950-1953 Korean War.
North Korea's alleged research into weapons-grade highly enriched uranium is a key concern for the United States as it seeks to implement the Feb. 13 agreement reached by the six nations discussing ways to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear programs.
Under the pact struck by North and South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia, Pyongyang is committed to closing operations at its Yongbyong nuclear reactor and producing a list of all its nuclear programs.
But Hill had recently admitted to deficiencies in the U.S. government's knowledge about whether North Korea has the technology and material needed to produce highly enriched uranium fuel for nuclear weapons, separate from its plutonium programs.
Japan on Wednesday welcomed the landmark talks between North Korea and the United States, despite its own reservations about a six-nation nuclear disarmament deal with Pyongyang.
Japan said it believed the talks in New York addressed North Korea's kidnappings of Japanese civilians, a key concern for Tokyo.
It is a good thing that the United States and North Korea are talking,  chief government spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki told a news conference.
We heard that they referred to the abduction issue and spent a certain amount of time on the issue, he said.
Christopher Hill, the top US envoy on North Korea, said Tuesday he was optimistic that North Korea will stay on track in the deal, under which it will shut a key nuclear reactor in exchange for fuel aid.
Japan has refused to fund the agreement due to the emotionally charged row over Pyongyang's kidnappings of Japanese nationals in the 1970s and 1980s to train the regime's spies.
Canada's foreign minister promised Tuesday to send 250,000 Canadian dollars to Indonesia after an earthquake struck the South East Asian country.
I wish to extend our sympathies to the families and friends of those affected by this disaster. 
Canada stands ready to assist the government of Indonesia in response to needs identified, Peter MacKay said in a statement.
The 212,000 US dollars will go to local aid groups to meet immediate needs in the areas affected by Tuesday's earthquake, which killed at least 71 people.
Ottawa will remain in touch with the Indonesian government and international aid organizations to evaluate the needs and determine how to help.
MacKay said he is deeply saddened by the quake and offered condolences to relatives and friends of the victims.
Insurgents with guns and a roadside bomb ambushed Shi'ite Muslim pilgrims heading for a religious festival in southern Baghdad on Wednesday, killing five and wounding 10, a police source said.
The attack in the Doura area of the Iraqi capital occurred after nearly 150 pilgrims were killed in a string of attacks on Tuesday. 
A double suicide bombing south of Baghdad killed 115 pilgrims in a busy street.
The attacks on pilgrims occurred just over a year after the bombing of a Shi'ite shrine in the city of Samarra that sparked an upsurge in sectarian violence in Iraq.
Crowds of pilgrims were out on the streets of Baghdad on Wednesday, undaunted by Tuesday's attacks.
The Republic of Korea Prime Minister Han Myeong-sook resigned on Mar. 7 amid speculations that she may join the primary race of the Uri Party for the December 2007 presidential election.
Han wrapped up her 10 months as the country's first female prime minister as the Uri Party woos her in an effort to reinvigorate its profile. Sources said that Han might become presidential candidate of the ruling party.
A candidate for the Prime Ministerial post is former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economy Han Duk Soo.
An earthquake measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale hit an area in western Iran on Wednesday, injuring 35 people, the official news agency IRNA reported.
The quake struck near the town of Doroud in Lorestan province, said IRNA. 
It said some of the injuries were light.
While fleeing during the earthquake and because of windows shattering, some people's bones were broken and some were slightly injured, Doroud Governor Nasrollah Reshnou was quoted as saying.
He said the walls of some houses and shops in Doroud were damaged.
IRNA said some people had set up tents to shelter in.
Natural disaster experts say oil-producing Iran is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world because it is criss-crossed by several major fault lines.
An afternoon session of talks in Hanoi between North Korea and Japan was cancelled, the Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday.
Japanese and North Korean diplomats met in the morning at the Japanese embassy in the Vietnamese capital on the sensitive issue of Pyongyang's abductions of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s.
The meeting is cancelled, a foreign ministry official said, referring to the follow-on meeting due to be held at the North Korean embassy.
No reason was given by the North Koreans, the official said.
The discussions were part of efforts by the two countries to work toward establishing diplomatic relations under an agreement in six-party talks last month by North Korea to start shutting down its nuclear weapons programme in exchange for millions of dollars in energy aid.
Bangladesh is tightening security ahead of the planned execution of six Islamist militants who lost their last chance for clemency when their appeal was rejected by the country's president.
They will be hanged within a month after President Iajuddin Ahmed on Monday rejected their final appeal and ordered them to the gallows.
Prison officials said on Wednesday they were completing preparations for the hangings, but would not disclose the place and time for security reasons.
The curtain will fall soon, said one official who asked not to be named. 
Now this can take place any day.
The six include Shayek Abdur Rahman of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen group and Siddikul Islam Bangla Bhai of Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh. 
Both outlawed groups are fighting to introduce sharia law in Bangladesh, a mainly Muslim democracy.
The six were sentenced to death by the High Court last year for masterminding or involvement in a series of bomb attacks which killed at least 30 people and wounded 150 in 2005.
The victims included judges, lawyers, police and other officials.
The home ministry said security had been beefed up across the country as intelligence reports said followers of the condemned men were regrouping and could strike again.
Bangladesh has been under a state of emergency since January 11, and is run by an interim government until the next election for which no date has yet been set.
The Israeli army seized about 50 Palestinians in a raid on the Palestinian Authority's military intelligence headquarters in Ramallah on Wednesday, Palestinian security sources said.
About 100 army vehicles surrounded the building in the early hours, with the troops threatening to open fire if those inside failed to leave, they said.
The sources said the troops detained about 50 people, while the Israeli army said it had arrested 18 wanted men. 
There were no reports of injuries.
The army arrested 18 Palestinians wanted for attacks and attempted kidnappings of Israeli soldiers and civilians, an army spokesman said, adding that weapons and explosives were also seized.
The Palestinian sources confirmed that 18 people had been arrested. 
An Israeli security source said those arrested were using the infrastructure of the Palestinian security services as a base to carry out their operations.
The Palestinian Authority knew this and did nothing to fight their terrorist activities, the source said.
In January, four people were killed and more than 20 wounded in an Israeli army incursion into central Ramallah to arrest Palestinian militants.
Last week one Palestinian civilian was killed and scores wounded during a multi-day raid by the army in the northern West Bank city of Nablus.
Afghan and coalition forces have killed nine Taliban militants in two separate incidents in troubled southern Afghanistan, officials said Wednesday.
Police ambushed a group of insurgents in the Grishk district of volatile Helmand province on Tuesday, killing five Taliban fighters and confiscating two vehicles, interior ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP.
Separately the Afghan military said four insurgents were killed and one Afghan soldier was wounded on Sunday in a sweep by NATO and Afghan forces in Helmand's Kajaki district.
The joint forces also arrested two insurgents in Kajaki and seized some light weapons.
Kajaki is one of the focal points of a massive NATO and Afghan offensive launched on Tuesday. British troops have for weeks been trying to drive out Taliban from the area so work can begin to restore a major hydropower dam.
Meanwhile Afghan security forces on Sunday arrested a group leader of enemies named as Mullah Mahmood in the Panjwayi district of Kandahar province, where NATO and Taliban forces clashed last year.
The interior ministry's Bashary said Wednesday that Afghan authorities were still trying to verify reports of the abduction of a foreign journalist working for an Italian newspaper, along with two Afghan colleagues.
I can't confirm the abduction of any foreign national, we have no proof so far. 
We have not been contacted by anyone for a missing journalist and our police were not informed of any journalist traveling in the south, he said.
The Taliban claimed Tuesday to have captured a man who said he was working for Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which announced separately that one of its correspondents was missing.
The militants, whose anti-government guerrilla war is at its fiercest since the the Taliban fell in late 2001, have previously executed both foreigners and Afghans whom they accuse of being spies.
Iran will send a deputy foreign minister to a conference on Iraq's security where Tehran will be joined by other neighbouring states and the United States, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Wednesday.
The Iranian delegation will be headed by the deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs (Abbas Araghchi), Mottaki told reporters.
He said Iran would take part in Saturday's conference with the aim of helping the Iraqi government and people.
His comments were the first unequivocal confirmation from Tehran that it will attend the conference, which will provide a rare chance for the United States to sit at the same table as foes such as Iran and Syria.
Italy's political establishment expressed deep concerned Wednesday over the fate of an Italian reporter held by Taliban insurgents in southern Afghanistan.
According to reports, Daniele Mastrogiacomo of Rome-based daily La Repubblica was arrested by the Taliban and accused of spying on behalf of the United States-led coalition while on his way to the Helmand province, where NATO forces have launched a major spring offensive against the insurgents.
Mastrogiacomo, who was initially misidentified as a British reporter, planned to interview Taliban leaders when he was apprehended and taken in for questioning in an undisclosed location along with his Afghan driver and interpreter on Monday.
The reporter's identity was confirmed when a Taliban spokesman contacted Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist, seeking information on their prisoner.
Yusufzai told La Repubblica on Wednesday that he was played a recording over the phone in which a man identified himself as a 52-year-old journalist from Rome.
Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Italy's political leaders expressed unanimous concern over the fate of Mastrogiacomo, one of the country's best and most experienced war correspondents.
The news of his arrest came as parliament was discussing a bill extending the country's peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan until the end of the year. 
The mission is strongly contested by the pacifist wing of Prodi's government.
A vote on the bill, initially scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed until Wednesday.
Mastrogiacomo is the second Italian reporter being held hostage in Afghanistan since November, when freelance photographer Gabriele Torsello was freed three weeks after being abducted in the restive Helmand area by gunmen.
Britain released the name on Wednesday of a Royal Marine killed the previous day in Afghanistan when NATO launched its biggest offensive since 2001 against Taliban guerrillas.
Marine Benjamin Reddy of K Company, 42 Commando Royal Marines was killed when his unit came under fire near the Kajaki hydro-electric power dam in Helmand province, which NATO troops hope to secure in their newly launched Operation Achilles.
Ben Reddy was a dedicated Royal Marine, his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Holmes, said in a statement.
He will be remembered as an honest and unselfish man who was conscientious in his approach to his duties and always worked hard for his friends and colleagues. 
He was always the first to offer assistance or to volunteer, no matter what the associated danger.
Reddy is the 51st British service member to die in Afghanistan since 2001, most of whom have been killed in the past year in Helmand province.
At least 160 Shiite rebel fighters were killed in two weeks of fierce fighting with army forces in the northern Yemeni province of Saada, a military official said Wednesday.
The official, whose name was not published, said in a statement that commanding elements in the outlawed Believing Youth armed group were among those killed in the battles.
The statement, posted on a website run by the defence ministry, did not give the death toll among the army forces.
Saada, some 230 kilometres north of Sana'a, has been the scene of fierce battles between the army and Shiite rebels for more than two months.
Government officials have accused the rebels of trying to topple the republican regime and establish an Islamic state, saying that foreign parties have been supporting them.
Local media reports have recently quoted government officials accusing Iran and Libya of financing the rebels.
Rebels are now under the command of Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the younger brother of the group's founder, Hussein Badruddin al-Houthi.
Hussein was killed in clashes with the army in September 2004. 
Bloody confrontations between the Shiite rebels and the army have since left over 720 government troops dead, according to the official toll. 
Hundreds of rebels were also killed.
Saudi authorities have warned foreign embassies that a group blamed for last month's killing of four French nationals could strike again, diplomats said on Wednesday.
Saudi authorities officially notified us on Tuesday that the group could attack again and urged foreigners to avoid travelling outside cities, a Western diplomat said.
Interior ministry spokesman Mansour Turki could not provide immediate comment.
Some French residents in Riyadh said they received text messages on Tuesday from their embassy informing them of the Saudi warning.
We have reacted immediately by informing our nationals of the warning which urged foreigners in general to be cautious and to call police as soon as they notice that they are being monitored, French embassy spokesman Alain Guepratte said.
Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday it had arrested some suspects in the killing of the four French nationals and gave 24 hours to two Saudi nationals to turn themselves in.
Abdallah Sayer al-Mohammadi and Nasser bin-Latif al-Balawi have not abided by the ultimatum which expired at 0500 GMT on Wednesday, Mansour Turki said.
The ministry offered 7 million riyals ($1.9 million) for information leading to the arrest of the two men whose pictures were published on front pages of local newspapers.
The four French nationals, including a teenager, were killed on Feb. 26 during a desert trip in the Arab country. 
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. 
Saudi authorities said two attackers perpetrated the killing which was the first attack on foreigners since 2005.
Saudi Arabia has vowed to crack down on Islamic militants and condemned the attack.
Islamic militants swearing allegiance to al Qaeda launched a violent campaign to topple the U.S.-allied Saudi monarchy in 2003, carrying out suicide bomb attacks on foreigners and government installations, including the oil industry.
China's stability could be threatened if the government tried to curb smoking, a senior official said on Wednesday at a discussion of the annual meeting of parliament.
Smoking harms people's health, but restraining smoking threatens social stability, said Zhang Baozhen, deputy chief of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration.
Smokers rioted when the former Soviet Union collapsed because they could not get any cigarettes.
The principle applies in China as well, Zhang said. 
Responding to proposals from some members of China's parliamentary advisory body to curtail the smoking industry.
Partial smoking bans are already in effect in many places around the world, including Hong Kong, which returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, several American states and parts of Europe.
As a developing country, China still needs the tobacco industry, Zhang said.
China, the world's largest producer and consumer of cigarettes, with nearly 2 trillion sticks consumed a year, bans its drivers from smoking, but the law is routinely ignored. 
The World Health Organisation estimates that smoking kills 1.2 million people a year in China.
China's ruling Communist Party has put strong emphasis on maintaining social stability as protests due to corruption, land grabs, environmental disasters and a growing gap between rich and poor increase.
With the development of modern technology, we can reduce the harm of smoking by lowering the toxic ingredients in cigarettes, the official said.
Two Belgian peacekeepers operating as part of a U.N. force in south Lebanon were killed in a vehicle accident on Wednesday, a spokesman for the peacekeeping force said.
Two other Belgian peacekeepers were seriously injured in the accident in the area of Kafr Shuba, in the eastern section of south Lebanon. 
We are investigating, the spokesman said.
Belgian forces are operating as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which was expanded as part of a U.N. Security Council resolution which ended a war between Hezbollah and Israel last year.
UNIFIL has around 12,000 peacekeepers from 28 countries.
At least 12 buildings and two stores were swallowed by a crater in Brazil blamed on massive amounts of rain that fell in January and February, reports said Wednesday.
The disaster site in Monte Alto, about 350 kilometres north-west of Sao Paulo, looked like the destruction from an aerial bomb, according to the internet website Estadao.com.
The hole also swallowed several heavy trucks and construction vehicles that were working nearby.
There were no human injuries because the accident happened during daylight, Estadao said.
Underground earth movements have been identified over the past years in the region, according to Folha Online. 
Mayor Mauricio Piovezan has closed access to another 70 buildings around the crater and ordered the evacuation of more than 200 people to a school.
Panic broke out in the city of 50,000 when the first reports came of the sinkhole. 
The phenomenon of such craters is called vocoroca in Brazil, and occurs frequently in areas with small amounts of vegetation.
Earlier this year, a giant sink hole collapsed over a construction site for an underground  metro station in Sao Paulo and swallowed a minibus, killing at least seven occupants.
A suicide attacker walked into a crowded Iraqi cafe and detonated a bomb, killing 30 people and wounding 29, a police officer in the local command centre told AFP.
The attacker struck in the town of Baladruz northeast of Baghdad, in a district inhabited by members of the area's Shiite Kurd minority, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
State television confirmed there had been an attack.
Unidentified gunmen shot dead an intelligence officer loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Gaza on Friday, a day after rival factions agreed on the make-up of a unity government, medics and residents said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on a car in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah in which Hussein Asserhi was killed and a passenger was wounded.
In a separate incident, gunmen fired at a car carrying a  director of the U.N. refugee relief agency in Gaza City, causing no casualties, officials said.
Palestinians hope the unity deal will end street fighting between Abbas's secular Fatah group and Islamist Hamas that has claimed more than 300 Palestinian lives in the past year.
Abbas and Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas agreed to form a coalition government during Saudi-sponsored talks in Mecca on Feb. 8 after violence sparked fears of civil war.
Disagreement over who would control Palestinian security forces was a major obstacle in coalition talks, but Abbas and Haniyeh agreed to appoint an academic with no security experience to the hotly-contested post of interior minister.
The unity government is also aimed at easing a crippling Western aid embargo of the Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian security sources said United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) operations chief John Ging's armoured car was hit five times by gunfire from a passing vehicle.
There is no information on who did the shooting, an UNRWA official in Gaza told Reuters. 
Palestinian attacks on UNRWA  which supplies vital aid and employment for refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and neighbouring Arab countries have been very rare.
A Frenchman kidnapped February 8 in Nigeria has been freed, diplomatic sources in Paris said Friday.
Gerard Laporal, an expert in logistics who worked for the French petroleum giant Total, was released late Thursday by his captors, members of the Movement for the Emacipation of the Niger Delta. No details about the conditions of his release were provided in Paris.
However, in Nigeria, Rivers State Commissioner of Police Felix Ogbaudu told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa that Laporal was released unconditionally.
It is a happy ending of the abduction saga, and we are happy that the man has regained his freedom, he said.
The kidnapping of foreigners in the Niger Delta has become a major problem. 
Myriad of militant groups in the Niger Delta abduct expatriate workers and damage oil production facilities to back their demands for improved living conditions in the impoverished, but resource-rich region.
Most of the hostages are eventually released after the payment of a ransom. 
Since the beginning of the year some 60 foreigners have been abducted.
Two more US soldiers have died in Iraq, one in a blast in northern Salaheddin province, the military said Friday.
The soldier died of injuries sustained in the explosion during combat operations on Thursday.
A marine died in a non-combat incident in western Anbar province on Thursday, said a separate statement, without elaborating.
The military had on Thursday announced the deaths the same day of four soldiers who died in twin roadside bombings while returning from a cordon and search operation in eastern Baghdad.
The latest deaths brought the US military's losses in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,211, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
Police in the Pakistani capital Islamabad on Friday used tear gas to clear the offices of the private Geo news channel as it broadcast live footage of clashes with protesters.
Windows were smashed in the lobby as officers tried to interrupt transmission of violent scenes near the Supreme Court, where suspended chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry stood before a panel of judges over allegations of misuse of office.
During a visit to the Geo building, Information Minister Mohammed Ali Durrani later condemned the police actions and said the channel should not be prevented from covering the events.
Cameramen on the roof of the television station had a direct view of running battles between police armed with tear gas, rubber bullets and sticks against rock-throwing youths.
The distubances escalated when protesters tried to reach the court while chanting slogans against President Pervez Musharraf.
A suspected Serbian mafia boss was in German custody on Friday, pending his possible extradition to Italy where he is wanted for membership in a criminal organization.
Andrija Draskovic was detained at Frankfurt airport last Sunday on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued in Italy.
Draskovic, who arrived from Belgrade, did not offer any resistance, police said. 
He was unarmed and carried a Bosnian passport as well as a Serbian identity card and driving licenses from both countries and from the US state of California.
Draskovic, 43, is believed to be one of the most powerful figures of the Serbian underworld, with links to the multi-billion dollar international drug smuggling trade.
His influence has grown since the killing of Serbia's then undisputed gangland boss, Zeljko Raznatovic Arkan, for which Draskovic was questioned but never indicted.
He has also been linked to cigarette smuggling between Montenegro and Italy and was questioned about this by an Italian prosecutor from Bari in 2002.
Draskovic is undergoing a re-trial for the 2000 killing of another crime figure in an upmarket Belgrade restaurant. 
He was sentenced twice and spent four years in prison but acquitted on appeal before a mistrial was declared.
A survivor of a spectacular assassination attempt in which his driver was killed, he always travels in a convoy of heavily armoured cars and is surrounded by bodyguards even when he goes to court.
A Frankfurt court is dealing with the extradition request, against which Draskovic has lodged an appeal. 
A court spokesman said a decision would take about four weeks.
At least four people were killed Friday in a bomb attack on Colombia's Pacific coast and another two policemen and five civilians were injured, the governor of the Valle del Cauca province said.
Angelino Garzon described the attack as terrorist, criminal and wicked and said the explosion caused serious damage to nearby buildings in the Colombian port city of Buenaventura.
Authorities suspect that the Marxist rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is behind the attack. 
The port city with 160,000 people plays a large role in the illegal trafficking of drugs and weapons.
South African Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu said on Friday African leaders should feel ashamed for their silence on events in Zimbabwe where the main opposition said police assaulted activists including its leader.
We Africans should hang our heads in shame, Archbishop Tutu said in a written statement. 
How can what is happening in Zimbabwe elicit hardly a word of concern let alone condemnation from us leaders of Africa?
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change says its head Morgan Tsvangirai and scores of party supporters were arrested and beaten in police custody after attempting to stage a prayer rally in Harare in defiance of a ban by President Robert Mugabe's government.
Images of a battered and bruised Tsvangirai going to court have triggered condemnation from former colonial ruler Britain, the United States and other Western countries, but the response from Africa has been largely muted.
After the horrible things done to hapless people in Harare, has come the recent crackdown on members of the opposition.
African Union Chairman John Kufuor has said leaders on the continent should be embarrassed over events in Zimbabwe, and do more to resolve the crisis there.
what more has to happen before we who are leaders, religious and political, of our mother Africa are moved to cry out Enough is enough Tutu said.
Russian security forces have arrested eight people suspected of belonging to a criminal ring that sent women into forced prostitution in Western Europe, Russian media reported on Friday.
The suspects included a Russian army lieutenant-colonel and a Moldovan national, Russian television channels quoted the Federal Security Service as saying. 
The Russian officer could face up to 15 years in jail.
Video footage shown on television featured piles of Russian passports and stamps, as well as photos and European Union visas used by the ring.
With these documents, people were illegally sent to Western Europe where they were treated like slaves, the report said.
Another report said the criminal ring had been helped by a very senior official. 
It said the gang was uncovered in a joint raid involving Interpol and Russian and Uzbek secret services.
Most of those sent to the West were young women forced into prostitution, another report said.
The ex-CIA spy whose unmasking led to the conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney's top aide broke her silence on Friday to accuse the Bush administration of destroying her career for political reasons.
Speaking publicly for the first time, Valerie Plame Wilson told a congressional committee that she felt betrayed when her name appeared in a newspaper column in July 2003, shortly after her husband emerged as an Iraq war critic.
I felt like I had been hit in the gut, Plame said at the hearing, which drew dozens of reporters and photographers and was shown live on cable TV news channels. 
I could no longer do the work which I had been trained to do.
The leak of Plame's identity to reporters prompted an investigation to determine if government officials had broken any laws.
Nobody was charged with blowing her cover, but Lewis Scooter Libby, Cheney's former chief of staff, was found guilty earlier this month of lying and obstructing the investigation.
Evidence at that trial showed Libby and several other White House and State Department officials leaked her identity to discredit her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who had accused the administration of twisting intelligence to build a case for invading Iraq.
The CIA sent Wilson to Niger in 2002 to examine Iraq's nuclear ambitions. 
His 2003 account of that trip put the White House on the defensive over whether it had misled the public about Iraq's nuclear capabilities, a key reason for starting the war.
The narrow focus of the Libby trial left unanswered many questions about the significance of the disclosure of Plame's identity.
Plame made no public statements during the nearly four years of investigation and trial, though the striking blonde did pose for a photo spread in Vanity Fair magazine.
Allies of the Bush administration have stated that it did little damage because she worked a desk job at CIA headquarters.
She used her highly anticipated appearance before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to warn against political interference in the intelligence community and make clear that her identity had been a closely guarded secret.
My exposure arose from purely political motives, Plame said.
Plame (43) told the committee that she held covert status at the time and few people knew she worked at the CIA.
It was not common knowledge on the Georgetown cocktail circuit, she said, referring to the upscale Washington neighborhood.
Plame, who has left the CIA, said the disclosure effectively ended her ability to go on secret missions overseas, as she had done just prior to the leak, and would make it more difficult for the CIA to recruit spies in the future.
My name and identity were carelessly and recklessly abused by senior government officials in the White House and State Department, she said. 
Having signed oaths to protect national security secrets, they should have been diligent in protecting me, and every CIA officer.
Plame also said she was not responsible for sending her husband on the Niger trip, as White House officials had implied.
Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, said Congress would further investigate if White House officials abused classified information.
It's not about Scooter Libby and it's not about Valerie Plame Wilson, Waxman said. 
It's about the integrity of our national security.
Vitamin C from dietary sources, but not from supplements, is associated with a reduced risk of oral pre-malignant lesions in men, a new study indicates.
Dr. Nancy Nairi Maserejian, of New England Research Institutes, Watertown, Massachusetts, and colleagues examined intake of vitamins C, E, A and carotenoids in 42,340 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the occurrence of oral pre-alignant lesions. 
The men provided information on supplement use and diet every 2 to 4 years.
A total of 207 oral premalignant lesions were diagnosed between 1986 and 2002, the team reports in the International Journal of Cancer.
The risk of developing such a lesion was not significantly linked to total intake of vitamin C, vitamin A, or carotenoids. 
However, dietary vitamin C was significantly associated with a reduced risk of oral premalignant lesions: those with the highest intake had a 50 percent reduction in risk compared to those with the lowest intake.
The researchers found no clear relationship with beta-carotene, lycopene, or lutein/zeaxanthin. 
A trend for increased risk of oral pre-malignant lesions was observed with vitamin E, especially among current smokers and with vitamin E supplements. Beta-carotene also increased the risk among current smokers.
It is possible that the protection that seems to be offered by dietary intake of vitamin C is actually partly due to some other component of vitamin C-rich food, Maserejian said in an interview with Reuters Health.
Although we do not yet know exactly what component or interaction between components is most important, a diet that includes vitamin C-rich foods as well as a variety of nutrients is likely to benefit most people, she said.
Our results also highlight the need to consider possible harmful effects of high doses of vitamin E supplements among smokers, the researcher noted.
Britain on Friday asked U.N. officials to brief the Security Council on Zimbabwe's political oppression and economic chaos, but South Africa made clear no action would follow.
Critics of President Robert Mugabe, 83, Zimbabwe's leader since independence from Britain in 1980, accuse him of ruining the country's economy and clamping down on any dissent.
Most recently, Morgan Tsvangirai, head of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, was arrested on Sunday and emerged limping, badly bruised and with a head wound.
He blamed his injuries on an orgy of heavy beatings while in custody.
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry said he asked for a humanitarian briefing because of the attacks on Tsvangirai, the economic crisis and the general political situation.
Jones Parry said he was not asking at this stage for specific action. 
Instead, he said he wanted to focus attention on the events of the last week and the economic and political situation, which had caused Zimbabweans to flee to other countries in southern Africa.
But Dumisani Kumalo, South Africa's U.N. ambassador, said that while he and other council members had no objections to the briefing, the turmoil in Zimbabwe did not affect international peace and security the council's mandate.
We do not believe that the issue of Zimbabwe belongs in the Security Council, Kumalo said. 
So to bring it to the council is surprising.
Developing countries as well as China and Russia have prevented action on Zimbabwe. 
Their main argument is that the council was encroaching on issues such as human rights, which are handled in other forums.
In mid-2005, Britain was successful in organizing a Security Council hearing by Anna Tibaijuka, the head of U.N.-Habitat, who wrote a devastating report on Mugabe's slum demolitions that threw 700,000 people out of their homes or jobs without providing proper housing elsewhere.
President George W. Bush on Friday thanked Saudi King Abdullah and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for participating in a recent conference on Iraq and discussed Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, the White House said.
Bush spoke to King Abdullah about the effort to advance toward a Palestinian state and also peace between Israelis and Palestinians, White House spokesman Tony Snow said.
Bush also spoke with Mubarak about Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's trip to the region next week, Snow said.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan said this week that they will seek a new push on an Arab peace plan with Israel at an Arab League summit later this month in Riyadh.
The U.S. allies are seeking to push a Saudi initiative adopted at a 2002 Arab League summit in Beirut offering Israel normal ties with Arab countries in return for full withdrawal from land it occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
The president made clear once again his commitment to a Palestinian state that can live side by side in peace with Israel, Snow said.
U.S. officials sat down with adversaries from Iran and Syria at a regional conference in Baghdad earlier this month aimed at encouraging neighbors to help in stabilizing Iraq.
At least five people were killed Friday in a bomb attack on Colombia's Pacific coast and another 10 were injured, the governor of the Valle del Cauca province said.
Angelino Garzon described the attack as a terrorist, criminal, savage, inhumane action and said the explosion caused serious damage to nearby buildings in the city of Buenaventura, Colombia's main port.
Authorities suspect that the Marxist rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is behind the attack.
The port city with 160,000 people plays a large role in the illegal trafficking of drugs and weapons.
Government troops and Tiger rebels traded artillery attacks in northern Sri Lanka Saturday as the overnight toll rose to at least six soldiers and a rebel killed, officials said.
Security forces lost five soldiers and 23 were wounded in the district of Vavuniya, while another soldier was killed further north in the Jaffna peninsula, military officials said.
Security forces tried to advance towards Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) positions in the Vavuniya district, but were beaten back by heavy mortar fire from the guerrillas, the Tigers said.
Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said one of their fighters was killed and several others wounded in a three-hour confrontation on Friday.
He said the artillery exchanges were continuing on Saturday but there were no fresh casualties reported.
More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting since December 2005 despite a truce that has been in place, at least on paper, since February 2002.
A payment dispute that delayed construction of Iran's first nuclear reactor could be resolved next week, the Russian firm building the reactor said Friday.
There has been no result in the negotiations so far, but they have lasted so long that we hope they will end next week, Irina Yesipova, a spokeswoman for state-owned company Atomstroiexport, told AFP.
Russia last week accused Iran of withholding payments for the Bushehr reactor, estimated to be worth more than one billion dollars 750 million euros. 
Tehran has rejected the charge.
Negotiators have been working intensively in Tehran and Moscow to resolve the disagreement in order to complete the reactor, which was scheduled to open in September.
International pressure has grown on Iran to suspend its nuclear programme and on Thursday six major global powers agreed to impose fresh sanctions on the Islamic republic for failing to do so.
They accuse it of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon but Iran says it is only building up a civilian nuclear energy programme.
North Korea will not shut down its nuclear facilities until the United States releases all funds frozen in a Macau bank, the communist state's chief nuclear negotiator said Saturday.
If the United States does not remove all of its restriction on our funds at Banco Delta Asia (BDA), we cannot shut down our nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, Kim Kye-gwan told reporters on arrival in Beijing.
Kim's comments were North Korea's first reaction to the US Treasury's announcement on Wednesday that it had cleared the way for the release of about 25 million dollars of North Korean funds frozen in the Macau-based BDA.
In its ruling, the US Treasury barred US banks from dealing with BDA, an institution it said had laundered money for reclusive North Korea.
But the move allowed Macau authorities to decide what to do with the cash after the bank was left in receivership.
Asked if North Korea would stop some of the operations in Yongbyon if only part of the frozen funds were released, Kim said: (In that case) operations  won't stop at all, reported South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
Referring to any future visit to North Korea by the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors, Kim said: The entry by IAEA staff will come only after Yongbyon is shut down. 
Four police officers and two military aircrew were taken to hospital on Sunday after their helicopter crashed in a field in South Armagh, Northern Ireland, police said.
A group of local people threw stones, fireworks and snowballs at the ambulances that ferried the injured men away, as well as other emergency services attending the scene, a spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. 
The Lynx helicopter came down on the outskirts of the town of Crossmaglen, which lies near the border with the Republic of Ireland, just before 6 p.m. (1800 GMT).
The police spokesman said there was no indication the cause of the crash was terrorist related, adding that an investigation would be conducted.
One of the injured police officers was being treated at hospital for a serious back injury, while the three others were discharged after treatment, the spokesman said.
The two soldiers  among a three-man flight crew operating the helicopter  were also being kept in hospital. 
A third soldier escaped the crash unhurt.
Egypt on Sunday slammed Amnesty International condemnation of President Hosni Mubarak's proposed constitutional changes, saying that non-Egyptians had no right to comment on the country's internal matters.
Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit said Amnesty's statement was an attempt to impose foreign oversight on the decision of the Egyptian people.
The human rights body called on Egypt's parliament on Saturday to reject the proposed changes which it described as the most serious undermining of the people's rights in 26 years.
It is not the right of non-Egyptians to comment or simply pass an opinion on a purely internal question, that is, on the constitution (of Egypt) and its national laws, said the minister in a statement received by AFP.
Egypt's parliament on Sunday began debating the changes with around 100 MPs, mainly Islamists, boycotting the session in protest at the attempt to change the constitution.
Nearly 100 Egyptian personalities have already denounced the proposals, accusing Mubarak of laying the groundwork for his son Gamal to succeed to the presidency.
In its criticism, Amnesty said the changes would give sweeping powers of arrest to the police, allow monitoring of private communications and enable Egypt's president to bypass ordinary courts for people suspected of terrorism.
If parliament adopts the changes, the amendments will be put to a referendum on April 4.
North Korean money frozen in a Macau bank will be released into a Chinese bank and turned over to Pyongyang for humanitarian use, a U.S. official said on Monday before nuclear disarmament talks resumed in Beijing.
U.S. Treasury official Daniel Glaser announced the bank moves before six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programme resumed to push forward a Feb. 13 agreement.
The bank dispute had threatened to upset the talks which bring together North and South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia.
As part of the February deal, Washington agreed to resolve within 30 days Pyongyang's complaints about the U.S. crackdown on North Korean funds in Macau's Banco Delta Asia bank, which the United States said were from illicit business.
The United States and North Korean government have reached an understanding on the disposition of DPRK-related funds frozen at Banco Delta Asia, a statement issued by U.S. officials said. 
The statement said that North Korea wanted the $25 million or so frozen in BDA moved into an account at the Bank of China in Beijing.
Glaser said that the money returned to North Korea would be used for benign purposes. 
We have assurances the funds are going to be transferred to a bank in Beijing to be used for humanitarian and educational purposes, Glaser said.
While the Palestinian Authority wants to become more self-sufficient, it will need aid for development for a long time, the incoming Palestinian finance minister said in an interview published on Monday.
Speaking to The Times, Salam Fayyad also said that the biggest challenge for him was cutting the PA's inflated payroll, but noted that there are constraints that meant he would not be able to reduce it quickly.
A key priority is to try to put the finances of the PA on a more sustainable path ... to reduce our need for external assistance, Fayyad was quoted as saying by the daily, just a day after the PA's coalition cabinet met for the first time.
He added, however: We are going to need financial assistance for development needs for a long time.
But as far as financial assistance for current xpenditure is concerned, it is our hope that it will be possible for us to come up with a financial policy consistent with the need to graduate from that kind of exeptional support over the medium term.
Fayyad is the leader of the Third Way bloc, part of the national unity government formed by Hamas and rival party Fatah.
The Hamas-led government has been boycotted by major countries the world over for failing to renounce violence, recognise Israel and accept past peace deals signed by previous Palestinian governments.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Monday he saw signs of hope in Iraq during a weekend visit but that it was too soon to gauge the success of a US troop surge, echoing Washington's view.
The Iraq operation has reached a critical stage and Australia has no intention of pulling its soldiers out of the US-led coalition, Howard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
If the surge can be made to work and if the very cautious signs of hope and optimism can be converted into something stronger, then we could well still see a very good outcome, he said.
Any suggestion that we are going to turn our backs on the Americans, are going to turn our backs on the Iraqis at this very critical stage, would be wrong.
Howard's assessment came two months after President George W. Bush unveiled a last-ditch plan to send 21,500 more combat troops to Iraq to quell spiralling violence in Baghdad and Al-Anbar province, west of the capital.
The Australian prime minister met separately with US commander General David Petraeus and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki during his brief visit on Saturday.
Petraeus expressed optimism about the security crackdown in Baghdad but said there was still a long way to go, Howard said.
General Petraeus has a different approach from his predecessors. 
It is an approach that does involve the population and getting them on side and engaging with them more.
Howard said he was also pleased by his meeting with Maliki.
I am encouraged the prime minister sees his role as that of a national leader and not just as a Shia leader. 
If those beginnings can grow, then we may see some real hope emerging.
It is too early to claim anything other than that there are small, cautiously-based signs of optimism.
Howard is under pressure from the opposition Labor Party to pull Australia's troops out of Iraqi operations, but he signalled that even with an election due by the end of the year he had no intention of withdrawing.
The main focus of the Australians is the training of Iraqi troops in the south of the country, where Howard said they were doing a good job.
I can't begin to understand why the opposition wants to pull out 540 troops who are doing an outstanding job of delivering the very thing we all want that is, a capacity of the Iraqi security forces to fend for themselves.
I want the Australian people to understand that the government remains very committed to its policy.
Sri Lankan troops and Tamil Tiger rebels have fought fierce land battles after government forces said they sunk two ships carrying weapons for the guerrillas, officials said Monday.
An intense battle broke out in the eastern district of Batticaloa Sunday leaving at least two soldiers dead and 13 wounded, military officials said.
The rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said they killed three soldiers and captured the bodies, which were to be returned to military authorities through the Red Cross.
A team of Sri Lankan army troopers tried to advance from Unnichai jungles towards LTTE positions (in Batticaloa), Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said in a statement. 
Following a confrontation, the army troopers retreated leaving behind three dead bodies and several weapons and military materials.
The defence ministry in a statement said troops had caused heavy damages to the Tigers.
In another confrontation in the same district, troops killed four Tiger rebels, a military official said.
The clashes came after the navy said it sank two cargo vessels believed to be smuggling weapons and explosives for Tigers. 
There was no immediate word from the Tamil Tigers about the ships.
The navy carried out a similar attack on February 28 and sank an identical craft off the island's southern coast, according to defence authorities here.
There have been stepped up clashes between suspected Tamil Tiger ships and the Sri Lankan navy in recent months amid heavy fighting in the island's northern and eastern regions.
More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting since December 2005 between government troops and rebels fighting for an independent homeland for the Tamil minority.
The fighting comes despite a truce that has been in place, at least on paper, since February 2002.
Taiwan sees a growing threat from China's diplomatic and military expansion, a point the island's newly named top U.S. diplomat will press when he reaches Washington, D.C., he said on Monday.
To resist China, Taiwan hopes to raise its profile in U.S. diplomatic circles, Joseph Wu told Reuters in his first formal interview since being named on Sunday as the new de facto Taiwan ambassador to the United States.
Wu also said he would not rule out meeting with senior U.S. officials or the Chinese ambassador. 
He pointed to China's recent military build-up as one of the biggest threats that Taiwan faces.
This is a danger to Taiwan, and the trend we see is that this danger is getting bigger and bigger. 
Also on the diplomacy front, China's foreign relations power is getting stronger and stronger, he said.
Only 18 percent of Iraqis have confidence in U.S.-led forces and about 86 percent are concerned about someone in their household being a victim of violence, according to a survey published by the BBC on Monday.
The poll of more than 2,000 people indicated Iraqis have become less optimistic about their future compared to a similar survey in 2005 when respondents were generally hopeful, the BBC said.
The Iraqi government inspired more confidence than U.S.-led forces, with opinion almost evenly split on whether people had confidence in the U.S.-backed administration headed by Shi'ite Islamist Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
Iraqis were also disappointed by reconstruction efforts in the four years since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein, with 67 percent saying efforts had not been effective.
Most Israelis (56 percent) want their country to have at least partial contacts with the new Palestinian unity government of Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, a poll published Monday indicated. 
Some 39 per cent said Israel should talk to the unity government as a whole, while another 17 per cent said the Jewish state should at least talk to the Fatah members of the government while continuing to boycott its Hamas officials.
The poll, commissioned by the Yediot Ahronot daily, questioned 517 adult Israelis Sunday and had a margin of error of 4.3 per cent.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's cabinet decided Sunday to boycott the new government, sworn in Saturday, for its failure to recognize Israel's right to exist and renounce violence as a legitimate means to achieve Palestinian statehood.
The cabinet voted to have separate contacts only with moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah party has joined the Islamic militant Hamas in the unity cabinet after a months-long power struggle.
Hong Kong authorities are struggling to replace 1,000-dollar notes issued by banking giant HSBC in 2000 and 2002 after finding more than 700,000 dollars (900,000 US) in high-quality fakes.
More than 700 1,000-dollar notes purportedly issued by HSBC were found in the banking system last week, and 12 people from Hong Kong, China and Vietnam have been arrested in connection with the case.
Joseph Yam, the head of Hong Kong Monetary Authority, called on people to return all notes of that denomination issued by HSBC for those two years.
It was not clear exactly how many of them have circulated in the city, but Yam said he believed the number was limited.
The discovery has caused panic in the southern Chinese territory, and many shops are now rejecting such notes.
Police chief Tang King-shing said the bogus notes originated from outside Hong Kong and that police were working with law enforcement agencies overseas to smash the syndicate.
New Zealand police arrested two skinheads on Monday and charged them with a white supremacist attack on four Asian students in the South Island city of Nelson.
Reports said a 15-year-old boy had been taken to hospital with a suspected broken jaw after being kicked in the face during the unprovoked attack on Saturday.
Police said the Nelson College students were sitting outside a shop when a car stopped and they were attacked by the skinheads who hurled racist taunts at them.
The Nelson Evening Mail reported that the victims managed to run away but noted the car's registration plate.
Police later arrested two men aged 28 and 20, charging them with assault. 
Always call an emergency service instead of hunting down the phone number of a victim's general practitioner if you suspect a stroke.
Stroke victims need treatment as soon as possible, preferably in a clinic with a stroke unit, Uwe Meier, chairman of the Grevenbroich-based Professional Association of German Neurologists told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa in an interview.
The time wasted just keeps the patient from getting the proper care.
The sooner treatment starts, the better it is for the patient, said Meier. 
Doctors often say time is brain. 
In other words, the more time that passes before treatment, the greater the risk of irreparable brain damage.
A stroke is an acute blockage of blood flow, usually caused by a blood clot. 
The blockage prevents oxygen from reaching parts of the brain, which can disrupt bodily functions. 
Unless the clot is broken up quickly with medicine, parts of the brain can suffer cellular death.
Meier says strokes are the third most common cause of death in Germany and the main cause of serious handicaps. 
Contrary to popular belief, not only the elderly are at risk of strokes.
A stroke can come at any age, says Meier. 
It can affect an 80-year-old as easily as an infant.
The causes of a stroke varies by age group. 
Older people's blood vessels are more likely to be constricted by problems like arteriosclerosis. 
Younger people are more likely to fall victim to clots blocking their blood vessels, diseases that cause blood vessels to tear or vascular infections. 
Heart failure is also a common cause because it can create clots in the heart that might be pumped to the brain. 
Smoking, high blood pressure, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are all risk factors increasing the odds of stroke.
Meier says the biggest problem for patients is recognizing a stroke in time. 
Strokes  do not usually involve pain. 
If someone suffers an acute chest pain associated with a heart attack, they call the ambulance immediately. 
Deafness, dizziness, vision problems and unconscious spells also indicate a stroke and it's hard to gauge the danger. 
Meier says a small precursor stroke can quickly be followed by a major stroke, which makes it all the more important to call an ambulance immediately.
After four years of intensive collaboration, 18 top mathematicians and computer scientists from the United States and Europe have successfully mapped E8, one of the largest and most complicated structures in mathematics, scientists said late Sunday.
Jeffrey Adams, project leader and mathematics professor at the University of Maryland said E8 was discovered over a century ago, in 1887, and until now, no one thought the structure could ever be understood.
This groundbreaking achievement is significant both as an advance in basic knowledge, as well as a major advance in the use of large scale computing to solve complicated mathematical problems, Adams said. 
He added that the mapping of E8 may well have unforeseen implications in mathematics and physics which won't be evident for years to come.
E8 belongs to so-called Lie groups that were invented by a 19th century Norwegian mathematician, Sophus Lie, to study symmetry. 
The theory holds that underlying any symmetrical object, such as a sphere, is a Lie group. 
Balls, cylinders or cones are familiar examples of symmetric three-dimensional objects.
However, mathematicians study symmetries in higher dimensions. In fact, E8  itself is 248-dimensional.
The scientists said the magnitude of the E8 calculation invited comparison with the Human Genome Project. 
While the human genome, which contains all the genetic information of a cell, is less than a gigabyte in size, the result of the E8 calculation, which contains all the information about E8, is 60 gigabytes in size, they said. 
This is enough to store 45 days of continuous music in MP3-format. 
If written out on paper, the answer would cover an area the size of Manhattan.
A U.S. embassy convoy was hit by a Taliban suicide car bomber in Kabul on Monday, killing an Afghan teenager by the road and wounding officials in the motorcade, police and an embassy spokesman said.
A 14-year-old boy was killed in the attack, which took place on a main road leading east out of the Afghan capital which is often used by NATO and U.S.-led coalition troops, police said.
Several embassy officials and pedestrians were wounded, U.S. embassy spokesman Joe Mellott said, adding that the injuries of some officials were serious.
U.S. Ambassador Ronald Neumann was not in the convoy. 
Western troops had sealed off the site of the attack, one police officer told Reuters from the scene, and a helicopter hovered above.
A Reuters photographer saw, from a distance, smoke rising from a car at the scene.
Mullah Dadullah, a senior Taliban commander, claimed responsibility for the attack and said several U.S. soldiers had been killed in the blast.
The rebels planned more attacks, he told Reuters by satellite phone from a secret location.
The attack comes amid an increase in Taliban raids, including suicide attacks, in recent weeks as fighting picks up after a relative winter lull.
NATO launched an offensive in southern Afghanistan this month to try to pre-empt a spring offensive by the rebels.
The United States has approved a visa for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to enable him to address the U.N. Security Council over Tehran's nuclear program, the State Department said on Monday
We received the applications and have processed them, said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. 
Asked if that meant the visa had been approved, he said, Yes.
The United States is at loggerheads with Iran over its nuclear program and Ahmadinejad wants to address the Security Council in New York before it votes on a resolution imposing new arms and financial sanctions against Tehran.
A draft resolution introduced to the council last week would ban all Iranian arms exports, but not imports, and freeze financial assets abroad of 28 individuals, groups and companies.
The measure also requires Iran to halt uranium enrichment and the processing of nuclear fuel within 60 days after passage or face the possibility of additional sanctions.
Tehran argues that its nuclear plans are for peaceful power generation purposes while the United States and others say the main object of the program is to build a nuclear bomb.
McCormack said he hoped the Iranian president would use his time at the United Nations to seek dialogue rather than confrontation with the West.
He urged Ahmadinejad to accept an offer by the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council, as well as Germany, to give up uranium enrichment and start negotiations with them over its nuclear program.
This could be an important moment to accept that offer, said McCormack.
Twelve candidates are to run in next month's French presidential election after gathering the 500 endorsements needed to qualify, France's Constitutional Court announced Monday.
The 12 include right-wing favourite Nicolas Sarkozy, Socialist Segolene Royal and centrist Francois Bayrou, as well as anti-globalisation crusader Jose Bove, who was uncertain of qualifying for the April 22 first round.
Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had accused political rivals of pressuring mayors to withhold their sponsorships, also qualified for the race, according to the council's president Jean-Louis Debre.
On the left the other candidates are postman Olivier Besancenot of the Revolutionary Communist League, Workers' Struggle candidate Arlette Laguiller, Communist Party Marie-George Buffet, small-town mayor Gerard Schivardi and the Green Party candidate Dominique Voynet.
On the right, the fourth challenger is the nationalist Philippe de Villiers of the Movement for France, while Frederic Nihous of the Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions party is standing on a single-issue ticket.
The overall number is lower than in 2002, when 16 candidates contested the first round, seen as one of the reasons for Le Pen's shock presence in the second round run-off. The line-up also includes four women, the highest share in any French presidential election.
Under rules designed to weed out frivolous candidacies, would-be contenders had until Friday to submit 500 endorsements from mayors and other elected officials to the Constitutional Council, the body that supervises the election.
The council worked through the weekend to establish the validity of the sponsorships.
Bove, who became a household name after he attacked a McDonald's outlet in southern France in 1999 to protest la malbouffe or bad food, had scraped in with 504 sponsorship forms but was unsure whether all would be considered valid.
Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo was freed Monday in exchange for five Taliban prisoners, an Afghan news agency reported citing an audiotape message from a rebel commander.
Pajhwok Afghan News said it had been sent a recorded message from Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah confirming the release and naming the five prisoners he was exchanged for.
Two were head of the Taliban cultural wing, Ustad Yasar and ex-spokesman Latifullah Hakimi, both arrested in 2005.
The others were Mansoor Ahmad, a brother of Dadullah, and two commanders named Hamdullah and Abdul Ghaffar. There were no details on these men.
Dadullah said he had demanded the release of another Taliban spokesman, Mohammad Hanif, captured in October last year, but Mansoor Ahmad was handed over instead.
Dadullah said in the tape that he was still holding Mastrogiacomo's Afghan interpreter.
AFP could not independently confirm the terms of the release.
However, presidential spokesman Karim Rahimi told AFP that President Hamid Karzai had ordered the security organisations to make all possible efforts to gain his release.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's embattled government on Monday summoned and threatened to expel Western ambassadors it accuses of backing an opposition drive to oust Mugabe from power.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi told Zimbabwe state television ZTV that he had warned envoys accredited to Harare that Mugabe's government would not hesitate to boot out those who support opposition politics.
I summoned the ambassadors, and I told them that Zimbabwe will not allow any interferance in its internal affairs and that those who are going to continue funding and supporting this programme to (remove the government from power) will be expelled, he said during a ZTV news bulletin in the local Shona language.
Iraq on Tuesday marked the fourth anniversary of the US-led invasion with signs of growing bitterness against American troops and a new act of recrimination against Saddam Hussein's regime.
In the four years since the launch of the shock and awe military campaign just before dawn on March 20, 2003, Iraq has descended into a sectarian hell that has left tens of thousands of civilians dead.
At 5:35 am on that day, Tomahawk missiles and precision-guided bombs rained down on Baghdad targets as Saddam vowed that this would be Iraq's last battle against the tyrannous villains.
On April 9, the Iraqi strongman's statue in a central square was torn down with a rope around the neck, in a premonition of his own hanging last December 30, after his convictionn for crimes against humanity.
His vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, was to follow him to the gallows on on Tuesday's anniversary, a lawyer from Saddam's defence team said.
US President George W. Bush, facing growing anti-war protests, pleaded for patience on Monday with his unpopular Iraq strategy and Washington's revamped efforts to restore order.
The Baghdad security plan is still in its early stages and success will take months, not days or weeks, the embattled president said.
It could be tempting to look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude our best option is to pack up and go home. 
That may be satisfying in the short run, but I believe the consequences for American security would be devastating.
Despite Bush's warnings, a new poll showed US public opinion on Iraq had soured further, with just 32 percent of Americans saying they favoured the war, compared to 72 percent on the eve of conflict four years ago.
And despite recent claims by the Bush administration that the month-old US troop surge in Baghdad was beginning to work, another poll by Western media organisations told a story of Iraqi pessimism.
Only 18 percent of Iraqis had confidence in US and coalition troops, while 78 percent opposed their presence, 69 percent said their presence made security worse and 51 percent said attacks on coalition forces were justified.
Protests have been staged across the United States and in several European cities and Japan, against the war that was originally based on a premise of eliminating weapons of mass destruction that were never found.
Commanders are now pouring 25,000 reinforcements into Baghdad to quell Sunni-Shiite fighting, the bloodiest element of the conflict and one which even the Pentagon admits amounts to civil war.
In western and northern Iraq, Al-Qaeda militants pursue their brutal insurgency against the US-backed government, while in the south and centre Shiite militias jostle for supremacy and control of oil resources.
The launch of the joint US-Iraqi security plan in Baghdad has driven some sectarian death squads from the streets, but car bombs still explode every day, scattering bodies and bloodied debris through crowded markets.
There has been a steady decline in the Iraq situation since the invasion. 
Things have gone from bad to worse, said Joost Hiltermann, Middle East project director for the International Crisis Group, a respected think tank.
The raw figures do not tell the whole story of a complex crisis, but they make grim reading.
Since the conflict began, two million Iraqis have fled the country and 1.8 million have been displaced within its borders, according to figures compiled by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Estimates of Iraqi civilian casualties in the past four years vary wildly, but the Iraq Body Count website's figure of 58,800 is among the more conservative. 
The Baghdad government said 1,440 people were killed in January alone.
At least 3,203 American, 132 British and 124 other coalition soldiers have also died since the invasion.
The government of Guinea-Bissau lost a vote of confidence on Monday and now has three days to hand over power to a coalition government.
Lawmakers voted 54 to 28 against Prime Minister Aristide Gomes' administration, with eight deputies abstaining and ten others absent.
The vote followed a decision by the three biggest political parties, who between them hold 97 of the 100 seats in the national assembly, to push for a new government of consensus in the interests of parliamentary stability.
Under the terms of the Guinea-Bissau constitution, President Joao Bernardo Vieira must now dissolve the government within 72 hours.
The government does not have legitimacy starting today, said Joao Sediba Sani, the parliamentary leader of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC), following the vote.
However, the secretary to the national assembly, Armando Procel, complained of irregularities during the vote motion and vowed the government would appeal the decision in the Supreme Court.   
Gomes was appointed prime minister in November 2005 over the objections of the PAIGC. 
He replaced Carlos Gomes Junior, who was sacked following a series of disputes with President Vieira.
Vieira was overthrown from power in 1999 after 19 years of iron-fisted rule, but controversially returned from exile in Portugal to run for the presidency as an independent in 2005.
However, since then he has had problems getting support in parliament, in a power struggle that has weakened the impoverished west African country.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates pledged Monday to open Internet community centers in Colombia where demobilized rebel and paramilitary fighters can take correspondence courses.
Gates, speaking to reporters in the Caribbean coast city of Cartagena after meeting with President Alvaro Uribe, said Microsoft would help the violence-torn country's peace efforts through training that aims to re-integrate former fighters into civil society.
Asked how Microsoft would contribute, Gates said: Some of these community centers are being put in those areas (where demobilized fighters live).
Gates, however, said he would be unable to visit the areas.
(The Colombian government) wanted me to go to those locations. 
Unfortunately my schedule didn't offer the opportunity to go to any of these locations, he said.
Gates met earlier with Uribe and cabinet members in the Guests' House of the colonial city's Manzanillo Fort.
At the meeting, Gates agreed with the Education Ministry to provide 15,000 new Windows operating systems for schools, universities and libraries.
Colombia has fought leftist guerrillas since the 1960s, while right-wing paramilitaries formed in the 1980s to fight against the rebels.
The paramilitary group United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) officially demobilized the last of its 30,000 fighters last year as part of an agreement with Bogota in which its leaders will serve prison terms of no more than eight years.
While the government has started talks with the 4,500-strong National Liberation Army (ELN) aimed at starting peace negotiations, Bogota remains at loggerheads with the 14,000-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
For US troops from 9th Cavalry Regiment bumping around the dangerous streets of Baghdad in Humvees after dark on Monday, news that their deployment in Iraq could be extended fell like a hammer blow.
Their commanders had cautioned that their second one-year tour due to end in October could be prolonged while US President George W. Bush later warned troops it was too soon to pack up and go home.
The expletives during the four-hour night patrol turned the air in the Humvee, already thick with cigarette smoke, a dark shade of blue.
We just want to get out of here as soon as possible, said one vehicle commander in one of his few printable comments.
It's because the Iraqi army is so scared that we have to come here to die. 
He added, asking not to be named.
Ninety-five percent of Iraqis are good but five percent are bad. 
But the 95 percent are too weak to stand up to the five percent.
Bush should send all the Death Row prisoners here and they can be killed fighting the terrorists. 
We've had enough, said another soldier, as the Humvee accelerated past a roadside car in case it exploded.
Added yet another, Bush can come fight here. 
He can take my 1,000 dollars a month and I'll go home.
Commander of the night operation, Lieutenant Brian Long, said the anger was understandable.
One of the men has five children, another has three. 
Another has a boy aged four  he's missed two of those years. 
He'll never get them back, said Long.
It is like the movie 'Groundhog Day'. 
Each day is the same and nothing ever changes, he added.
Referring to the 1993 movie in which the principal character is doomed to repeat the same day endlessly.
Everyone just wants to get home to their families, said the officer.
Bush, after speaking to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and the top US military commander in Iraq, said in Washington that his new plan to pacify  war-wracked Iraq would take months.
It could be tempting to look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude our best option is to pack up and go home, Bush said, four years to the day after he announced that American troops were fighting to depose Saddam Hussein.
That may be satisfying in the short run, but I believe the consequences for American security would be devastating, Bush said.
Platoon commander of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, Captain Christopher Dawson, said he understood the need for troops to stay in Iraq.
We are starting to make a difference, he said. 
The violence is dropping. 
We are training Iraqis to take over responsibility for their own security. 
We are helping them see their future ahead of them. 
It is in their hands.
But the lower ranks were in rebellious mood, especially after publication of a poll on Monday, commissioned by the BBC, ABC News, ARD German TV and USA Today, which showed only 18 percent of those questioned had confidence in US and coalition troops, while 78 percent opposed their presence.
If no one wants us here we are quite ready to get out tomorrow, said the outspoken vehicle commander.
One of the few Iraqis the troops met during their night patrol  most stay indoors once the 8pm curfew kicks in  said he feared the day the US forces pulled out.
They can stay for 100 years if they want, said Salam Ahmed, a security guard at a shoe warehouse on the outskirts of the city. 
If they go, the bad guys will certainly come for me.
Police arrested more than 100 Iraq war protesters in San Francisco and New York City on Monday as the nation marked the fourth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
Uniformed police outnumbered the fewer than 100 protesters outside the stock exchange building at the corner of Broad and Wall streets in New York's historic financial district.
Stop the money, stop the war, demonstrators chanted as police hauled away limp-bodied protesters.
A police spokesman said 44 were arrested.
Demonstrators said they were directing their protest at major defense contractors Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Halliburton, General Electric and others. 
The protest had no impact on the stock exchange's trading.
U.S. service members and Iraqi civilians are dying so that an elite few can profit, said Fabian Bouthillette (26), a high school teacher who served for two years in the U.S. Navy.
In San Francisco, dozens of demonstrators, many of them old enough to have once protested the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s, conducted a Die In by lying on the sidewalk and pretending to be dead. 
Some wore fake blood to recall the more than 3,200 U.S. military personnel killed in the Iraq War.
Many later moved to obstruct Market Street, running through the city's central business district.
As soon as they went out there we started making arrests, police spokesman Neville Gittens said. 
They were warned.
Another spokesman said police arrested 57 people in two separate San Francisco locations.
Polls show most Americans now oppose the war in Iraq, yet without a military draft like that which helped focus public opposition to the Vietnam War, public protests have been far smaller than they were in that era.
Thousands have, however, rallied against the war in recent days nationwide, including in the Washington D.C. area, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
A panel of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Tuesday approved the planned dispatch of Self-Defense Forces personnel to Nepal to participate in a U.N. military observer mission, under the law to cooperate with the United Nations peacekeeping operations, party members said.
The plan to be submitted for approval to the LDP's policy commission and general council, will be formally adopted by the government at a Cabinet meeting March 27. 
Making way for the first SDF deployment overseas since the Defense Agency was upgraded to the Defense Ministry in January, according to government sources.
Under the plan, six unarmed Ground Self-Defense Force members will be sent to Nepal from April 1 and stay there until March 31 next year to take part in the activities of the U.N. Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN).
UNMIN was established Jan. 23 by the U.N. Security Council after the Nepalese government and the Maoist rebels of the Communist Party of Nepal declared an end to their conflict by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement last November.
One of every 250 childbirths involves a threat to the mother's life in Japan, according to a health ministry research team's study released Tuesday.
The group studied some 125,000 childbirths in 2004, or 11 percent of the overall deliveries nationwide in the year, at 333 institutions.
Of them, 32 mothers died of massive bleeding or other causes. 
The researchers said they found some 2,300 mothers faced life-threatening situations during delivery a figure 70 times higher than the number of actual deaths.
Based on the data, the group at the Ministry of Health, Labor and welfare projected some 4,500 mothers faced life-threatening situations, or one of every 250 deliveries, in 2005, when 62 mothers died delivering children.
While the deaths of mothers remained at 4 to 7 per 100,000 deliveries between 2000 and 2005 in Japan, a group member noted the actual risk from pregnancy and delivery is higher than projected.
North Korea accused Tokyo of trying to scuttle nuclear disarmament talks and said it does not want energy aid from Japan as a part of a deal to end Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme, its media reported on Tuesday.
Japan has said it will not give full-scale economic aid to North Korea or establish diplomatic ties unless a feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang in the 1970s and 1980s to train its spies has been resolved.
The DPRK (North Korea) does not care about whether Japan gives energy assistance to it or not because it would not affect much the DPRK's economic development, the North's official KCNA news agency said.
North Korea repeated its claim that the abduction issue had been solved and called on Japan to pay compensation and apologise for its brutal 1910-1945 rule over the Korean peninsula and forcing Korean women to be sex slaves for Japan's troops.
The DPRK strongly demands Japan stop talking about the 'abduction issue' but redeem the crimes committed by it in the past which are more horrendous than the issue and sincerely implement the agreement reached at the six-party talks, it said.
It said the breakdown of the bilateral talks last month was due to: The right-wing forces of Japan who do not want the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and the normalisation of the bilateral relations.
About two weeks ago, Japan and North Korea cut short talks on formally setting up diplomatic ties after wrangling over historical differences.
Impoverished North Korea, which depends heavily on handouts from China and South Korea to feed its people and power its anaemic economy, has wanted Japan ousted from six-way nuclear talks among the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States.
North Korea admitted in 2002 that its agents had abducted 13 Japanese. 
Five were repatriated. 
Japan has demanded the return of any survivors, but Pyongyang said the other eight are dead.
The latest round of the nuclear talks opened on Monday in Beijing. 
At the last round in February, North Korea agreed to begin shutting down its main reactor and source of weapons-grade plutonium for energy aid.
A car bomb exploded in an automobile spare parts market in Baghdad on Tuesday, killing one person and wounding six, a medic said.
As Iraq marked the fourth anniversary of the US-led invasion.
The explosion occurred at 7:20 am  in Mujamma al-Misham market in south Baghdad, well known for selling tyres, batteries and other spare parts.
Insurgents have managed to carry out car bombings in Baghdad despite a massive security crackdown in the capital since February.
About 90,000 US and Iraqi troops are patrolling the streets of Baghdad to curb insurgent and sectarian violence.
Three suspected Islamic militants and an Indian army officer were killed Tuesday during a gunbattle in the north of Indian-administered Kashmir, police said.
The fighting erupted late Monday when counter-insurgency police and army troops raided a hide-out in Kupwara district, a police spokesman said.
He said in the initial burst of firing by the militants an army captain and a soldier were hurt.
The injured captain later died in a hospital, the spokesman said, adding three rebels were killed in the ensuing gunbattle.
Violence has dipped in Kashmir since India and Pakistan which hold the region in parts but claim it in full started a peace process in January 2004.
The daily death toll has dropped from 10 in 2001 to three in 2006.
The unrest has claimed nearly 44,000 lives since militants launched their insurgency against Indian rule in 1989.
A Swiss man was sentenced to 10 years in jail Thursday after pleading guilty to publicly defacing portraits of Thailand's revered king in December.
The court ordered a 20-year sentence for Oliver Rudolf Jufer, 57, but reduced it by half because he cooperated and pleaded of guilty to five counts of lese majeste in a closed-door hearing.
Jufer was arrested in Chiang Mai, 560 kilometres north of Bangkok, on December 5 after closed-circuit cameras recorded him drunkenly spray-painting portraits of King Bhumibol Adulyadej on the monarch's 79th birthday.
The king, who celebrated his 60th year on the throne last year, is highly revered by Thai people on his own merits, but is also protected against criticism and insults under the country's lese majeste law.
The law makes it a crime to insult or belittle the monarchy, including the king and the entire royal family.
Judge Phissanu Tanbuaklee said Jufer would have been jailed for 20 years if he had not pleaded guilty. 
He also noted that Jufer had lived in Chiang Mai for a decade and was well aware of the law and the people's respect for the king.
Thais are especially sensitive about King Bhumibol's place in the constitutional monarchy because the country is going through a period of acute political turbulence.
The former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by a military coup in September, is accused by his opponents of attempting to encroach on the king's prerogatives.
Lese majeste carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, but Jufer faced five charges and could have been sentenced to up to 75 years in jail. 
The judge gave him four years on each count, and then reduced the total by half.
At least 15 Iraqis were killed and over 20 wounded Thursday in a series of blasts across the Iraqi capital Baghdad, sources said.
In southern Baghdad, at least two Iraqis were killed and 10 others wounded Thursday in a car bomb blast in Bayaa district, the Voices of Iraq news agency reported, citing an Iraqi police source.
In other news, at least three Iraqis were killed and 10 injured Thursday when a car bomb exploded near a gas station in the Amel district of south-western Baghdad, Voices of Iraq reported.
Also Thursday, at least 10 Iraqis were killed and an unconfirmed number wounded in a car bomb blast near a mosque in Mahmudiya, some 30 kilometres from the capital, witnesses said.
In Mosul, a senior leader of the al-Qaeda terrorist network in Iraq was captured by Iraqi army forces in Mosul, Voices of Iraq reported Thursday citing a well-informed source in Ninewa province.
Abdul Karim al-Baz, known under the alias Abu al-Hareth, was arrested in a house in Nahrawan neighbourhood, south west of Mosul, 400 kilometres north of Baghdad, the source added.
Meanwhile, US-led coalition forces killed four terrorist suspects and detained 15 others during operations Thursday, the US military reported.
During an operation in Baghdad, coalition forces arrested nine suspected terrorists allegedly involved with the al-Qaeda network.
Suspects were also arrested near Haditha, 220 kilometres north-west of Baghdad, and Fallujah, 50 kilometres west of the Iraqi capital.
The Iranian consulate in Iraq's southern city of Basra accused British forces of storming and surrounding its office during a shootout with gunmen on Thursday.
The British military flatly denied any such incident, saying its soldiers had come under small arms fire during a routine patrol in the vicinity of the Iranian consulate but did not leave their vehicles.
The incident came amid a diplomatic standoff between Tehran and London over Iran's seizure of 15 British sailors and marines in Gulf waters last Friday.
British forces sealed off the Iranian consulate in Basra. 
They went inside for 10 minutes and after that there was intense gunfire on them, Iranian consul Mohammed Reva Nasir told AFP in Basra.
This is a provocative act against the Iranian consulate in Basra. 
I believe it has something to do with the British detainees in Iran, he said.
Asked whether British troops raided the consulate, spokesman Major David Gell told AFP: No. Absolutely not.
There was a vehicle patrol going back into Basra Palace (a British base in Basra). 
The rear vehicle received small arms fire. 
We returned fire in self defence and the patrol continued on, Gell said.
I'm led to believe (the incident happened) in the same street as the Iranian consulate, he added.
There is absolutely no link to the building. 
It's pure coincidence that it took place in that area, Gell said.
No troops were injured and none of them got out of the vehicle.
The Iranian foreign ministry protested what it called the British forces' provocative act, according to a statement obtained by AFP.
The Iranian consulate operates with the consent of Iraqi authorities and its personnel enjoy diplomatic immunity.
Iran has protested to the Iraqi authorities, who are responsible for the safety of consular personnel under international law, the ministry said.
African leaders named South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki on Thursday to facilitate dialogue between Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and his political opponents to resolve the country's deepening crisis.
A special summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) also called on the West to drop sanctions against Mugabe's government and appealed to Britain to honour its commitments to fund land reforms in its former colony.
The extraordinary summit mandated his excellency President Thabo Mbeki to continue to facilitate dialogue between opposition and government and report back on progress, a statement at the end of the two-day summit said.
Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, who hosted the summit amid growing Western calls for a tough line on Mugabe's most recent political crackdown, said the regional grouping appealed to all sides in the dispute to step back from the brink.
Of course the appeal to parties is to be cooperative and give this initiative a chance, also for the parties to exercise restraint and avoid anything that's going to inflame the situation, he told reporters at a news conference.
The summit, attended by both Mugabe and Mbeki, satisfied longterm demands of Zimbabwe's government by calling on all sanctions against the country to be lifted.
The United States and the European Union have imposed targeted sanctions on Mugabe and his circle following a series of elections that the opposition says were rigged.
The southern African leaders also echoed Mugabe's frequent demand that London be held to vague commitments it made to assist with financing land reforms in Zimbabwe after it achieved independence in 1980.
The extraordinary summit reiterated its appeal to Britain to honour its compensation obligations with regard to land reforms, the summit statement said.
Mugabe has repeatedly accused Britain of reneging on its promises and, in 2000, launched his own drive to forcibly seize white-owned farms to give to landless blacks launching the country on an economic and political downward spiral.
Ivory Coast's President Laurent Gbagbo on Thursday appointed rebel leader Guillaume Soro as prime minister, a presidential spokesman said.
Gbagbo and Soro, leader of the New Forces rebels who seized control of the north of Ivory Coast after a brief 2002-2003 civil war, signed a peace deal three weeks ago to reunite the West African country.
The home-grown deal, which came after a series of foreign brokered deals had foundered in the world's largest cocoa producer, envisaged a transitional government by April 8 and elections within 10 months.
The president decrees the appointment of Guillaume Soro as prime minister and head of government, said presidential spokesman Desire Tagro.
Gbagbo was meeting with Soro on Thursday at the presidential palace and the two were due to hold a news conference afterwards.
The latest peace accord has already led to the creation of a joint army command to focus on demobilising militia fighters. 
It foresees the dismantling of a U.N.-manned buffer zone between the two warring factions.
The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday welcomed the latest agreement and said it would back the peace process.
Two NATO-led soldiers died in a traffic accident in Afghanistan on Wednesday, and a rocket also hit the biggest US military base in the country, officials said on Thursday.
The soldiers died from injuries sustained during a road traffic accident, International Security Assistance Force said in a statement.
There was no hostile fire involved in the incident, the statement said.
In another incident, a rocket hit in Bagram airport the biggest US military base north of Kabul city on Wednesday, causing no casualties or damage, the US military said in a statement. 
It said the rocket hit an unoccupied area near the runway.
The Wednesday attack came a month after a suicide bombing that took place during the visit of US Vice President Dick Cheney in Feb 27. 
That attack left at least 18 people killed and several others were wounded.
Sri Lankan war planes bombed suspected Tamil Tiger positions Friday after the rebels blew up five soldiers and allegedly killed eight civilians in shelling, officials said.
Supersonic jets bombed rebel-held territory after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) set off a road side bomb and ambushed a military vehicle, killing five soldiers and wounding another, the military said.
We have hit three LTTE targets today, a spokesman for the Sri Lankan airforce said. 
He said there were no details on casualties.
The military also reported eight civilians were killed in shelling in the east of the island, where the two sides have been locked in long-range attacks.
The defence ministry said the civilians were killed as a result of firing by Tamil Tiger rebels into populated areas of Batticaloa district. 
There was no immediate comment from the Tigers.
There has been heavy fighting between the two sides in the coastal Batticaloa region, where the military captured a Tiger base on Wednesday.
The Tiger rebels are leading a drawn out campaign for independence. 
More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest wave of fighting since December 2005 despite a truce arranged by peace broker Norway in 2002.
Taliban militants Friday freed the principal of a high school who was kidnapped four days ago for stopping the rebels recruiting his students, his family said.
Farid Mehsud, principal of the Oxford Public School in Tank, which borders the restive South Waziristan tribal region, and his brother Humayun were abducted by about a dozen gunmen from his house on Tuesday.
The previous day a militant leader and a policeman were killed in a clash outside the school after police called by Mehsud prevented the Taliban entering to recruit young men to fight in Afghanistan.
I have received a telephone call from a tribal jirga (council of elders) that both of them have been released, their brother Khurshid told reporters in Tank.
The release was negotiated by an eight-member council led by a local cleric, he said.
A council member told him that Farid and Humayun had been handed over to the jirga and they would reach Tank late Friday, Khurshid said but gave no further details.
Tank, which adjoins the troubled tribal region of South Waziristan, remained under curfew for a third day Friday due to a round of violence sparked by the incident at the school.
Officials reported no further clashes there Friday.
Analysts said the incident at the school was further proof of the increasing Talibanisation of parts of Pakistan.
The Iranian government has asked Britain to guarantee that violations of its territorial waters in the Gulf are not repeated, a note sent to the British embassy in Tehran said.
The text of the communication, believed to be the first contact between Iran and Britain's embassy in Tehran in the present crisis, was published by the Iranian embassy in London Friday.
It repeats the Iranian position that two British patrol boats trespassed on Iran's territorial waters when the 15 sailors and royal marines were captured last Friday.
The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran protests strongly against this illegal act in violating Iranian territorial waters, said the note.
It underlined the responsibility of the British government for the consequences of such violation, and calls for the guarantee to avoid the recurrence of such acts.
Earlier, the Foreign Office in London said it would give serious consideration to the note.
Analysts in London pointed out that the Iranian communication did not include a request for a formal apology over the incident from the British government.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said Friday that he had acknowledged to his fellow African leaders that opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai had been assaulted, but said he deserved it.
Yes, I told them he was beaten but he asked for it, Mugabe told supporters the day after returning from a regional summit in Tanzania.
We got full backing, not even one criticised our actions, the veteran president continued.
There is no country in SADC (the Southern African Development Community) that can stand up and say Zimbabwe has faulted. 
SADC does not do that, it is not a court but an organisation of 14 countries that cooperates with each other and supports each other.
Tsvangirai's arrest and subsequent assault on March 11 while trying to attend an anti-government rally was widely condemned by the West but the SADC summit, which was meant to address the crisis in Zimbabwe, ended up with a statement of solidarity with the 83-year-old Mugabe's government.
Explosives detonated accidentally at a training camp used by Hamas's armed wing in the southern Gaza Strip on Friday, killing one person and wounding at least 10 others, local residents said.
A Hamas source in the area told Reuters that the blast was the result of a work accident in which an explosive device went off accidentally during training at a facility in the village of al-Qarara near the impoverished town of Khan Younis. 
The source identified the dead man as 21-year-old Kamel Musa, a Hamas militant.
An Israeli army spokeswoman confirmed that the Israeli military was not involved.
Unknown gunmen shot dead two people believed to be undocumented immigrants and wounded a third when the vehicle they were traveling in was shot upon in southern Arizona early on Friday, police said.
The gunmen killed a man and a woman traveling in a pickup truck some 30 miles (50 km) south of Tucson, Pima County Sheriff's Department said.
Spokeswoman Dawn Barkman said the dead were believed to be Mexican immigrants traveling with three family groups from the poor southern Mexican state of Chiapas.
Each year U.S. border police catch more than a million undocumented immigrants crossing north from Mexico, many of them through the desert corridor south of Tucson. 
There are an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States.
Last month gunmen shot dead three Guatemalan immigrants and wounded two others in an attack on a back road northwest of Tucson. 
Investigators in that incident said rival people-trafficking networks were likely responsible.
Police say increased security on the U.S.-Mexico border has made human trafficking a more profitable activity, resulting in increased violence among smugglers.
A smuggling ring that Arizona police say flew thousands of illegal immigrants across the United States from the Phoenix area was busted earlier this week with 16 people indicted, authorities said on Thursday.
Authorities said nearly $2 million in bookings were made by the ring.
The head of French oil company Total's operations in Guinea has been released after a 24-hour kidnap ordeal, the oil firm said on Friday.
The director of Total Guinea was freed safe and sound at 1930 (Paris time, 1730 GMT), a Total spokesman said.
He declined to name the official but Guinean Web site Guineenews named him as Benoit Gaborit. 
Total said it had not paid a ransom to secure his release.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to arrive at the Jordanian Red Sea port of Aqaba later Saturday on the first leg of a Middle East tour that also includes the Palestinian territories, Israel and Lebanon.
Merkel, who is accompanied by a powerful government delegation, is due to have talks with King Abdullah II on latest regional developments, foremost the outcome of the Arab summit conference that was concluded in Riyadh on Thursday, officials said.
The two leaders were expected to review efforts under way to ensure a resumption of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, including the Arab Peace Initiative which was re-adopted by Arab leaders at the Riyadh conference, they added.
Ahead of her Middle East tour, Merkel talked over telephone with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia Friday to review with him latest regional developments.
Since its assumption of the European Union presidency at the beginning of 2007, Berlin has been involved in active diplomacy to push forward the stalled Middle East peace talks.
The Arab peace plan, which was originally proposed by the Saudi monarch when he was crown prince in 2002, envisages extending recognition to Israel by all Arab states after it quits the Arab lands it occupied in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Merkel's talks with King Abdullah were also expected to focus on bilateral ties between the two countries, particularly future German aid to Jordan.
According to a German embassy statement, Germany is Jordan's number one European trading partner, with bilateral trade amounting to around 749 million euros in 2006.
Germany is also one of Jordan's biggest international donors. 
German economic assistance to Jordan so far stood at about 1.2 billion euros, the embassy said.
Ethiopia said on Friday its military had killed 200 Islamic insurgents during a major offensive against rebels in the Somali capital Mogadishu.
Ethiopia has killed 200 armed remnants of the Islamic Courts Union and wounded many others, Ethiopia's Information Ministry said in a statement broadcast on national television.
Three car bombs killed eight people and wounded dozens as Iraq's relentless insurgency and sectarian violence continued on Saturday, security officials said.
Four people were killed and 16 more wounded when a car bomb exploded outside Al-Sadr hospital in Baghdad's Shiite enclave of Sadr City. 
A second car bomb killed two policemen and wounded 23, including many policemen, near a service station in the central Shiite city of Hilla, police said.
They were guarding the fuel station when the bomb exploded, also destroying 10 cars that were waiting for petrol.
In the town of Tuz Khurmatu, near the northern oil hub of Kirkuk, another two civilians were killed and 11 wounded when a car bomb exploded in a central square, local police chief Abbas Mohammed Amin said.
Insurgents have carried out massive attacks across Iraq this week, killing more than 400 people in the past four days alone.
South Korea and Japan started talks on Saturday focusing on North Korea's nuclear weapons programmes and a row over wartime sex slavery, South Korean officials said.
Foreign Minister Song Min-Soon and his Japanese counterpart Taro Aso met on the South Korean holiday island of Jeju in a follow-up to Song's visit to Tokyo last December.
Aso is expected to reaffirm his cooperation with Song to follow up on North Korea's commitment to dismantling its nuclear programmes, Japanese officials said, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency.
North Korea agreed in principle last month to disable its nuclear programmes under a deal which also foresees normalisation of relations with Japan and the United States. 
But progress on implementing the February 13 accord has been stalled over North Korea's frozen bank accounts.
A meeting this month on normalising Japan-North Korea relations broke down when Tokyo insisted on getting answers about the fate of kidnapped citizens.
North Korea has acknowledged kidnapping 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s to train its spies. 
It returned five victims and their families and says the rest are dead. 
Japan says the other abductees are alive and that more Japanese were snatched than Pyongyang has admitted. 
It says until there are positive developments on abductions, it will not help fund aid promised under the February agreement reached during six-nation talks aimed at North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Seoul in the past has criticised Tokyo's insistence on raising abductions during six-party talks which involve Russia, the United States and China, japan and the two Koreas.
Saturday's talks also follow a recent uproar in South Korea over Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's remarks that there was no evidence to prove the Japanese government forced Asian women into sexual slavery in World War Two.
Seoul has expressed deep regrets over Abe's remarks made earlier this month.
Minister Song is expected to raise the issue during his meeting with Aso, a South Korean foreign ministry official was quoted as saying on condition of anonymity by Yonhap news agency.
A dispute over a chain of islets called Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan is also expected to be raised. 
The two sides want to agree rules for marine surveys around the islands to avoid future clashes, a diplomat said in the lead up to the talks.
At least 22 Islamists were arrested in overnight raids as Bangladesh strengthened security nationwide on Saturday after authorities hanged six top Muslim militants, police said.
The 22 Islamists, all alleged activists of the group Hizbut Tahrir Bangladesh, were arrested as they watched anti-US footage of the Iraq war at a house in the capital Dhaka, city police chief Nayeem Ahmed said.
We have arrested them on suspected extremist links. 
We found videos showing the US war in Iraq, leaflets and other suspicious extremist materials. 
They also broke the government's emergency laws on political gatherings, he said.
Hizbut Tahrir, which aims to establish a global Islamic empire through peaceful political means, is banned in many countries but not in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. 
Police said they also carried out raids across the country, one day after six top Islamic militants, including the leader of the outlawed Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), were executed in four different jails.
The militants were sentenced to death last year for an attack that killed two judges in November 2005. 
Authorities say the JMB was also behind 400  coordinated blasts that shook the country in August that year.
An additional 2,000 police were deployed in key spots in Dhaka to prevent any revenge JMB attacks, Ahmed said.
We don't want to leave anything to chance, he said.
Some JMB militants have been arrested in recent days so we think remnants of the group are still there.
Speaking to Deutschlandfunk, Melissa Fleming said it was incomprehensible that Tehran was not opening its uranium enrichment programme to inspection.
She noted that Iran had gained access to related materials illegally in the past and concealed nuclear experiments.
Fleming added that Iran had a basic right to operate nuclear facilities, provided that this was done in a transparent and legal way.
An Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter crashed in the Siachen glacier in India-administered Kashmir on Wednesday and two of its pilots were missing, a news agency reported.
The indigenously-made Cheetah helicopter took off from the Siachen base camp, situated at an altitude of 4,999 metres, and crashed at about 7 am local time (1.30 am GMT), official sources told the PTI news agency.
The Indian Army and IAF have launched a search operation to find the missing pilots. 
The cause of the crash was not known as yet, the news agency reported.
India and Pakistan have been holding talks on resolving their border dispute over the Siachen glacier, also known as the world's highest battleground.
The talks are part of the peace talks also known as the composite dialogue process which India and Pakistan launched in early 2004.
Both India and Pakistan claim the glacier, located north of the line of control, that divides parts of Kashmir administered by the two nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours.
The two countries have stationed troops on the 76-kilometre-long glacier at a height of 21,000 feet, at considerable cost to their economies and human life due to the inhospitable conditions.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao arrived in Tokyo Wednesday for a summit meeting, the first visit by a Chinese premier in almost seven years.
Wen's visit, which is seen as an indication of improvement of bilateral ties, is expected to focus on strategic bilateral relationships, as well as cooperation in environment and energy-related issues.
Ahead of his arrival in Tokyo, Wen was quoted as saying that he considered the summit meeting with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe a true ice-melting trip.
Abe visited Beijing in October, a month after he took office, in an effort to mend strained ties with China.
Diplomacy between the two nations deteriorated under the former Japanese premier Junichiro Koizumi, whose repeated visits to the war-related Yasukuni Shrine angered Asian nations, especially China and South Korea.
Abe has not visited the shrine, which honours 2.5 million war dead including convicted war criminals. But he remains mum over whether he plans to do so during his premiership.
Abe's visit to Beijing as a prime minister, however, helped resume interaction between leaders of the two nations. 
During the summit on Wednesday, the Japanese premier was to announce his planned visit to Beijing in the fall.
Japan's top government spokesman said Wednesday that Tokyo hoped to see both sides reaching out to produce good results in building a mutually beneficial relationship.
Prime Minister Abe took a big step forward last October when he decided to visit China to mend relations. 
We don't think there is any 'ice' left, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki said.
The two nations have shown close cooperation in the efforts to denuclearize North Korea and set up a research team to resolve disputes over history.
Earlier Wednesday, China lifted a four-year ban and agreed to resume imports of Japanese rice, expecting the first shipment of 25 tons in early July.
Some issues remain unsolved, however, the two sides are apart in the joint gas exploration project in the East China Sea.
Abe was expected to express concern over the lack of transparency in China's military buildup.
The Chinese premier was expected to adress the Japanese parliament Thursday morning, meet Emperor Akihito and business and political leaders, as well as joining university students in a game of baseball.
China and Japan celebrate the 35th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relationship this year. 
Heavy fighting between government troops and Tamil Tigers in northern Sri Lanka has left 21 people dead on both sides, the defence ministry said Wednesday.
The clashes erupted when rebels fired mortars against military positions late Tuesday across a front line at Omanthai, the main crossing point between government- and Tiger-held territory.
The ministry said one government soldier was killed and four others wounded, adding intercepted rebel radio communication showed 20 rebels were killed in the military retaliation.
However, Tamil Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan denied losing 20 fighters and placed rebel casualties at three dead.
He said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) recovered the bodies of eight Sri Lankan troops.
The Omanthai crossing was shut for the second straight day Wednesday following the shelling.
The military said the LTTE were shelling government positions to obstruct the transport of supplies across the front line.
The International Red Cross this week expressed concern over a sharp rise in civilian deaths in the northern and eastern regions.
Journalists have not been allowed into rebel-held areas by Sri Lankan authorities since April last year.
On Saturday, suspected rebels blew up a passenger bus in the northern district of Vavuniya, killing eight people and wounding 25.
More than 4,000 people died between December 2005 and the first week of March 2007, including 675 civilians and 1,040 security personnel, according to defence ministry figures.
The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has claimed more than 60,000 lives.
North Korea's parliament on Wednesday sacked the country's premier Pak Pong-Ju and replaced him with transport minister Kim Yong-Il, state media said.
The Supreme People's Assembly session relieved deputy Pak Pong-Ju of premiership and elected deputy Kim Yong-Il premier of the cabinet of the DPRK (North Korea), the official Korean Central News Agency said.
The agency gave no explanation for the sacking of Pak, 67, who had held the post since September 2003 and was theoretically the head of government.
The agency also said Kim Yong-Chun was elected vice-chairman of the country's National Defence Commission during the session, which was presided over by the nation's leader, Kim Jong-Il.
In practice, all power in the reclusive communist state is centred on Kim Jong-Il, son of the nation's founding father and the focus of a vast personality cult.
Kim Yong-Nam, president of parliament's presidium, acts as head of state and receives diplomatic credentials.
The legislature, a rubber-stamp body, convenes irregularly once or twice a year.
The Arab League on Wednesday announced the postponement until May 15 of a Somali reconciliation conference originally set for next week to allow more time for preparations.
The delay will allow a full opportunity to prepare for the conference, Samir Hosni, the League's representative for Africa, explained to reporters.
He added that former Somali president Ali Mahdi Mohammed, head of the prepatory committee, would be visiting Cairo in the coming days to discuss preparations for the conference.
Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed originally announced in March that a reconciliation conference of 3,000 people from Somalia and abroad would be held on April 16, without specifying who would actually be involved.
But Somalia's Foreign Minister Ismail Mohamed Hurre said last week that the conference was to be delayed.
Diplomats at a meeting of the Somalia Contact Group last week said the deposed Islamic Courts Union would not be represented, but members could participate in other capacities such as clan representatives.
International officials have cited the holding of a conference and the establishment of a truce between the warring factions tearing the country apart as a prerequisite for the further deployment of African Union peacekeepers.
Two more US soldiers have been killed in Baghdad, the US military reported Wednesday, taking its losses to 34 this month alone.
A roadside bomb killed one US soldier and wounded two others on Wednesday when their patrol was attacked, the military reported.
Another soldier was killed and one more wounded when their patrol also came under attack in a southern district of Baghdad on Tuesday.
The latest fatalities brought the military's losses in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,282, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
Israel scrambled fighter jets to escort an American commercial passenger plane to landing on Wednesday, Israeli officials said.
An Airports Authority spokeswoman said Continental Airlines' Flight 90 was intercepted after it failed to identify itself upon entering Israeli airspace. 
The plane, a Boeing 777, was on a scheduled flight from Newark, New Jersey in the United States. 
All passengers and crew disembarked safely, Israeli officials said.
The Transportation Ministry said it was investigating whether there was a technical reason for the initial lack of communication between the plane and Israeli ground control.
A suicide car bomber wounded eight civilians in southern Afghanistan Wednesday, as officials said 13 Taliban died in a US airstrike and four more were killed by a mine they were planting.
The suicide attacker blew up his vehicle near a NATO convoy in the main southern city of Kandahar, the birthplace of the 1996-2001 Taliban regime whose remnants are now behind a bloody insurgency.
Police said eight civilians were wounded and the bomber died. 
The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force headquarters in Kabul confirmed an explosion and said its troops did not suffer any casualties.
No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but the Taliban have vowed to launch a wave of suicide attacks this year.
Separately on Tuesday, US-led coalition and Afghan troops called in warplanes after Taliban rebels attacked them with mortars and rockets in the troubled Sangin district of southern Helmand province, the coalition said.
Coalition aircraft arrived and dropped munitions which resulted in the destruction of one enemy compound, a bunker and a vehicle, it said in a statement.
There were an estimated 13 Taliban fighters killed during the engagement, it said, adding there were no civilian casualties.
The airstrike came a day after coalition jets killed four Taliban fighters in Sangin district.
About 1,000 Afghan security forces and NATO-led troops took Sangin out of Taliban control at the weekend without facing any major resistance, according to authorities.
Helmand is one of the most violent provinces in Afghanistan, where drug traffickers are said to fund the Taliban.
Meanwhile, four Taliban fighters were killed when a landmine meant to target foreign and Afghan troops exploded as they planted it in the southern province of Ghazni, a district official said.
More than 1,000 people, mostly militants, have died so far this year in violence linked to the fundamentalist Taliban, who were ousted by a US-led invasion after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
The US-led coalition has around 12,000 troops in Afghanistan while more than 30,000 soldiers are deployed in the Central Asian nation with the separate ISAF contingent.
Morocco on Wednesday presented its plan to grant self-rule to the disputed Western Sahara territory to United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon, an official said in Rabat.
The entire plan for autonomy has just been submitted by the ambassador to the UN Mustapha Sahel, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Moroccan Information Minister Nabil Benabdellah told a government meeting that the document was titled the Moroccan Initiative for Negotiating Self-Autonomy for Western Sahara.
Benabdellah, who doubles as the government spokesman, added that the document would serve as a platform for negotiations between the concerned parties.
Morocco annexed the desolate but phosphate-rich northwest African territory after the withdrawal of the region's former colonial power, Spain, and neighbour Mauritania in the 1970s, settling it with around 300,000 Moroccans in 1975.
A war ensued with the Algerian-backed armed Polisario Front independence movement, which contested Rabat's sovereignty, ending only in 1991 with a UN-brokered ceasefire.
Since then, the United Nations has tried several times to organise a referendum on self-determination.
The Moroccan official said that copies of the document had not yet been sent to either Algeria or the Polisario Front but added that Rabat had not ruled out doing so in the future.
The United States threw its support behind the Moroccan plan after talks in Washington Tuesday between Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns and a delegation from Rabat.
Burns called the plan a serious and credible proposal to provide real autonomy for the Western Sahara, according to a statement released Wednesday.
The United States hopes Morocco's presentation of its initiative to the United Nations will spur discussion and create an opportunity for Morocco and the Polisario to engage in direct negotiations, without preconditions, to resolve the Western Sahara dispute, he said.
The UN has apologized for postponing the opening of an exhibit marking the anniversary of the 1994 Rwanda genocide over Turkish objections to a reference to the killing of Armenians in Turkey during World War I, the Rwandan ambassador said Wednesday.
We were contacted by UN Under Secretary General (for public information Kiyotaka Akasaka) who told me they are reviewing the text (of the exhibit), Rwanda's permanent UN representative Joseph Nsengimana told AFP. 
He apologizes. 
The exhibit will (officially) open very soon.
The exhibit, which was to have been inaugurated by UN chief Ban Ki-moon Monday, is meant to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide during which Hutu extremists killed some 800,000 people, most of them ethnic minority Tutsis.
Farhan Haq, a UN spokesman, said the controversy arose when a Turkish diplomat walked by the exhibit as it was being put up last week and complained about a reference to the killing of several hundred thousand Armenians in Turkey during World War I.
He said the reference was on a small panel with a quotation from Raphael Lemkin, the Polish-born Jewish lawyer who coined the word genocide in 1943, had earlier shown interest in the Armenian genocide and campaigned in the League of Nations to ban what he called barbarity and vandalism.
Turkey, the successor of the Ottoman Empire, categorically denies claims of genocide and says thousands of Turks and Armenians were killed in civil strife during 1915-1917 when Armenians took up arms for independence in eastern Anatolia and sided with Russian troops invading the crumbling empire.
Much to Turkey's ire, many countries have recognized the killings as genocide.
Haq said a review panel made up of officials of the UN departments of public information and political affairs as well as those with expertise in genocide affairs would now look over the photographs and the text of the exhibit ahead of the inauguration.
This is what they were supposed to have done, he said. 
I am hoping it will be very quick.
The exhibit is partly organized by Aegis Trust, a British-based international organization lobbying to prevent genocide worldwide.
An anteater attacked a young zookeeper in Argentina, ripping open the woman's abdomen and legs with its long claws and leaving her in critical condition, a doctor said on Wednesday.
This female anteater apparently attacked her keeper at a Buenos Aires-area zoo to protect her offspring.
The unusual attack damaged the zookeeper's stomach, liver and lungs, said Jose Potito, director of the hospital where the woman was being treated.
The woman's condition is very serious, Potito told local TV channel America.
Anteaters, which can measure up to 9.2 feet (2.8 meters) long and weigh as much as 110 pounds (50 kg), are native to Latin America and have toothless snouts.
They are usually not aggressive, but their long, knife-like claws can do serious damage to predators when they defend themselves.
A worker at the zoo described the attack as an accident and said the animal was not punished in response.
Anteaters are endangered, according to the Argentine Wildlife Foundation, which uses the distinctive-looking animal as its symbol for protecting local species.
Climate change could diminish North American water supplies and trigger disputes between the United States and Canada over water reserves already stressed by industry and agriculture, U.N. experts said on Wednesday.
More heat waves like those that killed more than 100 people in the United States in 2006, storms like the killer hurricanes that struck the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 and wildfires are likely in North America as temperatures rise, according to a new report that provided regional details on a U.N. climate panel study on global warming issued in Brussels on April 6.
Severe weather already costs North America tens of billions of dollars annually in productivity and damaged property, and those costs are expected to rise, the U.N. report said.
The broadest effects of climate change will be water problems across the entire continent including more frequent droughts, urban flooding and a scramble for water from the Great Lakes, which border both the United States and Canada.
Water was an issue in every region but in very different ways and very different places, Michael MacCracken, a review editor of the report, said in a telephone interview.
Unlike many continents, North America has no east to west mountain ranges that limit droughts by forcing rapidly moving wet air to release rain, said MacCracken, also chief scientist for climate change at the Climate Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit group.
Cities will also be threatened as glacial melt leads to higher ocean levels. 
Late in the 21st century, severe flooding that occurs in New York once every 500 years could happen as often as once in 50 years, putting at risk much of the infrastructure in the New York region, the report said.
Droughts would also occur more often in the U.S. Midwest and Southwest as warmer temperatures evaporate soil moisture.
Those droughts could diminish underground supplies like the Edwards Aquifer in Texas, which supplies 2 million people with water, by up to 40 percent, and cut levels of the Ogallala aquifer which underlies eight U.S. states, the report said.
During droughts like the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, U.S. farmers pumped water from underground aquifers to save their fields through irrigation. 
Much of that water is now gone, said MacCracken. 
We've used up our savings bank.
Tight underground water supplies could kick off a scramble for large above-ground supplies in the Great Lakes, the report said. 
Spats have already occurred over diversion of the lakes' water for distant cities and farms, while calls have increased for channeling water to the Mississippi River to supply U.S. cities during hot summers.
Problems are also expected to intensify as warmer temperatures lower water levels through evaporation. 
Climate change will exacerbate these issues and create new challenges for binational cooperation, the report said.
Top Democrats in Congress denounced Wednesday the Pentagon's decision to extend troop deployments in Iraq as the consequence of White House policy failures.
Today's announcement just underscores the fact that the burden of the war in Iraq has fallen upon our troops and their families, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.
The Bush Administration has failed to create a plan to fully equip and train our troops, bring them home safely and soon, and provide our veterans with the quality care they deserve, she said.
Extending the tours of all active-duty army personnel is an unacceptable price for our troops and their families to pay, Pelosi said.
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced Wednesday that the deployment of US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan were extended to 15 months, up from 12 months, effective immediately.
Once again the failures of this administration are being underwritten by our troops, said Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman Carl Levin.
The cost of this will fall on the backs of the brave men and women already serving in harm's way, and their families, he said.
Joseph Biden, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, If the administration insists on keeping this many troops in Iraq into next year, it will have to send soldiers back on third, fourth and fifth tours.
The announcement undercuts the president's claim that Congress is straining the military and keeping soldiers from their families  and exposes it as nothing more than empty political rhetoric, said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.
Republican Charles Hagel, who has joined Democrats in their call for a withdrawal, said, Maintaining this tempo of operations will have drastic and lasting consequences for our nation's military readiness and unnecessarily endangers our ability to react to any other crisis in the world.
We are on a very dangerous course, Hagel said.
Salsa singer-songwriter Marc Anthony failed to pay taxes for four years in a row and owes $2.5 million in back taxes and fines, the Manhattan District Attorney said on Wednesday.
Anthony has not been charged, but his manager, accountant and his three companies all pleaded guilty to tax crimes in a plea deal reached with Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. 
Anthony must pay the $2.5 million by June 1.
The New York-born singer, who is married to singer/actress Jennifer Lopez was not charged because he relied on his accountant to file his tax returns, Morgenthau said.
But between 2001 and 2004, years when Anthony  the biggest-selling salsa artist of all time  released the albums Libre, Mended and Amar Sin Mentiras, he failed to pay taxes on $15.5 million in income, according to the DA's office.
Lopez, who married Anthony in 2004, was not a subject of the investigation, Morgenthau said.
He thought that he could rely on his manager and his accountant, Morgenthau said of Anthony.
Anthony's lawyer was not immediately available for comment.
Anthony's manager, Bigram Zayes  who is also Anthony's brother  and Philip Sarna, the business manager and accountant for Anthony and his three companies, also failed to pay their personal city, state and federal income taxes.
Those companies, which handle Anthony's tours, the publication of his music and lyrics and his management, collect income which is then turned over to Anthony.
Both men will be sentenced in June.
A traditional Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables and nuts during childhood appears to protect against symptoms of asthma and nasal allergies, according to a new study.
There has been increasing interest in the role of nutrition in the development of asthma, and in the modulating effect of nutrition on environmental exposures, Dr. Paul Cullinan, of Royal Brompton Hospital and National Heart and Lung Institute, London, UK, and colleagues write in the medical journal Thorax.
In their study, the researchers surveyed 690 children between the ages of 7 and 18 years in rural Crete. 
Parents completed questionnaires on their children's respiratory and allergic symptoms, and diets.
The team reports that 80 percent of children ate fresh fruit and 68 percent ate vegetables at least twice a day.
Intake of grapes, oranges, apples, and fresh tomatoes protected against wheeze and nasal allergies, and a high intake of nuts reduced the likelihood of wheezing, Cullinan and associates found. 
Margarine, on the other hand, was linked to an increased risk of wheeze nasal allergies.
A diet high in antioxidants may prevent the expression of allergic disease in this population, the investigators conclude.
Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Mitoji Yabunaka on Wednesday requested that Iran stop enriching uranium in compliance with a recent U.N. Security Council resolution, Japanese officials said.
Yabunaka, who was visiting Tehran, conveyed the message when he met with Iranian Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki, they said.
Motaki reiterated that nuclear development is justified within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and that Iran will not join talks with conditions attached, indicating that it does not plan to stop uranium enrichment, according to the officials.
Motaki also said Iran actively supports the governments in Afghanistan and Iraq because their stability is important to Iran, they said.
Iran has repeatedly said that uranium enrichment, which the United Nations has demanded it stop, is its right and will not be abandoned.
The country has continued its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of a U.N. Security Council resolution passed in December, which imposed trade sanctions on Iran for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment activities and gave it until Feb. 21 to comply or face broader sanctions.
Iran defied the resolution, prompting the Security Council to unanimously adopt another resolution imposing additional measures on Iran last month.
World leaders reacted with horror to the double suicide bombing in Algiers claimed by Al-Qaeda that killed at least 23 people and wounded 160 Wednesday.
UN chief Ban Ki-moon strongly condemns the terrorist bombings that occurred today in Algeria, UN deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe told a press briefing.
Ban believes this deplorable incident, the latest in a series of similar attacks in the Maghreb region as a whole, shows the need for concerted international action against terrorism which has the effect of undermining the normal functioning of societies and disrupting the lives of ordinary people, she added in a statement.
In Washington, both the White House and the State Department condemned the attacks.
These horrific acts indiscriminately killed members of the security services and civilians alike, said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack.
The United States condemns the terrorist attacks, he added.
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said US authorities were already working with their Moroccan and Algerian counterparts.
We stand with them as they try to find out the cause or the impetus for the attacks, she said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his sorrow and indignation in a statement released by the Kremlin.
This criminal act of terrorism once again confirms that terrorism has no ethnic or religious identity and is one of the greatest challenges the entire international community faces today, he added.
In the Middle East, the secretary general of the Arab League, Amr Mussa, condemned the attacks.
The monarchies of the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar also denounced the attacks in separate statements.
In Brussels, European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said: I condemn with the strongest force the bloody attacks perpetrated today in Algiers which caused a high number of casualties.
These were odious and cowardly acts, he added, offering his condolences to the families of the victims.
French President Jacques Chirac condemned what he called the terrible attacks in a message of solidarity to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. 
Algeria was until 1962 a French colony.  
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said in a telegram to Bouteflika that he was profoundly moved by the terrible news of the tragic terrorist attacks perpetrated today in Algiers.
I want to express in my name and in the name of the government of Spain my most profound solidarity and my strong condemnation.
Twenty-nine mainly Moroccan accused are on trial in Spain for the March 11, 2004 train bombings in Madrid which killed 191 people and wounded hundreds in the country's worst terrorist attack.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Thursday became the first Chinese leader to address the Japanese parliament in more than two decades, saying he hoped his trip would bring in a new era of warmer relations.
If (Japanese) Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe's visit to China in October was a trip to break the ice, I want my visit to be an ice-melting visit, he said. 
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, in a speech to Japan's parliament on Thursday, urged Japan to match its words of apology for Tokyo's wartime aggression with action.
We sincerely hope Japan will use practical actions to manifest its public statements and promises, Wen told the Japanese lawmakers.
Wen, making the first visit to Japan by a Chinese premier since 2000, also called Japan's past military invasion of China a calamity but said the Chinese people wanted to exist in friendship with the Japanese people.
The Japanese invasion of China was a calamity for the Chinese people, Wen said in the speech, delivered against a backdrop of the national flags of the two Asian giants.
But he added, The Chinese people want to exist in friendship with the Japanese people.
Wen is on a three-day visit aimed at deepening a warming in long-strained ties begun with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's trip to Beijing in October.
An explosion on a bridge in Baghdad on Thursday killed at least six people and sent several cars plunging into the Tigris River below, Iraqi police said.
Police said the blast, which occurred during the morning rush hour, had damaged the Sarafiya bridge in northern Baghdad.
One of its girders had collapsed. 
Four or five cars had fallen into the river and the death toll could rise, police added. 
Iraqiya state television said a number of people had been killed and wounded.
The Tigris River cuts Baghdad in half and the Sarafiya bridge is a key artery in the northern part of the city.
U.S. and Iraqi forces launched a security crackdown in the capital two months ago that has managed to reduce death squad killings, but car bombs have remained a problem.
Checkpoints are placed at the entrances to most of the many bridges that cross the Tigris in Baghdad.
The security operation in Baghdad is seen as a last ditch attempt to halt Iraq's slide into sectarian civil war.
The U.S. military said on Wednesday that for the third month in a row, civilian casualties had declined in Baghdad but that in the same period there had been an increase in casualties across Iraq.
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Thursday called for international help to rebuild his war-torn country, saying the people were struggling to rise from the ashes of conflict.
Because of its abundance in resources such as oil and gas, Iraq has a great potential to become an advanced country, he told South Korean business leaders.
However, it is true that reconstruction is being delayed and all facilities are in ruins. But the Iraqi people are making utmost efforts to rise from the ashes, he said through an interpreter.
Iraqis are striving for democracy and peace in the face of near-daily attacks by insurgents, he said.
For reconstruction, Iraq needs help from its friends...we hope our friends join us in efforts to rebuild the country.
Maliki arrived Wednesday from Japan for a three-day visit, accompanied by his oil, energy, industrial policy and urban planning ministers.
He said his delegation had many proposals for joint projects in the oil, electricity, road construction and petrochemical sectors, and invited South Korean firms to expand investment in Iraq.
Iraq always welcomes you with open arms. 
Windows of opportunity are open wide and all kinds of conveniences will be provided, he said.
Even though we were late in beginning the reconstruction work, we want to catch up.
South Korea's Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry said Seoul signed a memorandum of understanding Thursday on developing oil and gas fields in northern Iraq.
Maliki later met President Roh Moo-Hyun and discussed ways to cooperate more closely in natural resources, energy and construction, the presidential Blue House said.
The Iraqi prime minister was to tour industrial plants in the southern city of Ulsan on Friday.
South Korea, with 1,300 soldiers working on relief and reconstruction in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil, has the third largest foreign force after the United States and Britain, but is looking to pull them out by year's end.
It has also provided some 220 million dollars in aid to rebuild the country.
India on Thursday test-fired a nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile which can reach the Chinese cities of Beijing and Shanghai, defence officials said.
The launch of the Agni-III missile took place from Wheeler Island, 180 kilometres (110 miles) northeast of Bhubaneswar, capital of the eastern state of Orissa.
Officials at the facility did not immediately say whether the test was successful.
The missile took off vertically into a clear sky leaving behind a thick column of white and yellow smoke, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
It was the second test of Agni-III, a two-stage solid fuelled missile which has a diameter of 1.8 metres (six feet) and can carry nuclear or conventional warheads.
The first test of the missile, with a range of up to 4,000 kilometres (2,480 miles), ended in failure last July when it developed problems after a successful take-off and crashed into the sea without hitting a designated target.
The technical glitches in its heat shield and other material related faults have been rectified, an unnamed defence ministry official told The Times of India.
Agni-III was originally scheduled for testing in 2003 but it was believed to have been deferred amid moves by arch-rivals India and Pakistan to bury decades of mutual hostility.
An Indian foreign ministry source in New Delhi said India, which signed an agreement with Pakistan on the pre-notification of ballistic missile tests in October 2005, had informed Islamabad of the latest Agni-III test.
India, which conducted nuclear weapons tests in 1998, has developed a series of nuclear and conventional missile systems as part of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)'s Integrated Missile Development Programme which was launched in 1983.
The Agni is one of five missiles developed by the DRDO.
New Delhi has already begun the production of two variants of the Agni   a 700-kilometre (434-mile) Agni-I and the 2,500-kilometre (1,550-mile) range Agni-II after flight-testing both the ballistic missiles numerous times since 1993.
The other four missiles are the Prithvi, the surface-to-air Trishul (Trident), multi-purpose Akash (Sky), and the anti-tank Nag (Cobra).
A spokesman for an Iraqi insurgent group  said Wednesday that his group was willing to negotiate with the United States if the power withdraws from the country.
Ibrahim al-Shemmari, spokesman of the predominantly Sunni Iraq Islamic Army (IIA), also said in an interview with al-Jazeera television that there was a widening gap between his group and al-Qaeda forces in Iraq.
And he claimed that insurgent forces have killed 25,000 Americans - a number that is disputed by carefully kept US figures.
Al-Shemmari described his group as including faithful elements from the dissolved Iraqi army but excluding all Baathists.
The Sunni insurgency formed after the ouster of president Saddam Hussein in 2003, who had ruled Iraq with an iron hand that kept the minority Sunnis in control over the majority Shiites.
Since then, all-out lethal conflict has broken out between the Sunni insurgent forces and Shiite militia, with the US-led coalition forces struggling to dampen the violence while foreign Sunni al-Qaeda fighters seeking to sew chaos wherever possible.
Al-Shemmari charged that the gap with al-Qaeda came about after it had killed 40 IIA fighters, but vowed that the group was seeking reconciliation to unify all the insurgent groups and fight until the US troops leave the country.
We are keen on the unification of all resistance groups.
We have written for this end to Osama bin Laden and other scholars, al-Shemmari said.
Al-Shemmari offered to enter into negotiations with the United States under certain conditions provided that an outside body like the European Union, Russia or Turkey hosted talks.
He said the group was prepared to enter into negotiations if the US Congress made a binding decision to withdraw US troops, even as it was seeking to unify the insurgent groups.
Our second condition is that the Americans recognize the resistance as a legitimate party, he said.
US Congress has set a timetable for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq by 2008, as part of a funding bill for the war. 
US President George W Bush has threatened to veto the bill. 
Al-Shemmari called the conflict over the financing of the US troops in Iraq a good omen.
The IIA official claimed that about 25,000 Americans were killed in Iraq since the US-led force invaded the country in 2003, according to the number of American vehicles its fighters had destroyed.
We only count the occupants of US vehicles completely destroyed in our operations, he said.
In Washington, the private think tank, Brookings Institute, which keeps a widely respected tally of deaths in Iraq, reports only 470 deaths of foreign non-Iraqi private military contractors. 
In all, it estimated there were more than 20,000 private military contractors serving in Iraq, but did not specify their nationality.
Another website, Iraq Body Count, estimates Iraqi civilian deaths at 61,000 to 67,000.
Al-Shemmari faulted the official figures of the US military command in Iraq, which officially puts the number of troops killed in the past four years at about 3,243. 
He said the number neglected the mercenaries and personnel involved in the logistic services.
Al-Shemmari said that the former Iraqi army included both faithful personnel and corrupt Baathists, which was why Baathists were excluded from the IIA. 
He dismissed as propaganda reports that Baathists, belonging to the ruling party of former President Saddam Hussein, represented the backbone of the Iraqi insurgency.
He pointed out that the IIA had benefited from all previous guerrilla warfare experiments, including the Vietnam war, in its operations against the US-led multinational force in Iraq. 
He blasted the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite, as a sectarian cabinet which is part of the Iranian project.
Two NATO soldiers were killed Thursday in separate explosions in Afghanistan, taking the number of foreign soldiers killed in the country to 11 in less than a week, the International Security Assistance Force said.
Another soldier was wounded in the two blasts, which occurred 30 minutes apart along the same road in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF said in a statement, without giving any further details.
The two ISAF convoys were approximately eight kilometers apart, conducting independent operations in support of the Afghan government, when they were attacked within 30 minutes of each other, it said.
American soldiers are deployed in eastern Afghanistan, a volatile area that borders Pakistan.
Eight Canadian and one American soldiers have died in similar explosions in Afghanistan since Sunday.
On April 8, Easter Sunday, Canada suffered its heaviest single-day troop loss in 50 years with the death of six soldiers outside Kandahar.
Since the beginning of the year, 39 NATO and US-led coalition troops have died in Afghanistan. 
Some 170 were killed there in 2006.
A suicide bomber killed eight people in the Iraqi parliament on Thursday, slipping through multiple checkpoints in a brazen strike that challenged a major U.S.-backed security crackdown in Baghdad.
U.S. military spokesman Major-General William Caldwell said initial reports showed eight had been killed and 20 wounded in the blast which tore through a cafe where lawmakers were having lunch. 
State television said three of the dead were lawmakers.
It was the most serious breach of security in the Green Zone, the sprawling, heavily protected area in central Baghdad that houses parliament, government offices and the U.S. embassy.
U.S. President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who is on a trip to the Far East, condemned the attack, which Caldwell blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda.
The bold attack by a suicide bomber wearing an explosives vest came despite a two-month-old operation by thousands of U.S. and Iraqi troops in the capital regarded as a last chance to stop a slide to full-scale sectarian civil war.
A truck bomb also killed at least seven people on Sarafiya bridge in northern Baghdad, a main artery linking east and west Baghdad, destroying most of the steel structure and sending several cars plunging into the River Tigris below.
How explosives were smuggled into the Green Zone is likely to be the focus of an investigation. 
They would have had to pass through an outer checkpoint manned by U.S. and Iraqi troops and multiple inner checkpoints guarded by security contractors and foreign troops that are part of the U.S.-led coalition.
We are trying to backtrack all the systems to see how somebody was able to get a suicide vest into the Convention Centre where the members of parliament meet ... we are looking at who had access there, Caldwell told Reuters by telephone.
The U.S. military said this month that two explosives vests were found in the zone. A third suspected vest was known to have been missing and a hunt was launched to find it.
The Pentagon has launched a criminal investigation into an incident last month in which US marines allegedly opened fire on a crowd of Afghan civilians, officials said Thursday.
The March 4 incident was sparked when a suicide bomber ambushed a five-vehicle convoy carrying a US Marine Corps special operations unit on a busy highway between the eastern city of Jalalabad and the Pakistan border.
Witnesses said the marines fired indiscriminately on a crowd of civilians. 
The marines insisted they only opened fire after coming under attack from automatic weapons.
At least eight civilians were killed and 35 wounded, although the Afghan government said 10 Afghans were killed and 25 wounded as a result of return fire.
The US officer in charge of the investigation thought there were reasons why he should pass on the case to the Navy's criminal investigative unit, said Lieutenant Colonel Lou Leto, a spokesman for the US Central Command, in charge of US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The deaths sparked angry protests with drew hundreds of people converging on the the site of the attack, chanting Death to America and Death to (Afghan President Hamid) Karzai.
Two weeks after the incident, the marine unit involved in the shooting was ordered out of Afghanistan.
Photographers and cameramen working for international news organizations said their pictures and video of the aftermath of the attack were deleted by US forces.
The US military said the images were deleted to protect the integrity of the investigation.
We deeply regret the loss of life and casualties that resulted from the (suicide car bomb) attack and the actions that followed, Leto said in a statement.
A mob stoned to death an Asian man in Uganda on Thursday and two other people were killed when a protest at plans to axe parts of a rainforest reserve to grow sugarcane turned violent, police and witnesses said.
Regional police commander Edward Ochom told Reuters officers opened fire with tear gas and live rounds after demonstrators began attacking Asian businesses and a Hindu temple, angered by moves to expand an Indian-owned company's sugar plantations.
Three people have been confirmed dead, he said. 
One is an Asian man who was stoned to death by the rioters. 
The other two are Ugandans and we are still investigating their deaths.
A Reuters journalist saw the bloodied body of an Asian man in the street. 
Police blocked roads in the centre of the capital. 
Scores of demonstrators hurled rocks at them.
Protest organiser Frank Muramuzi said the march began peacefully before a misunderstanding with the police.
All of a sudden they opened fire with tear gas and live ammunition, Muramuzi said. 
Everyone scattered but two people were seen lying in the road. 
I don't know if they were killed or injured, but they have been rushed to hospital.
Police commanders had earlier approved the march, called to protest at plans to cut down thousands of hectares of Mabira Forest to expand the estate of local sugar company Scoul.
Scoul is part of the Indian-owned Mehta Group.
The controversy began last year when President Yoweri Museveni ordered a study into whether to axe 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) or nearly a third of Mabira.
Mabira which has been a nature reserve since 1932 is one of Uganda's last remaining patches of natural forest.
The government's proposal angered some parliamentarians and residents. 
They said the environmental costs of slashing the forest would far exceed the economic benefits of the plantation.
Environmentalists say destroying Mabira could have grave ecological consequences, from increased soil erosion to the drying up of rivers and rainfall, and the removal of a buffer against polluting nearby Lake Victoria.
An Ohio man suspected of joining al Qaeda and conspiring to bomb targets in Europe and the United States has been indicted and will appear in court on Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said.
The FBI arrested Christopher Paul, a 43-year-old U.S. citizen, late on Wednesday after a four-year investigation of his alleged involvement with al Qaeda in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Germany, the Justice Department said in a statement.
Paul joined al-Qaeda in 1991, the indictment said. 
He then trained and supported German co-conspirators planning to bomb European tourist resorts frequented by American citizens, as well as U.S. embassies, consulates and military bases overseas, it said. He also targeted a person in the United States, it said.
It did not say whether any of the suspected plans were carried out.
Paul also is suspected of conducting research, beginning in 2006, on remote-controlled boats, a model remote-controlled helicopter and flight simulators for commercial aircraft, the indictment said.
The indictment of Christopher Paul paints a disturbing picture of an American who traveled overseas to train as a violent jihadist, joined the ranks of al Qaeda, and provided military instruction and support to radical cohorts both here and abroad, Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Wainstein said.
Paul, a native of Columbus, Ohio, is due to appear in U.S. District Court in Columbus on Thursday. 
His attorney, Don Wolery, could not be immediately reached for comment.
A roadside bomb attack killed six Iraqi civilians taking the bus home from college and work near the northern oil hub of Kirkuk on Thursday, security and medical sources said.
Doctor Abdallah Mohammed Khorsheed said the bodies of six civilians were brought into hospital after the makeshift bomb exploded alongside the bus as it was headed to a neighbourhood outside Kirkuk.
Another 21 Iraqis were wounded in the attack, the latest violence increasingly rocking the troubled oil hub ahead of a referendum on its future status which under the constitution should take place by year-end.
A security official said the bus was carrying students and workers home from their place of study and employment in downtown Kirkuk.
Insurgent attacks are common in Kirkuk, which sits atop a third of the country's oil resources and is home to a fractious ethnic and sectarian mix.
Longstanding Kurdish demands for the city to be incorporated into their autonomous region in northern Iraq strongly opposed by Iraqi Arabs and neighbouring Turkey is the focus of this year's expected referendum.
A young Argentine zookeeper who worked on a giant anteater conservation project died on Thursday after she was attacked by an anteater who mauled her abdomen and legs with its sharp front claws.
Her injuries were very serious and when she was admitted she was already in critical condition, Jose Potito, director of the hospital, told Reuters.
Potito said Melisa Casco, 19, died after an operation to amputate one of her legs.
Casco worked at the Florencio Varela zoo outside Buenos Aires as part of a conservation and reproduction project involving endangered giant anteaters.
The zoo was closed on Thursday and not available for comment but a zoo worker on Wednesday described the attack as an accident.
Zoo workers told local media they did not see Tuesday's attack on Casco. 
Different reports said the anteater was male, or female, and may have been protecting offspring or was in heat.
Anteaters, which can measure up to 2.8 meters long and weigh as much as 50 kg, are native to Latin America and have toothless snouts.
They are usually not aggressive, but their long, knife-like claws can do serious damage to predators when they defend themselves.
NATO commanders have asked for 3,400 additional police and Army trainers for Afghanistan, a need the United States wants European allies to fill, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Thursday.
NATO has asked for about 3,400 training positions, and quite frankly we're having trouble, Gates said after meeting with defense ministers from countries with troops in Afghanistan's volatile southern region.
Gates said the group, including ministers from Canada, Britain, Australia and other countries, talked about approaching European allies that do not have troops engaged in combat in Afghanistan to fill the training requirement.
You have nations that are not willing to put combat troops in. ... Those who are not willing to do that or able to do that may be able to pick up the slack in this area where those of us who are contributing most of the combat forces don't have additional forces available, he said.
The request for more trainers came about six weeks ago, Gates said. 
About 60 percent of the 3,400 trainers are needed for Afghanistan's police and the rest for the army.
Those training needs come on top of other troop and equipment shortfalls previously identified by NATO commanders. 
The United States and Britain have contributed most of the troops to the Afghan mission, and officials have expressed frustration that other nations have not committed additional forces following commanders' call for more troops earlier this year.
Gates said the United States could provide some of the trainers, but he could not say how many. 
U.S. forces are already stretched thin by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as highlighted on Wednesday by the Pentagon's decision to extend the tours of all active-duty troops.
We can fill some of (the training positions) but we don't really have the ability right now to fill them all, he said.
Senegal honoured on Thursday five of its soldiers killed in Sudan's Darfur region and said it could withdraw from an overstretched African peacekeeping force there within weeks unless it was given firm U.N. backing.
The West African country, whose peacekeeping troops are widely respected, made the warning as U.N. negotiators drew close to persuading Sudan to allow 3,000 U.N. personnel to bolster the African Union (AU) mission in Darfur. 
Senegal has 538 soldiers in the 7,000-strong AU contingent in Darfur, a western Sudanese region the size of France where more than 200,000 people have been killed in political and ethnic conflict since 2003. 
Senegal believes that enough is enough, Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio told a news conference. If in the coming weeks we do not move toward a solution, which for Senegal means transforming the AU force into a U.N. mission, then we are going to withdraw our troops from Darfur.
The Senegalese warning followed a similar statement last month by another contributor to the Darfur force, Rwanda, whose President Paul Kagame demanded more resources for it.
Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's government has refused to accept non-African peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur, although he has agreed to others manning command centres and coordinating logistics. 
Khartoum has not agreed to a proposed AU-U.N. operation of more than 20,000 troops and police.
As Senegal received with military honours the bodies of the peacekeepers killed by an April 1 rebel ambush, the government had demanded in a written statement that the AU and Sudan put our soldiers in the best conditions to be able to carry out their mission and defend themselves.
AU officials have said the Darfur mission needs increased U.N. logistical assistance and more sophisticated defensive weapons. 
Sudan, however, has objected to U.N. proposals to equip the force with helicopter gunships.
The April 1 ambush on the Senegalese was the deadliest single assault on the African force since it was deployed in 2004. 
A Rwandan soldier was also killed in an April 10 attack.
At a military camp in downtown Dakar, relatives of the slain soldiers wept before their coffins, which were laid in a row draped with the green, yellow and red national flag. 
The dead soldiers were awarded posthumous decorations.
The entire Senegalese nation is in mourning, Gadio said at the ceremony.
He reiterated Senegal's willingness to participate in peacekeeping operations on the African continent. 
The world's biggest U.N. peacekeeping force, 17,000-strong and deployed in Democratic Republic of Congo, includes Senegalese troops.
Senegal's warning over the Darfur force appeared aimed as much at the AU and the international community as at the government of Sudan.
Senegal regrets the delay in the deployment of the hybrid operation which the Sudanese government had in fact approved before subsequently questioning it, the Senegalese government statement said.
Three Norwegian crew members died and another five were missing after their tugboat capsized in the North Sea on Thursday, British coast guards said.
A further seven personnel were rescued from the Bourbon Dolphin, a Norwegian anchor-handling supply tug, which capsized 75 miles (121 km) north of Scotland's Shetland Islands, a spokeswoman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said.
As night set in, a rescue operation involving two helicopters and three nearby vessels was scaling down but a naval diving unit remained on the scene with divers planning to continue the search, said Sophie Turner.
In the morning the helicopter will be back on the scene, Turner said, while warning it was unlikely the missing crew would survive until then in the cold sea waters.
It would be a search and recovery operation tomorrow not a search and rescue, she said.
The North Sea near Scotland sees heavy traffic from vessels supplying off shore oil rigs. Waters there are deadly cold this time of year, but weather in the area was described as good.
Sea rescue experts said crew in the water could survive for a few hours, but only if they were wearing survival suits designed to keep them warm.
Turner said it was not yet known why the boat capsized.
Residents of an eastern Chinese city attacked and injured nine people, including police officers and a reporter, who were investigating an illegal pyramid scheme, the official Xinhua news agency said.
One of the police officers was in critical condition after the attack, in Jiujiang city in the poor inland province of Jiangxi, Xinhua said in an overnight report.
About 100 members involved in the scheme attacked the investigators with iron bars as police were taking away the alleged organiser of the scheme, the report said.
The police detained more than 40 people who were accused of taking part in the attack, it added.
More than 100 policemen were called in to restore order, Xinhua said.
Austrian Interior Minister Liese Prokop, a former Olympic athlete, died suddenly late Sunday night at the age of 65.
Prokop's death was confirmed to the Austrian news agency by the ministry in Vienna shortly after midnight Monday.
She died from a rip in the aorta on the way to the hospital, ORF radio reported.
Prokop had served as minister under conservative chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel since December 2004.
Before her political career, Prokop was famed as an athlete, winning a silver medal in the pentathlon at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. 
In 1969 she set a world record in the sport with 5,352 points.
Somali Islamist fighters on Sunday retreated towards their last remaining stonghold of Kismayo in the face of a military onslaught by Ethiopian-backed government forces.
Earlier last year the Islamists took control of the capital Mogadishu and much of the country and were closing in on the weak transitional government's last stronghold at Baidoa.
But the intervention of Ethiopia's well-equipped armed forces  a move which has received tacit support from Washington  enabled the government to turn the tide and force the Islamists on the back foot.
After 10 days of heavy fighting involving Ethiopian artillery, tanks and aircraft the Islamists withdrew from the capital on Thursday.
Islamist leaders then regrouped in Kismayo and the nearby township of Jilib, but by Sunday the Islamists withdrew from Jilib, Islamist commanders told AFP.
We have retreated back from the town, Islamist commander Dahir Hashi told AFP. 
A resident told AFP he saw Islamist pick-up trucks mounted with machine guns speeding to Kismayo from the frontlines.
Somalia's deputy defence minister, Salad Ali Jelle, said the joint government and Ethiopian forces on the ground outnumbered the Islamists in Jilib by more than two to one.
The Islamists are very weak now, Jelle said.
In Mogadishu, Deputy Prime Minister Hussein Aidid, a former Mogadishu warlord, urged Islamist leaders to surrender, disarm and avoid more of the fighting that has killed hundreds, and possibly thousands, in the lawless African nation.
We will surround them but we will leave open (an opportunity) for dialogue and negotiations for them to disarm, Aidid told AFP.
So far, the offer of peace talks has fallen on deaf ears, with the Islamist leaders refusing to discuss surrender.
This is something that will never happen, said another of their  commanders, Sheikh Mohamed Ibrahim Bilal. 
Our country is under colonisation and we cannot accept any offer of negotiations as long as Ethiopians are in our territory.
Alarmed by the conflict, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki said late Sunday that he would convene an urgent regional summit in the new year as chairman of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) east African group of nations.
As a country we are also keen on experiencing regional peace and  stability. 
It is for this reason that I wish to appeal for peace in the Horn of Africa, Kibaki said in a New Year message.
The Islamists have sought to paint the presence of the Ethiopian military as a foreign invasion, while the government has responded by highlighting the Islamists' alleged links with Al-Qaeda.
Our joint forces are pursuing and chasing international terrorists. 
We will not stop until we have chased them completely from our country, Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi said.
He alleged that some of those accused of bombing the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as well as an Israeli-owned hotel in Kenya in 2002 were among the Islamists.
The Ethiopian intervention has received tacit US support, with Washington arguing that Addis Ababa had legitimate security concerns about the possibility of Islamists with Al-Qaeda links gaining control of the country.
African and Arab nations have called on the Ethiopian military to withdraw immediately, but the Somali government has insisted the troops will stay as long as they are needed.
Somalia disintegrated into lawlessness after the 1991 ousting of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. 
It was carved up among clan warlords, some of whom now back the government.
Thousands of Spaniards marched to protest the Madrid airport bombing by Basque separatists as the Ecuadorian community fretted over the fate of two missing men who if confirmed dead would be the first fatalities ascribed to armed group ETA since 2003.
Saturday's blast, which spectacularly ended a nine-month ceasefire by the armed separatist group and led the government to suspend efforts to broker a negotiated solution to four decades of conflict, slightly injured 19 people and left two young Ecuadorians missing.
Trained rescue dogs could find no trace of them Sunday but the search in the estimated 30,000 cubic meters (more than one million cubic feet) of rubble was to continue through the night.
The explosion was probably caused by a 500-plus kilogram bomb and possibly up to 800 kilograms of explosives, city hall experts said. 
A first police estimate had spoken of about 200 kilograms of explosives.
City hall also called off a planned light and sound extravaganza at the central Puerta del Sol square where Spaniards and tourists traditionally converge to welcome the new year.
ETA gave three telephone warnings in the hour before the blast but rescuers Sunday night still had no trace of either Diego Armando Estacio Civizapa (19) and Carlos Alonso Palate (33).
Both were believed to have been dozing in their cars waiting for flights from their homeland to arrive.
Diego's father, Winston, told Spanish television he could only pray for good news.
We're just waiting to see if they find anything, if they find him alive. 
I just pray to God they find him and that he is alright. That's all we can do, just hope.
As Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero pondered the apparent end of his attempts to kickstart long stalled peace negotiations, the mood was grim as several thousand people marched on Madrid's Sol Square to condemn the bombing.
Zapatero who found himself in the line of fire as some protesters yelled out for him to resign.
Other smaller rallies took place in a swathe of other towns.
Just one day before the bombing, Zapatero had forecast that the situation (with regards to ETA) will be better in a year.
But after the bombing the leader of the main conservative opposition Popular Party Mariano Rajoy urged a tougher stance.
The response cannot be 'I am suspending a negotiation', said Rajoy.
I am breaking with ETA, I am applying the law with all parties and all Spaniards and I am going to take the battle to them.
Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi on Monday ordered residents in the capital Mogadishu to hand in their weapons  within three days or face forceful disarmament.
In line with the declaration of transitional federal government in consultation with leaders, elders, civil society everybody has agreed on the disarmement process, Gedi told reporters. 
After that, the government has the support of Mogadishu to collect the weapons by use of force.
The Somali government offered on Monday to pardon any Islamist fighters who laid down arms after abandoning their final stronghold overnight.
The government is providing amnesty for them provided they hand over their weapons, Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi told a news conference in Mogadishu, saying the Islamist fighters had been misled by international terrorists.
Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi on Monday called for an urgent deployment of African Union peacekeepers after days of fierce fighting between the Ethiopia-backed government forces and an Islamist movement.
We are consulting with the African Union and the member states. 
They are still needed for their support in the pacification and stabilisation of the country. 
We would like the military observers and peacekeapers to come in to help us as soon as possible, Gedi told reporters in Mogadishu.
Israel began easing restrictions at checkpoints in the occupied West Bank Monday as promised by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at a summit with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas last month.
A military spokesman said roadblocks were not being lifted altogether for the time being.
These measures mainly concern an easing of severe checks at various crossing points and not, at this stage, the removal of military barriers, the spokesman said.
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat told AFP that Olmert promised Israel would begin lifting restrictions on some checkpoints Monday in a telephone call to Abbas the previous day.
But Erakat said that it was not possible to say if anything had changed yet.
We observe what Israel does and we will judge what we will see with our eyes, not what we hear from them, he told AFP.
The Israeli premier vowed to take immediate and concrete steps to improve humanitarian conditions for the Palestinians after his December 23 talks with Abbas  the two men's first meeting in six months.
Defence Minister Amir Peretz later told parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee that Israel would dismantle 59 of the 400 or so roadblocks in the West Bank in two phases  24 at first, and the rest later.
Palestinians travelling across the West Bank are forced daily to run the gauntlet of dozens of checkpoints erected by the Israeli army to control the movement of militants.
Followers of executed former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, were protesting at his execution in his home province of Tikrit Monday, witnesses said.
In Duluiyah, 100 kilometres north of Baghdad, dozens were demonstrating against the execution, according to the witnesses.
The former dictator, who ruled with an iron fist for 24 years before being ousted in 2003 in a US-led invasion, was hanged a day earlier in Baghdad for crimes against humanity in connection with the killings of 148 people in 1982 in the Iraqi Shiite town of Dujail.
The provincial capital of Tikrit, 170 kilometres north of Baghdad, where a curfew was imposed while the execution being carried out, was quiet, according to police.
Several hundred people had protested in Tikrit Sunday, but crowds dispersed soon after security forces fired shots in the air, police said.
Witnesses said Monday that supporters of Saddam had been trying to reach the grave of the former president, who was buried in his home village of Awja, five kilometres from Tikrit.
In other parts of the Tikrit province, supporters of Saddam were said to be meeting to consider what action to take.
Speakers were suggesting that Saddam's execution was an act of revenge by the Shiite-dominated government against the Sunnis, who were favoured during Saddam's regime.
The number of US troops who have died in Iraq has reached 3,000, according to a count kept by a casualty monitoring organization.
The announcement Sunday that a soldier had died after an improvised explosive device detonated near his patrol the day before increased the death count as 2006 draws to a close.
The group Iraq Coalition Casualty Count reports 2,989 deaths have been officially confirmed by the US Defence Department, and 11 additional deaths have not yet been officially confirmed.
US President George W Bush is reviewing the country's strategy in Iraq, amid growing public dissatisfaction with the war, the release of a highly anticipated study on Iraq, and losses by his centre-right Republican Party in congressional elections. Bush is expected to announce a new strategy in January.
An Agence France-Presse photographer, 50-year-old Peruvian national Jaime Razuri, was kidnapped in Gaza Monday by unknown gunmen, according to two witnesses.
Several unmasked gunmen abducted the photographer at the entrance to the agency's offices in the centre of Gaza City as he was returning from an assignment with a translator and a driver.
We got out of the jeep. 
I heard the noise of weapons. 
I turned around and I saw two unmasked men. 
They pointed their weapons at Jaime and at me, said the translator, Hamman Al Faghawi.
They told me to shut up and took him away in a Subaru car, he said.
There were two other armed men in the car who refused to identify themselves or to say what they wanted, the translator said.
Abductions of foreigners have been increasing in the past year in the Palestinian territories, especially in the volatile Gaza Strip.
Around 20 foreigners, including several journalists, have been kidnapped in recent months in Gaza. 
All were released soon after being abducted.
Bolivia has begun requiring visas of visitors from the United States effective Monday, the government announced.
The government of President Evo Morales announced the change after a cabinet meeting Sunday and Monday, noting that Bolivians traveling to the United States are required to obtain visas.
Even if Bolivia is a small country, one labelled underdeveloped, it still has dignity like any other country, Morales said.
Bolivians are currently charged a non-refundable 100 dollars to apply for visa to visit the United States, according to the US State Department's Bolivia embassy website.
Morales also announced a new decree supporting intensifying development of the country's Amazon region.
Somalia's Islamists fled towards Kenya or melted into the southern hills on Monday after abandoning their last stronghold to advancing government forces backed by Ethiopian troops, tanks and planes.
In just two weeks, Ethiopia's military muscle has enabled a feeble government to break out of its provincial enclave, drive the Somali Islamic Courts Council (SICC) from the capital and end six months of Islamist rule across much of the south. 
We need to end the impasse politically, Interior Minister Hussein Mohamed Farah Aideed told reporters in the capital. 
If we do not reconcile with them then they will start an insurgency like in Iraq. 
Several thousand of the Islamist fighters who retreated from Mogadishu on Thursday took a stand 300 km (186 miles) to the south near Kismayu port, but disappeared Sunday night after trading artillery fire with Ethiopian and government troops.
The leaders and fighters SICC, who fled Mogadishu on Thursday after six months rule, headed further south along the Indian Ocean coast towards neighbouring Kenya, residents said. 
They have vowed to hit back with guerrilla tactics. 
Some Kismayu residents said the Islamists headed into the remote hilly region of Buur Gaabo, just on the Somali side of the border, where it would be very hard to catch them. 
Aideed said SICC leaders were in the coastal village of Ras Kamboni.
It will take three to four months to clear them from there, he said That would be long. 
The place is rugged with thick bushes.
In the newly captured but gun-infested capital, the triumphant government gave residents and militia three days from Tuesday to hand in their weapons or be disarmed by force.
It renewed its appeal for African peacekeepers to come as soon as possible to help stabilise the Horn of Africa nation, which has been in chaos and without central rule since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.
And it urged Kenya to close its border and arrest any Islamists who made it across. 
A Kenyan police chief said several suspected fighters from Somalia were arrested on the frontier on Sunday and were being questioned. 
He gave no more details.
The long and porous border is tough to patrol, with ethnic Somalis populating the Kenyan side and nomads crossing easily.
U.S. warships from its Djibouti-based counterterrorism Joint Task Force were also said to be patrolling the sea off Somalia to stop SICC leaders or foreign militant supporters escaping.
Ivory Coast's northern-based New Forces rebels on Monday rejected a bid by President Laurent Gbagbo to bypass a U.N.-backed peace plan and hold direct talks with them.
Gbagbo announced his own plans on Dec. 19 to end the partition of the cocoa-growing country after a 20002/03 civil war, including direct talks with the rebels, in what was widely interpreted as a further snub to the U.N.-backed process.
But in a New Year's statement on Monday, New Forces leader Guillaume Soro made clear any talks would have to follow the process laid out by U.N. Security Council resolution 1721, adopted in November, which hands broad control of reunification and organising delayed elections to an interim prime minister.
Soro noted Gbagbo had asked President Blaise Compaore of neighbouring Burkina Faso to help mediate direct talks with the rebels, but said that contrary to some media reports, no such talks had taken place.
Nobody has the right to refuse dialogue and cooperation in the pursuit of peace. 
All the same, this dialogue can not be envisaged outside resolution 1721. 
So it seems to me to be urgent that all participate to fully enact this resolution, Soro said in a statement distributed by the rebels in Bouake.
Resolution 1721 approved a further 12-month delay to a presidential election originally due in October 2005 but postponed because the country was split into the rebel-held north and government-controlled south, as it still is.
The resolution also extended the term of interim consensus Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny, a central banker, and strengthened his powers to arrange disarmament of former fighters, a national identification campaign and other steps towards reunification and elections now due by Oct. 31, 2007.
The U.N. Security Council voiced grave concern on Dec. 21 at delays in the peace process and said Banny must be able to freely exercise his powers without hindrance, in an apparent swipe at Gbagbo and the home-grown peace plan he had launched two days earlier.
U.N. peacekeepers backed by forces from former colonial power France patrol a buffer zone between the two sides, but international mediation efforts have foundered amid bickering between Gbagbo's government, the rebels and political parties.
More than 2.5 million Muslim pilgrims performed final devil-stoning rites on Monday, as Saudi authorities declared the annual pilgrimage free from the tragedies that have marred haj in recent years.
Praise be to God, we have had a safe haj this year. 
I bring my sons with me normally (for protection), but this year I found I was okay without them, said Saadiya Mustafa from Egypt.
The organisation has been great, said Indian pilgrim Sayed Yousef, sitting on top of a van amid severe traffic congestion on the final day of haj. 
I was here two years ago, but this time there was more free food and less hassle.
On Monday, pilgrims made a third and final visit to the Jamarat Bridge to throw stones at three large walls representing the spot of Satan's temptation of biblical patriarch Abraham. 
Then many jumped on whatever transport they could find to make a final visit to Mecca's Grand Mosque, which filled with hundreds of thousands of pilgrims into the evening.
Look at the pedestrians, they are moving faster than the cars, said Hamdan bin Musaileh, a Yemeni stuck in the suffocating traffic jam. 
I bet they get a better reward from God for walking to the Mosque rather than taking transport.
Authorities congratulated themselves that the haj rites had passed off without incident despite a surge of pilgrims at the bridge on Monday in the rush to finish and leave.
There have been no security violations at all at the Jamarat area, Interior Minister Prince Nayef told reporters, praising Saudi clerics for offering pilgrims clear advice to pace the stoning throughout the day.
Hardliners of Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi school of Islam often insist stoning should take place in the afternoon to emulate to the word what they say was the practice of Prophet Mohammad.
It was on the final day of the last haj that 362 pilgrims were crushed to death during the stone-throwing ritual in the worst haj tragedy in 16 years. 
New construction work completed in recent months allows 250,000 pilgrims to pass over the Jamarat Bridge each hour. 
Saudi authorities were also bolder than normal in removing pilgrim squatters who set up makeshift tents in the area.
Saudi Arabia regularly deploys more than 50,000 security men to safeguard haj against militants and try to prevent disasters.
The 5-day rites were overshadowed by the hanging on Saturday of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, a hero to some Sunni Arabs over his anti-U.S. stances, but hated by many Shi'ites.
Saudi Arabia criticised Iraq for despoiling the spirit of the haj, one of the world's biggest displays of mass religious devotion which is a duty for able-bodied Muslims with the means.
A study of military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder found the more severe their anxiety, the greater their risk of heart disease, researchers said on Monday.
The link between stress and heart disease has long been recognized, and researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston found that relationship existed among nearly 2,000 Boston-area veterans.
Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, once dismissed as combat fatigue, can also afflict people who experience traumatic events. 
It is characterized by anxiety, reexperiences of the event and avoidance of stimuli related to the experience.
Based on commonly-used measures of stress disorder symptoms used in the Harvard study, each step up in symptom severity increased the risk of a heart attack by 26 percent, the report said.
This pattern of effects suggests that individuals with higher levels of (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms are not simply prone to reporting higher levels of chest pain or other physical symptoms but may well be at higher risk for developing coronary heart disease, wrote study author Laura Kubzansky in the Archives of General Psychiatry.
An unrelated study in the same journal from the Netherlands found veterans who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder were less sensitive to pain than counterparts without the disorder.
Twenty-four Dutch veterans were subjected to variable temperatures on their hands by researchers at Central Military Hospital and the Rudolph Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, Utrecht, led by Elbert Geuze. 
The 12 who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder rated the pain significantly less severe than those without the disorder.
Images taken of the veterans' brains during the temperature experiment showed those with the disorder processed the pain differently in regions of the brain associated with mood and cognition.
The year 2007 could deepen the wrinkles on Moloko Temo's face as she enters her 132nd year in life as the world's oldest living person.
South Africa's Tomo, who joined in the celebrations to usher in the new year with her great-great grand children today, officially turns 132 this July, according to a news report here.
Hailing from Limpopo province, Tomo is believed to be the oldest living person in the world though the Guinness Book of Records is yet to recognise the status, according to the national SAFM News.
She was born in 1874, it said.      
In her new year message, she urged the youth, especially her great-great-grand children to look after themselves. 
Former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was an avid reader, fed birds and told jokes while he was in US custody, an American military nurse who looked after him said in interviews with US media.
Robert Ellis (56), an operating room nurse assigned to Saddam during his US military detention, described a courteous, contemplative figure in stark contrast to the brutal reputation Saddam earned during his rule over Iraq.
He basically talked about his wife, and his children, Ellis told CNN on Monday.
He was an avid reader, loved to read and write. 
He had a lot of stories that he had written. 
He had a pamphlet that he wrote in every day and then when time came to visit him he'd read things to me, the army reservist said.
The master sergeant said he had strict orders to ensure Saddam stayed alive while in US hands.
That was my job 
To keep him alive and healthy, so they could kill him at a later date, Ellis recounted in an interview from his home in Normandy, Missouri with the St Louis Post-Dispatch published on Sunday.
Saddam was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed by hanging on Saturday, an end that did not sit well with Ellis.
I was kind of disappointed (by the execution), Ellis told CNN.
I thought that they would more or less put him in jail for the rest of his life to kind of stem some of the violence that I knew was going to take place, he said.
When Saddam at one point was allowed short walks outside
Saddam also watered a plot of weeds.
He said he was a farmer when he was young and he never forgot where he came from, Ellis told the paper.
Ellis said he did not believe Saddam was lonely while in detention because he was jovial at times.
Saddam had a good sense of humor. 
You know, made jokes, you know. 
And he spent most of his time reading, and praying, he said.
Ellis said he monitored Saddam's health from January 2004 to August 2004, 
Guards referred to Saddam by the code name Victor, he said.
Saddam went on a hunger strike at one point, refusing to eat when guards slid food through the slot on the bottom of his cell door. 
He visiting him twice a day, giving him medicine daily, checking his blood pressure and temperature and ensuring he was receiving enough food and water.
The former president would feed birds pieces of bread saved from his meals, the nurse told the St Louis newspaper. 
One hundred Malaysian soldiers arrived in Lebanon on Tuesday to join a U.N. peacekeeping force monitoring a truce between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
They are the first Malaysians to join the U.N. force, which was boosted under the terms of a U.N. Security Council resolution that ended Israel's 34-day war with Hezbollah in mid-August.
A military spokesman in Malaysia said a final contingent of 260 soldiers from the mainly Muslim country would follow on January 15.
Israel had initially objected to peacekeepers from countries that do not recognise the Jewish state, but later relaxed that stance.
Both Malaysia and neighbouring Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, have now sent troops to Lebanon, although neither has diplomatic ties with Israel.
U.N. resolution 1701 authorised an increase in the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) by more than 13,000 troops from its previous level of 2,000. 
There are now more than 11,000 UNIFIL peacekeepers in Lebanon, a spokesman said.
Malaysia's Defence Minister Najib Razak has said his country is ready to increase the number of troops in Lebanon if the United Nations extends the Malaysian mandate beyond six months.
The Malaysian soldiers will be based in the town of Marjayoun near the Syrian border, he said.
A British man accused of the serial murder of five prostitutes before Christmas appeared in court in the eastern town of Ipswich Tuesday.
Steve Wright, 48, was told by Ipswich Crown Court that he would be remanded in custody to May 1. 
A date for his trial has not yet been set.
The former truck driver was charged on December 21 with the murders of Gemma Adams
The five women were found dead near villages south of Ipswich during a 10-day period in December. 
They all worked as prostitutes in the market town near Cambridge.
Thousands of refugees fleeing recent fighting between the Ethiopia-backed Somali government and the now-vanquished Islamists  were stranded Tuesday at the border with Kenya after authorities refused them entry, officials said.
Around 4,000 Somalis are said to be in Dhobley along the Kenya-Somalia border, waiting, not yet able to cross, UN Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said in a statement.
Kenyan police said they would not allow the refugees into the country for security reasons.
We will never allow them to cross over, a top police commander in northeastern Kenya told AFP. 
If we allow them they will bring in security problems.
Kenya has reinforced its border security to prevent Islamists from crossing into the country, which already hosts at least 160,000 refugees who fled fighting more than 15 years of unrest in Somalia.
Police said they are probing eight suspected Islamists fighters who tried to infiltrate into the country after they lost control of their last stronghold in Kismayo to an allied Somali-Ethiopian force.
Despite government claims it has full control of southern and central Somalia, the Islamists, who have vowed to wage a guerrilla war, still pose a security threat in the impoverished nation of 10 million inhabitants.
The UN World Food Programme said it had resumed normal operations in Somalia after a two-week disruption was caused by a land, air and sea ban imposed by the Somali government.
Somalia has lacked an effective government since the 1991 ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.
Recurrent natural calamities have compounded misery for people in the country, where recent flooding affected about a million people.
An explosion in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya killed one Hamas activist and injured three others Tuesday, security officials said.
The three were carrying an explosive device or projectile, which accidentally fell and blew up, they said.
They were trying to secure an outpost of the auxiliary security force loyal to the ruling Palestinian movement against possible attacks by gunmen of the rival Fatah movement. 
A day after at least two people were injured and more than a dozen kidnapped in fresh clashes between the two groups.
Two huge Singapore-registered barges have been found, empty and abandoned, after mysteriously beaching on the Malaysian coast, a report said Tuesday.
Villagers spotted the barges as they approached off the coast of eastern Pahang state in rough seas on Sunday, the New Straits Times said.
I thought they may be mysterious islands which had surfaced unnaturally from the bottom of the sea, said villager Ismail Mat Taib, who had been herding cattle near the beach.
When they settled on the sand, the villagers discovered they were barges each the length of two football fields, and three storeys high.
A police spokesman told the daily that they were trying to trace the owner of the vessels, which had Singapore markings.
The Spanish government has broken off peace talks with the armed Basque separatist group ETA after it planted a car bomb at Madrid airport, probably killing two people, the governing Socialist Party confirmed Tuesday.
There is no dialogue with violence, Socialist organizational secretary Jose Blanco said, stressing that it was ETA that had ended the peace process.
There had been uncertainty about the state of the peace process after Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said he had suspended contacts with ETA.
The process had only resulted in one official meeting between the government and ETA since the group declared a ceasefire in March and Zapatero announced talks in late June.
The rupture was a heavy blow to millions of Basques and other Spaniards, who had hoped for an end to a violent campaign of nearly four decades that has claimed more than 800 lives.
Some analysts thought Saturday's attack may have been carried out by a splinter group within ETA, while some sources within ETA's political wing Batasuna said ETA may only have wanted to pressure the government into making concessions rather than to end the peace process.
The daily El Mundo, however, said ETA had staged the bombing in knowledge of the government's intention to move some jailed ETA activists to prisons closer to their homes in a concession demanded by the separatists.
Firefighters meanwhile continued combing thousands of tons of rubble produced by the explosion of a bomb weighing up to 800 kilos at a parking lot of the airport's new terminal 4.
They reached the zone where the bomb had gone off, but discovered no sign of the two Ecuadorian men who had gone missing. 
Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said there was virtually no hope of finding them alive.
The explosion destroyed or damaged more than 1,000 cars. 
The damage was estimated at up to 40 million euros (53 million dollars).
ETA had not staged fatal attacks since May 2003. 
The group seeks a sovereign Basque state carved out of northern Spain and southern France.
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh received Tuesday a message from the family of Saddam Hussein in which they voiced gratitude for his  position against the execution of the former Iraqi president.
On the behest of the family of the martyr president of the Republic of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, we express thanks and appreciation for your brotherly and generous position, read the message, quoted by Yemen's official Saba news agency.
The message was signed by three of Saddam's nephews. 
Taha Abdullah al-Hajj, Muhammad Hassan al-Majid and Jassim Hassan al-Majid, who have been living in exile in Yemen since Saddam's regime was toppled by a US-led invasion in 2003.
Yemen had on Friday called on US President George W Bush to prevent the execution of Saddam, saying such a move could set off more violence in Iraq.
The former Iraqi leader was executed early Saturday morning in Baghdad four days after an Iraqi court upheld the death sentence handed down after Saddam was convicted for the 1982 massacre in the Iraqi city of Dujail.
On Tuesday, hundreds of people performed special prayers for Saddam in the Yemeni capital Sana'a before they took to the street to protest his execution, shouting slogans against the United States and the Shiite-dominated government in Iraq.
They also waved anti-US placards, with one reading, If Saddam is martyred, every one of us is Saddam.
Saleh's nephew, Yahya Muhammad Abdullah Saleh attended the prayers.
Yemen angered its Arab Gulf neighbours for its public opposition to the intervention by foreign military forces to end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
Russia on Tuesday assumed the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council, the world body's most powerful organ, which has five new elected members.
The 15-nation council has five permanent members with veto power -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- and 10 elected nations, who rotate for two-year terms, five each year.
South Africa, Indonesia, Italy, Belgium and Panama took their seats as nonpermanent members, replacing Argentina, Tanzania, Japan, Denmark and Greece. 
Panama was the compromise candidate for Latin America after a protracted battle between Venezuela and Guatemala last year.
Remaining for another year on the council, whose decisions on peace and security are mandatory for all U.N. members, are Congo Republic, Ghana, Peru, Qatar and Slovakia.
The council presidency rotates monthly, according to the English alphabet, with Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, taking over for January from Qatari Nassir Abdulaziz al-Nasser.
But campaigns to enlarge the council, whose permanent members are World War Two victors, have met with resistance over the last decade, despite nearly universal agreement that the body is dominated by industrial nations and omits such countries as Japan and Germany, the highest dues payers after the United States.
But each candidate for possible enlargement has had enough opposition to sink the attempt.
Comic actor Will Ferrell and his wife have had their second baby boy, Ferrell's representative said on Tuesday.
Mattias Ferrell was born in the early hours on Saturday in Los Angeles, according to a statement from his publicist Matt Labov.
All are healthy, happy and otherwise okay, Labov said.
Ferrell and his wife Viveca have one other boy, 2 year-old Magnus.
Ferrell shot to stardom on television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, and the funnyman has risen to become a major Hollywood star in such movies as Elf.
Their May-December romance has lasted longer than many a Hollywood marriage, and now actress Demi Moore, 44, tells Vanity Fair magazine that she and husband Ashton Kutcher, 28, are considering having kids.
Most definitely, she told the widely-read magazine in its February issue that hit newsstands in New York and Los Angeles on Tuesday.
Once you hit three, where you're outnumbered, it's really, like, 'What's the difference between (three or) four or five,' she said.
Moore, the star of movies such as G.I. Jane, Ghost and Indecent Proposal, already has three children ages 18, 15 and 13 with former husband, actor Bruce Willis. 
She and Willis divorced in 2000.
Moore and Kutcher, who gained fame on television's That '70s Show, met in 2003 and married two years later. 
While many Hollywood watchers first took bets on how long they would last, the pair seem to have forged a special bond.
The actress told Vanity Fair that being married to Kutcher is the best thing that has happened to her.
If somebody would have said, 'O.K., here is the prediction: You're going to meet a man 25 years-old, and he's going to see being with you and having your three children as a bonus,' I would have said, 'Keep dreaming,' Moore said.
I think it caught us both by surprise, particularly him, she said later. 
The magazine said Moore's kids now call Kutcher MOD for My Other Dad.
Adding that for us, the age was never even a thought because it was really just like meeting somebody I've always known.
United Nations staff and peacekeepers in the south of Sudan have been accused of sexually abusing children as young as 12, the Daily Telegraph reported Wednesday.
The abuse allegedly started when the UN, which has around 10,000 personnel in the area, moved in two years ago to help reconstruction after a 23-year civil war, the paper said.
Initial claims of abuse emerged within months of the UN's arrival and an internal report was reportedly compiled on the issue in 2005.
The UN, whose new Secretary General Ban Ki-moon started work Tuesday, has refused to comment on the allegations, according to the Telegraph.
The paper said it has gathered accounts from more than 20 victims detailing claims that UN workers have picked up children in vehicles owned by the organisation and forced them to have sex.
But the Telegraph said that hundreds of children may have been abused.
The Sudanese government, which is against any UN deployment in the stricken Darfur region of western Sudan, has also gathered evidence including footage of UN workers having sex with three young girls, the paper said.
James Ellery, the British regional co-ordinator for the UN mission in Sudan, has refuted the claims, according to an interview last May cited by the Telegraph.
None of these claims can be substantiated. 
Over 90 percent of people here are illiterate and rumours therefore spread very quickly, he was quoted as saying.
This is the most backward country in Africa and there are lots of misunderstandings as to the UN's role.
Australia appears to be suffering an accelerated Greenhouse effect, with the pace of global warming faster across the country than in other parts of the world, climatologists said on Wednesday.
The world's driest inhabited continent, already suffering one of its worst droughts, was waging its own unique climate war, said Australia's Bureau of Meteorology yearly climate report.
Half the country was desperate for water and the other half was awash with a year's rainfall for the entire continent.
Most scientists agree this is part of an enhanced Greenhouse effect, bureau senior climatologist Neil Plummer told Reuters.
Temperatures are actually rising a little bit faster over Australia compared to the global average, and we know that of Australia's 20 hottest years, 15 have occurred since 1980.   
As the first cyclone of the summer bore down on Australia's orthwest coast, bringing more rain and potentially destructive winds, the report revealed extraordinary climatic contrasts.
Some areas experienced rare summer snow falls over Christmas to dampen bushfires, even as the drought tightened its grip and major cities imposed tough restrictions on water usage.
While the nation received above average 2006 rains, with 490 mm of rain falling against the 472 mm average, key water catchments and rivers shrivelled in the food bowl southeast where most Australians live.
Rain fell, but just not in the most populated areas. 
Most Australians would certainly have seen 2006 as a dry year, Plummer said.
Australia's average temperature for 2006 was 0.47 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) above the long-term average, but it was only the eleventh warmest year since 1910, the bureau report said.
And despite record daily temperatures in the southeast, last year was cooler than 2005 due to a very active tropical wet season early in the year.
Plummer said an El Nino weather event in the Pacific Ocean bringing severe drought to eastern Australia was responsible for much of the variation, but that was beginning to weaken.
What we see on the rainfall is a signature of El Nino. 
There are signs that is weakening and most times we see a breakdown in late summer or autumn, and usually a good break with lots of rain.
US President George W. Bush will welcome congressional leaders of both major US parties Wednesday for talks on a range of issues including Iraq, an administration official said Tuesday.
Tomorrow evening is a reception and will be more informal in nature. 
I'd expect a range of topics about the year ahead to be discussed among the group, including Iraq, the official said on condition of anonymity.
The embattled president, under pressure to change course in Iraq, has been holding consultations ahead of a speech in which he is expected to unveil a new strategy for quelling deadly violence tearing that country apart.
The speech is expected to come before Bush's annual State of the Union address in late January, and could be as early as next week.
Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said in an interview published Tuesday he wished his tenure was already over, and made clear he had no desire for a second spell in office.
Maliki, accused by US critics of failing to clamp down on sectarian militia partly responsible for raging violence in Iraq, was asked in an interview with the Wall Street Journal whether he would accept a second term.
Impossible, Maliki answered.
I wish I could be done with it even before the end of this term.
I would like to serve my people from outside the circle of senior officials, maybe through the parliament or through working directly with the people, he added.
I didn't want to take this position. 
I only agreed because I thought it would serve the national interest, and I will not accept it again.
Maliki also said that each of the seven months he had been in office had been difficult because of political divisions wracking Iraq.
But despite his travails, Maliki said he would not be in office, unless he thought the dire plight of Iraq could improve, and he was asked if he thought Iraq would have peace in his lifetime.
I have a strong hope. 
If I didn't have hope, I wouldn't be here today, he told the Journal.
Maliki's four-year government took office in March last year, and his cabinet was installed and approved in May. 
Given Iraq's volatile environment and fast-moving political developments, it is unclear whether his government will serve out its full term.
Two men were killed and two other people injured in a two-vehicle collision on the Chuo Expressway in Ena, Gifu Prefecture, police said Wednesday.
The police said they are trying to identify the two men, who were riding in a car which hit the median before colliding with a van driven by Yasushi Takayanagi, of Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, at around 9 p.m.
Takayanagi, 36, and his wife Masako, 35, suffered minor injuries, the police said.
The collision temporarily shut down southbound traffic between Ena and Mizunami Interchange, the police said. 
Meanwhile, a heavy fog in Yamagata Prefecture in northeastern Japan on Wednesday delayed the Tsubasa No. 102 bound for Tokyo from Shinjo and six other Yamagata Shinkansen trains by up to 33 minutes, affecting some 2,400 holiday travelers, East Japan Railway Co. officials said.
JR East's Yamagata branch said the fog developed between Shinjo and Yonezawa on the JR Ou Line, forcing the seven trains to run at reduced speeds.
The government is set to drop its plan to review imperial succession rules that bar women from succeeding to the throne, given the birth last year of the first boy in 41 years to the world's oldest hereditary monarchy, the Sankei Shimbun reported Wednesday.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is paying little attention to a proposal that a government panel made in 2005 that included a recommendation to revise the Imperial House Law in order to give priority to firstborns, regardless of gender, the national daily said.
But the newspaper also said the government will continue necessary discussions on whether Japan can maintain a stable imperial succession relying only on the births of male heirs.
The panel, organized under the initiative of Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, to study ways to ensure a stable succession, was seen as paving the way for Princess Aiko, 5, the only child of Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako, to ascend the throne.
The Imperial House Law, enacted in 1947, stipulates that only male heirs who have emperors on their father's side can ascend the imperial throne.
The Sankei said that the situation changed after Princess Kiko gave birth to a boy in September.
The boy, named Prince Hisahito, is now third in line to the throne, following Crown Prince Naruhito, 46, his uncle, and his father Prince Akishino, 41.
North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun has died, the North's official media reported on Wednesday.
Paek, 77, who had served as foreign minister since September 1998, had been ill. His last major appearance on the public stage was at an Asian foreign ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July.
Palestinian security officials advised European and American nationals to leave Gaza Wednesday because of a threat of kidnappings, a top official said, two days after the abduction of an AFP photographer who remains missing in the impoverished territory.
We've had warnings of kidnapping operations and have asked American and European nationals to leave Gaza, a security source told AFP.
A man was rescued Wednesday, two days after falling 300 metres while climbing Mount Fuji, considered a holy mountain in Japan.
Fumio Shoji, 33, who had a pelvis fracture and frostbite, spent two nights in a snow cave awaiting rescue, Kyodo press agency reported. 
He had wanted to celebrate New Year's Day on top of Japan's highest mountain. 
On Monday, one man died and two others were injured after they slipped down the face of the 3,776-metre-high Mount Fuji.
Rescue efforts had been obstructed by bad weather. 
It said they had also been in contact with a third man linked to the March 11 bombings which killed 191 people.
In the raids, police seized false documents, receipts for telephone calls to Afghanistan, cash and three computers.
Britain's Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott on Tuesday condemned the leaked video footage shot on a cellphone of Saddam Hussein's execution as totally unacceptable.
Speaking to BBC radio, Prescott said, I think the manner was quite deplorable really. 
I don't think one can endorse in any way that, whatever your views about capital punishment.
Frankly, to get the kind of recorded messages coming out is totally unacceptable and I think whoever is involved and responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves, he continued.
The deputy premier's comments came as the Iraqi government launched an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the execution of the former Iraqi leader, who was hanged before dawn on Saturday in Baghdad.
Prescott has been left at the political helm while Prime Minister Tony Blair is out of the country on a family holiday. But the government reiterated that it was Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett's comments made Saturday that represent the views of the government on Saddam's death.
I welcome the fact that Saddam Hussein has been tried by an Iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the Iraqi people. 
He has now been held to account, Beckett said in a statement after the execution.
The Iraqi authorities have expressed worry that the secret footage, which features the taunting of Saddam as well as his execution, will contribute to a dramatic rise in sectarian tensions between Iraq's Sunni and Shiite communities.
A group of Australian federal parliamentarians across the political spectrum wants the US government to let them visit Australian terrorist suspect David Hicks at Guantanamo Bay, media reports said Wednesday.
As the fifth anniversary of Hicks's detention at the US military base in Cuba nears, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja argued that similar delegations from other countries had visited the facility and it was time Australia was allowed to have one, too.
Hicks had pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy, attempted murder and aiding the enemy, but those charges were dropped after the US Supreme Court ruled in June that the military tribunals set up to try Hicks and other Guantanamo Bay inmates were illegal.
Hicks's military-appointed lawyer Major Michael Mori has indicated his client would again plead not guilty when charges were relaid.
The Australian government has consistently supported US efforts to charge Hicks, but pressure has been building on Canberra to take action to end Hicks's detention.
Earlier in the week, the new Australian director of military prosecutions, Brigadier Lyn McDade, said the treatment of Hicks was abominable, and Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said those remarks reflected the government's position.
His agreement with McDade marked a change in the government's rhetoric about Hicks.
The fact that a trial has not yet occurred frustrates us, and we have been arguing very strongly with the United States that these issues need to be resolved, Ruddock said.
Kenya's government has closed the border with Somalia to stop armed people crossing into the country with refugees, Foreign Affairs Minister Raphael Tuju said Wednesday.
The Kenya-Somalia border is closed, Tuju told a news briefing in Nairobi, hours after security forces deported at least 600 refugees back to the lawless neighbouring African nation in a move that alarmed the UN refugee agency.
On Monday, the Somali transitional government appealed to Nairobi to shut its border to prevent Islamists who had just abandoned their last remaining stronghold in the port town of Kismayo from crossing over.
Tuju said Kenya's government, which has reinforced aerial and ground patrols along the 700-kilometre border, feared a possible influx of arms into the country, brought by fleeing refugees and combatants.
He said civilians faced no danger in Somalia, where government fighters backed by Ethiopian forces vanquished the Islamist movement from all its urban strongholds in a military campaign less than two weeks long.
There is no evidence that anybody who is not a combatant is in danger, he said.
Earlier, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) agency had protested that Nairobi's deportations violated international law.
We are certainly disturbed by reports we are getting that people seeking asylum are being sent back because this amounts to contravention of the international humanitarian law, said Millicent Mutuli, the UNHCR spokeswoman in Nairobi.
Tuju said the agency would set up camps inside Somalia if it sees need to do so.
The UNHCR has provisions ... to set up camps anywhere, inside Somalia, Tuju said.
Afghan and foreign troops killed 20 rebels, including two commanders, in operations against militants in southern Afghanistan, officials said Wednesday.
Seventeen, including the commanders, were killed in the southern province of Helmand in a three-day operation that wrapped up Monday and involved Afghan and NATO-led troops, interior ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP.
About 4,500 British troops are in Helmand serving with NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
An ISAF spokesman in the capital, Kabul, confirmed there had been sporadic incidents in the area, but could not confirm the interior ministry's death toll.
Provincial police chief, general Mohammad Nabi Mullahkhail, said two Taliban pickup trucks were destroyed in the operation in and around the province's Kajaki district.
British troops make up the second-largest contingent in the 37-nation ISAF, after the United States.
The separate US-led coalition focused on counterterrorism operations said its troops had called in an air strike on Monday against insurgents seen planting improvised bombs in Uruzgan province, also in the south.
Three were killed, it said. 
Uruzgan is the base of most of the 2,200 Dutch troops in ISAF.
The onset of winter has seen a drop in Taliban-linked violence, which soared to new heights last year. 
Most of the unrest was in the south, the heartland of the militia that was in government from 1996 to 2001.
The fighting killed about 4,000 people in 2006 -- most of them rebels.
Three Palestinian gunmen and a civilian were killed Wednesday, as clashes between the rival Fatah and Hamas movements flared up again in Gaza and foreigners were told to leave the volatile strip for fear of abductions.
The latest fighting began when a sniper gunned down a Fatah member as he was guarding the house of a senior militant in the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya.
The family of the slain accused Hamas militants of being behind the shooting and responded by opening fire at Hamas supporters leaving a mosque.
A 22-year-old woman critically injured in the head during the exchange of fire died of her wounds, hospital officials announced.
Later in the day, members of a Hamas-controlled security force launched rocket-propelled grenades at the car of a Fatah official in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, killing two Fatah members.
Three others were wounded, one of them critically, security sources said.
The latest clashes come despite a fragile, two-week-old truce, which Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Ismail Haniya had hoped would end the wave of internal violence that began December 11 with the shooting of the three small children of a senior Fatah official in Gaza City.
Supporters of Abbas's opposition Fatah and Haniya's ruling Hamas also continued to exchange mutual kidnappings Wednesday, with local reports saying gunmen snatched three nephews of a senior Fatah official in northern Gaza.
A foreign photographer, 50-year-old Jaime Razuri from Peru, snatched by unknown militants in front of the French news agency AFP's Gaza office Monday night, also remained missing.
Police said they had as yet no clue who was behind the abduction.
The security services answering to Abbas urged foreigners to leave the Gaza Strip for fear of further abductions.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Wednesday expressed condolences for the death of North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, who had been involved in reunification talks with South Korea.
Ban, a former foreign minister of South Korea, said he worked with Paek for peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula over the years.
Ban said he hopes the death of Foreign Minister Paek does not, in any case, hinder the ongoing six-party process or the way for North Korea's foreign policy to open up to the international community.
Since he was elected to the top UN leadership position, Ban has been saying that he wants to help resolve the conflict over North Korea's nuclear dispute with the UN Security Council, which has imposed targeted nuclear technology on the Pyongyang regime for pushing its nuclear ambitions.
The six-party talks to end the nuclear dispute have not been successful as North Korea rejected demands to abandon its nuclear programmes. 
The talks involved China, Russia, the two Koreas, the US and Japan.
Tunisian security forces shot dead 25 members of a criminal gang south of the capital Tunis on Wednesday, a security source said.
Twenty-five people were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in the town of Slimane, the source said. 
Slimane is 30 km south of Tunis. 
Government officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the report.
Major opposition parties in Bangladesh declared Wednesday that they would boycott the upcoming general election, a move that pushed the impoverished south Asian country towards political uncertainty.
The decision to stay away from the January 22 parliamentary polls was taken at a joint meeting of a 14-party combine led by former premier Sheikh Hasina and half a dozen other groups.
The conflicts among major political parties are ruining its political stability, said leading economist Waheeduddin Mahmud.
Other analysts feared the continuing standoff could jeopardize the country's fragile democracy.
The opposition also announced a 48-hour blockade of the capital Dhaka on January 7 and 8 by party activists and supporters demanding the resignation of President Iajuddin Ahmad from his dual office of the chief executive of the caretaker government.
Ahmad was accused of helping outgoing prime minister and chief of Nationalist-Islamist alliance Khaleda Zia and demanded his resignation for ignoring his obligation to remain neutral during the election.
The announcement on boycotting the election was made by opposition supremo Hasina at a news conference.
The opposition parties also called for updating the existing voters' list before holding polls.
Gerald Ford, remembered as a humble man who healed a nation traumatized by the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War, was buried Wednesday on a hill next to his presidential museum as the setting sun glistened on the river below. 
In an intimate service ahead of his burial in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ford was remembered as a man who chose patriotism over politics, bipartisanship over bitterness, service over self-aggrandizement.
For myself and for our nation I want to thank my predecessor for all he did to heal our land, former president Jimmy Carter told mourners, repeating the opening line of his inaugural address.
Ford died in California on December 26, at the age of 93. 
Ford served for just 29 months as president after Richard Nixon resigned under the threat of indictment in August 1974. 
Ford, who declared upon taking office that our long national nightmare is over, is chiefly remembered for his controversial pardon for any crimes Nixon may have committed in the White House coverup of an illegal Republican spying operation against the Democratic Party in the Watergate building in 1972.
The decision sparked outrage at the time, but commentators have since said it allowed the United States to move on from the scandal.
Ford paid a heavy political price for the pardon, losing the 1976 presidential election to Carter, who promised a new era of clean politics.
While his presidency was also marred by the humiliating retreat of US troops after the fall of Saigon, Ford's tenure has been widely praised as a pivotal turning point in American history.
Because Gerald Ford was there to restore the strength of the presidency, to rebuild our defenses and to demonstrate firmness and clarity, America could again, in Lincoln's words, stand as the last best hope of Earth, Donald Rumsfeld, who served as Ford's chief of staff and secretary of defense, told mourners.
He reminded Americans of who they were and he put us on the right path when the way ahead was, at best, uncertain.
Ford served for 25 years in the US House of Representatives until Nixon asked him to be vice president after the previous vice president, Spiro Agnew, resigned over a corruption scandal.
For people who suffer from winter depression triggered largely by reduced sunlight, a bedside device that simulates the rising of the sun may provide relief, a study shows. 
Negative air ionization, also delivered at the bedside, seems to be effective as well.
Dawn simulation and negative air ionization are two naturalistic, non-pharmaceutical environmental enhancements now verified superior to placebo and remarkably effective in the treatment of winter depression, Dr. Michael Terman told Reuters Health.
In the study, dawn simulation and negative air ionization, both activated toward the end of sleep, proved to be as effective as bright light therapy after waking up -- an established treatment for winter depression, also known as seasonal affective disorder or SAD.
With bright light therapy, SAD sufferers sit at a bright light box for 30 minutes at breakfast time. Dawn simulation and negative air ionization are more convenient, being delivered automatically and innocuously during the final hours of sleep by an apparatus placed next to the bed.
In their study, Dr. Michael Terman and Dr. Jiuan Su Terman of Columbia University in New York randomly assigned 99 adults with SAD to one of five treatments: dawn simulation equivalent to that May in northern temperate latitudes; a brief dawn pulse; bright light after waking; high flow rate negative air ionization; or low flow rate ionization
Improvement was seen in 57 percent of subjects in the bright light therapy, 50 percent of those in the dawn simulation group and 48 percent in the high air ionization group. By contrast, improvement was seen in just 23 percent of those who got low ionization and in 43 percent of subjects in the sunrise pulse group.
Although the sunrise pulse treatment was therapeutically active in some patients, it led to the persistence, emergence and exacerbation of depressive symptoms, making it an unfavorable option, the Termans write.
Summing up, Michael Terman said while morning bright light therapy remains the first-line intervention for SAD, with thousands of successes and satisfied patients, dawn simulation and negative air ionization may also be considered as options.
If you think you may suffer from winter depression, Terman suggests, as a first step, completing the Personalized Inventory for Depression and SAD survey, a free and confidential online self-assessment questionnaire posted on the nonprofit website of the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, www.cet.org.
The site also includes more detailed description of light and ion therapy.
A party seen by Spain's government as the political wing of Basque guerrillas ETA said on Wednesday it was caught by surprise by Saturday's deadly car bomb, which led the government to end the country's peace process.
Rescue workers at Madrid Airport on Wednesday found the body of one of the two Ecuadorean immigrants believed to have been sleeping in their cars at the time of the blast, which injured another 19 people.
It was the first ETA attack to claim a life for more than three years and ended a nine-month ceasefire.
I don't think anyone expected an attack like the one in Madrid, Joseba Alvarez, a leading member of Batasuna, told Basque radio in a remark which some might interpret as signalling divisions within the region's independence movement.
The government broke off attempts at dialogue with ETA after the car bomb, which wrecked a multi-storey car park at the capital's international airport.
The Interior Ministry said 35-year-old Carlos Alonso Palate had been found in his car covered by a blanket.
Justice will be done, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said after meeting with the families of the victims on Wednesday. 
The people who committed this awful crime will be brought to justice.
Speaking to reporters, Zapatero said the airport bomb was not only a crime but was, completely useless as far as any objective the terrorist group may have.
The Spanish government sees Batasuna as ETA's political wing. 
The banned party refuses either to admit to links with the guerrillas or to condemn its attacks, in which more than 800 people have been killed in four decades of separatist struggle.
A split between Batasuna and ETA could further complicate attempts to negotiate a solution to the Basque conflict, which began in the final phase of the Franco dictatorship when the region's distinctive language and culture were suppressed.
ETA has not claimed responsibility for the attack, although the government said that one of three warning calls received in the hour before the blast claimed to be from the guerrillas.
Before the airport blast, the last ETA killings had been in May 2003 when a car bomb killed two policemen in the northern Spanish town of Sanguesa.
Batasuna had warned for months of a crisis in the peace process that Zapatero began in June.
Batasuna wants to be legalised again, as well as demanding police ease pressure on Basque nationalists and that ETA prisoners be transferred to jails closer to the Basque Country.
About one in seven Basques support Batasuna, polls show.
Five Palestinians, including a 21-year-old woman, were killed Wednesday in Gaza as simmering factional tensions boiled over in the volatile coastal strip, medics and security sources said.
The clashes were the deadliest since December 19, when president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party and the ruling Islamist Hamas faction agreed to a ceasefire after four days of internecine violence killed 15 people and wounded dozens more in the Gaza Strip.
Late Wednesday, Palestinian sources said the two sides had agreed to restore calm in the southern town of Khan Yunis where the violence had been centered.
They agreed to free their respective hostages, including Mootaz al-Tawil, the local deputy chief of the preventative security force loyal to Fatah whose capture led to clashes in which three of the force's members were killed. 
Palestinian security sources confirmed that Tawil had been released.
Earlier, security forces had come under fire while trying to free Tawil, wounding several of them and again while trying to take the injured to hospital.
Two men were killed instantly and one died of his injuries in hospital a short while later, medics said. 
Four others were wounded in the clash, medics and security sources said.
In the northern town of Jabaliya, a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militant group loosely affiliated with Fatah, was shot as he left his house.
Shortly afterward, clashes between Fatah and Hamas erupted in the town, wounding at least 10 people. 
A 21-year-old woman later died in hospital as a result of her wounds, medics said.
Wednesday's violence followed a series of tit-for-tat abductions in northern Gaza between Hamas and Fatah.
Tensions between the two rival factions exploded into street fighting in Gaza on December 16, when Abbas announced that he would call early presidential and parliamentary elections to resolve a months-old standoff with the ruling Islamists.
Hamas condemned the move as a coup and vowed to fight the measure.
In all, at least 21 Palestinians have been killed in the internecine violence since Abbas's call for early polls.
The moderate Palestinian president said early elections were the only way to resolve months of stalemate with Hamas over forming a government of national unity, which it is hoped will help lift a debilitating Western aid freeze.
The West, which considers Hamas a terrorist organization, suspended all direct aid to the Palestinian government after the Islamists formed a cabinet in March, demanding that the movement renounce violence and recognize Israel and past peace deals.
Talks between Fatah and Hamas over forming a coalition cabinet collapsed over Hamas's steadfast refusal to bend to Western demands and over distribution of key ministries.
Seventy-nine Indian Maoist rebels have surrendered to authorities in the insurgency-racked central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, police said Thursday.
The Maoists laid down their arms at a ceremony at police headquarters in Raipur, capital of Chhattisgarh, one of the Indian states worst hit by the leftist insurgency and home to many of India's indigenous people, or adivasis.
Chief Minister Raman Singh said the surrender late Wednesday was part of a new state government surrender policy aimed at bringing Maoists back into the political mainstream, and called it a major success in tacking the insurgency.
Some 356 people -- security personnel, civilians and Maoists -- died in 2006 in insurgency-related violence in mineral-rich Chhattisgarh, one of 15 out of India's 29 states where the rebels are active, according to official figures.
The Maoists, who say they are fighting for the rights of neglected tribes and landless farmers, have gained control of 10 of the state's 16 impoverished districts.
About 50,000 villagers have been displaced in the state, living in tent shelters as Indian counter-insurgency forces operate in the countryside.
Last year, India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described the Maoists as the single biggest threat to the nation's internal security.
The Iraqi government has not set a date for the execution of Saddam Hussein's two co-defendants, including his half brother, an aide to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said on Thursday.
Barzan al-Tikriti, Saddam's half brother and former intelligence chief, and Awad al-Bander, a former chief judge, were found guilty along with Saddam of crimes against humanity in the killings of 148 Shi'ite men from Dujail in the 1980s.
Saddam was hanged on Saturday.
A Hong Kong father who punished his son by forcing him to parade naked twice in public has been ordered by a court to live in a shelter and to undergo counselling before returning to the family home, a news report said Thursday.
The 46-year-old father dealt out the punishment first when his son, aged 10, failed to do his homework and then a second time when the boy had argued and pushed over his younger brother.
He appeared in court Wednesday for sentencing after earlier pleading guilty to ill-treating a child, said the report in the Hong Kong Standard.
The court heard that on the first occasion in October 2005, the  father forced his son to march naked through the streets for 10 minutes. 
The boy's mother reported the incident to the police. 
The father pleaded guilty to child abuse at a hearing in October 2006 and was bound over to keep good behaviour for two years.
However, just weeks after his court appearance he dealt the same punishment again, dragging the naked boy from the bath and forcing him to take an elevator downstairs after a row with his 3-year-old brother.
Sentencing him on Wednesday to 18 months probation, magistrate Kwok Wai-kin told the father that, while his intentions were respectable, his parenting methods were wrong and amounted to mental abuse.
Your behaviour is completely unacceptable, said Kwok, You have severely humiliated your son. 
Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels detonated a mine in northern Sri Lanka on Thursday, killing a soldier and wounding two, the military said.
Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe said troops were clearing a stretch of road in Vavuniya town when the blast occurred.
Fragmentation mine explosions have increased in recent weeks, as fighting intensifies between the military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the east of the island.
More than 3,000 people were killed in ambushes, suicide bombings and clashes last year and international truce monitors say a 2002 ceasefire now exists only on paper.
Taliban chief Mullah Mohammad Omar has added to the mystery over Osama bin Laden, saying he had not seen his ally and fellow fugitive since U.S.-backed forces ousted the Taliban from Afghanistan in late 2001.
No, I have neither seen him, nor have I made any effort to do so, but I pray for his health and safety, Omar said in an e-mailed response to questions sent by Reuters.
The questions were relayed to Omar through his spokesman Mohammad Hanif, and a reply was received late on Wednesday.
A half-dozen audio tapes of bin Laden were circulated during the first half of 2006, but the al Qaeda leader last appeared on video tape in late 2004, while tapes of his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, have been issued regularly.
A video tape of bin Laden was released late last year, but it was identified as old footage, and the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States passed without any word from the al Qaeda leader.
Speculation over the whereabouts and health of bin Laden boiled over in September when a French provincial newspaper reported that he had died of typhoid in late August.
Though several governments and intelligence agencies rebutted that report, saying they had no evidence to suggest bin Laden had died, nor did they have any clue to where he was.
The wealthy Saudi-born bin Laden helped bankroll the Taliban after moving to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, and he reportedly married one of Omar's daughters to cement their alliance.
The best guess to bin Laden's whereabouts remains somewhere on the rugged border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, in the ethnic tribal lands where Omar's Taliban counts on support to fight an insurgency against U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan and the government of President Hamid Karzai.
Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, both major U.S. allies in the war on terrorism, have deteriorated sharply over the past year in the wake of the bloodiest campaign mounted by the Taliban since it was ousted from power.
To mend the rift and start a political process to end the militancy, the two governments plan to organise tribal councils --known as jirgas -- on both sides of the border.
No dates have been fixed.
A Taliban spokesman last month said the group might join the jirgas if asked, but Omar rejected the proposal.
The only people who would participate are those who have sold out to foreign powers. 
Our participation is absolutely out of the question, the fugitive militant leader said.
He reiterated his call for the withdrawal of foreign troops to end conflict in Afghanistan.
Unless that happens, the war will heat further up, Omar warned.
Afghanistan says Omar is based in or around the southwest Pakistani city of Quetta. 
Pakistan says he is in Afghanistan.
At least 56 people, mostly beggars and homeless, have died during a cold snap in poor areas of northern Bangladesh this week, local officials and doctors said.
They said nearly 40 deaths were reported on Thursday alone, when the temperature dropped to 6 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures at this time of year usually hover around 8-10 degrees Celsius.
Weather officials said the cold spell, which began on Monday, was likely to continue for another week.
Thirty seven people were hurt, one seriously, after a leak of toxic chemicals from a chemical plant in northern England on Thursday, site operator BASF and emergency services said.
A spokeswoman for North East Ambulance Service said 37 people were treated at the scene for burns, skin irritations and breathing difficulties. 
Seventeen casualties were taken to three hospitals in the area, with one suffering serious burns.
The thirty seven casualties were decontaminated on site, the spokeswoman said. 
A BASF spokesman said workers on the site were admitted to hospital after a leak of hexamethylene diamine, a chemical used in the production of acrylic and nylon fibres and plastics at a plant in Seal Sands near Middlesbrough, northern England.
The German chemical company said it would launch an investigation into the incident.
Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai reiterated after meeting Pakistan's prime minister Thursday his strong objection to the neighbouring nation's plan to mine parts of their shared border.
Karzai also told reporters he was not satisfied with Pakistan's work on calling a tribal council to discuss the dragging Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan that was its bloodiest last year.
Despite Karzai's concerns, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz told the briefing that Pakistan was continuing to explore the mining and fencing of parts of the border to stem the cross-border movement of militants striking Afghanistan.
He also announced the establishment of a committee to discuss the planned tribal councils, called jirgas.
Aziz said the two leaders also agreed to speed up the process of sending home the three million Afghan refugees in camps in Pakistan that he said insurgents attacking Afghanistan sometimes used as safehavens.
And Pakistan would increase its grant assistance to Afghanistan by 50 million dollars, he said.
Karzai called Aziz to Afghanistan for the meeting, which lasted well over two hours -- longer than expected -- with relations between the two neighbours tested by allegations that each is not doing enough to end the vicious insurgency that has killed thousands.
The president said after the meeting he was very clear that the mining of the border and fencing the border cannot prevent terrorism but it will divide the two nations.
Afghanistan also opposed the idea because of the deadly human consequences of mines, he said. 
Terrorism cannot be terminated unless we target the sources, its roots and places where they get training, Karzai said, noting an increasing gap between the Muslim neighbours.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair flew home early from a holiday in the United States on Thursday in a bid to head off the potential collapse of latest efforts to restore regional government in Northern Ireland.
The prime minister has spent a significant amount of time over the past weeks talking to the leaders of Northern Ireland and he's returning to deal with this, a Downing Street spokesman said.
Blair flew home after failing in a series of phone calls to leaders of the British-ruled province's warring political parties to resolve a stand-off over policing -- one of the last obstacles to the restoration in March of a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly.
Sinn Fein, the province's largest nationalist party, indicated on Wednesday night a planned special meeting of its members to debate the issue later this month was in jeopardy because there had been no positive response from its pro-British political foe, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
But DUP lawmaker Nigel Dodds said on Thursday Sinn Fein had provided nothing tangible to merit a response.
Instead of whingeing and running to Tony Blair, Sinn Fein should get on with doing what it is supposed to do, he said.
Acceptance of the police by Sinn Fein, whose largely Roman Catholic support base wants a united Ireland, would be a huge shift for a party that has long viewed the province's law and order system as biased in favour of Protestants.
The DUP refuses to sit on a Belfast-based executive with Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political ally, until it fully backs the rule of law.
The British and Irish governments, which jointly drew up the latest plans for resurrecting devolution late last year, have warned this could be the last chance for a long time to reach a political settlement in the province. 
Blair has invested much political capital in resolving Northern Ireland's problems and is keen that when he leaves office this year the outlook there should be positive.
Despite its persistent political problems, Northern Ireland has been largely peaceful since the 1998 peace deal.
At least four Palestinians were killed Thursday in a major Israel army operation in the West Bank city of Ramallah that wounded more than 20 other people, medics said.
Yussef Abdel Khader were mortally wounded in gunfire that erupted after more than a dozen jeeps and several bulldozers, backed up by two helicopters, rolled into the center of the city.
The four later died of their wounds in hospital, medics said. Three people remained in critical condition in Ramallah hospitals.
An Israeli army spokeswoman said that forces had conducted an arrest operation and detained four wanted Palestinians. 
She declined to provide other details.
The incursion came as Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was headed to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks on restarting the Middle East peace process with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
The Palestinian Authority slammed the incursion, saying it was destroying any chances of jumpstarting the stalled peace process between Israelis and Palestinians.
We strongly condemn today's aggression in Ramallah, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat told AFP. The Israeli side is responsible for breaking down efforts to calm the situation.
The Israeli army vehicles rolled into Ramallah's central Manara Square just before 1400 GMT, with explosions and crackling rounds of automatic gunfire rocking the city center, adorned with Christmas decorations.
In an hour-long operation, jeeps drove to and from Manara Square, as bulldozers shunted aside cars in surrounding streets and clouds of thick white, green and red smoke rose above the streets.
Youths threw stones, metal trash barrels and blocks of concrete at the Israeli army vehicles from rooftops. 
Around a dozen lobbed rocks at the back of one bulldozer before scattering with the approach of an army vehicle.
Two wounded men were rushed from the scene in the arms of colleagues. 
One man ran through the street waving a white piece of cloth. 
Israeli soldiers crouched near a vehicle, their guns raised.
Car alarms set off by the explosions added to the cacophony.
With the retreat of the Israeli army vehicles, hundreds of people spilled into Manara and surrounding streets, chanting angry slogans as darkness fell.
Meanwhile the Israeli army carried out an incursion in Doha, a suburb of Bethlehem. 
According to a Palestinian security source, one Palestinian was wounded as a result.
Thursday's deaths bring to 5,623 the number of people killed since the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000, the vast majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP count.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with US President George W Bush on Thursday for talks expected to focus on strengthening trans-Atlantic relations.
Bush and Merkel will likely also discuss Iran's nuclear activities, the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. and the Middle East peace process.
Merkel, whose country in January assumed the rotating presidencies of the European Union and the Group of Eight nations, has discussed trying to reinvigorate negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
Merkel is also seeking to build tighter economic relations between the United States and European Union.
The conservative German leader and her host were also to discuss the 37-nation NATO-led force battling insurgents in Afghanistan, as well as climate change and energy issues, both sides said.
Merkel's US visit, her third since taking office nearly 14 months ago, came after Germany assumed the six-month presidency of the European Union and the year-long leadership of the Group of Eight industrialized countries.
Germany has laid out an ambitious agenda including plans to revitalize the so-called quartet for Middle East peace comprising the EU, the United States, Russia and the United Nations at what it considers to be an auspicious time.
Asked about such a project, and whether the United States backs a quartet meeting soon, White House spokesman Tony Snow replied: It will be discussed.
One of the things that we want to do is to encourage in every way possible effective movement toward a two-state solution, he said, adding that the quartet's conditions for peace were the backbone of that effort.
Washington aims to ensure that you've got a Palestinian negotiating partner that renounces violence, that believes in meeting all treaty obligations, and acknowledges Israel's right to exist, he said.
Bush's support would be key to any fresh start for the quartet amid European complaints that Washington has neglected efforts to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians while pouring resources into Iraq.
A German foreign ministry spokesman said Wednesday that Berlin hoped to call a quartet meeting as soon as possible and had already won Russian support for the initiative.
We would like to see the quartet take on a stronger role, Merkel's spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, said Wednesday.
The chancellor also planned to discuss climate protection and US-European trade ties with Bush.
She told Wednesday's Financial Times that she aimed to create a single transatlantic market for investors, with common rules and standards on issues such as intellectual property and financial regulation.
We must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together, where there are clear advantages for both sides, she told the daily.
In terms of transatlantic relations, it's something that we want to continue, to build strong relations with our allies in Europe, Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, told reporters ahead of the leaders' meeting and dinner.
As Europe's biggest economy and most populous country, Germany is facing high expectations for the dual presidencies of the EU and G8, which by coincidence fall together.
Officials from both sides have said the two leaders will also discuss Iran's disputed nuclear ambitions, instability in Lebanon and efforts to decide the final status of Kosovo.
Merkel also planned to press Bush on cutting greenhouse gases amid mounting European frustration at a US refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which runs out in 2012, or on proposing a viable alternative.
Of course we must and will talk with the Americans about the fact that they too should commit to reducing carbon dioxide (emissions), Merkel told the January issue of the political monthly Cicero.
It is a tough problem to tackle.
The EU wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the Kyoto pact by March. 
Germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020.
Snow said that Bush was very clear about his support for being able to supply energy needs in a way that's friendly to the environment and does not raise problems with global warming.
Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman on Thursday announced the dismissal of the head of the US nuclear weapons program after a series of security breaches and management problems.
Ambassador Linton Brooks, administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), will tender his resignation to President George W. Bush and leave his post later this month, Bodman said in a statement.
During my tenure at the department, and even before, there have been a number of management issues involving the National Nuclear Security Administration, the most recent of which was a serious security breach several months ago at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said Bodman, who has been energy chief for two years.
These management and security issues can have serious implications for the security of the United States. 
While I believe that the current NNSA management has done its best to address these concerns.
I do not believe that progress in correcting these issues has been adequate.
I have decided that it is time for new leadership at the NNSA, and I have asked for the resignation of NNSA Administrator, Linton Brooks.
Bodman said an interim administrator would be designated soon.
Investigators have identified two guards who illicitly filmed Saddam Hussein's execution, an official said on Thursday, as the Iraqi government sought to dampen growing outrage from Sunni Arabs over the unruly hanging.
The mobile phone video of Shi'ite officials taunting Saddam on the gallows has inflamed sectarian passions in a country on the brink of civil war.
Two Justice Ministry guards have been arrested. 
Other guards have identified them as having filmed the hanging, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's aide Sami al-Askari told Reuters.
U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to Maliki in a secure videoconference call on Thursday and agreed that investigating the recording of the execution was the right thing to do, White House spokesman Tony Snow said.
Bush, who is developing a new strategy on Iraq that could be unveiled as early as next week, spoke to Maliki about the way forward but not about his specific plan.
One option Bush is considering is a temporary increase in troops, but Snow would not say whether that was discussed in the conversation with Maliki.
They were talking about the importance of having sufficient force within Baghdad to create a stable situation within the city, Snow told reporters.
A prosecutor who attended Saddam's execution told Reuters he had seen two senior officials filming the hanging, prompting suggestions among some Iraqis that the guards might be used as scapegoats.
Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani told a news conference, The investigation is ongoing and we have identified those who flouted the rules. 
Even for a dictator like Saddam, the law must be obeyed.
The images, which show observers yelling Go to hell and chanting the name of a radical Shi'ite cleric before Saddam falls through the trap, have sparked angry demonstrations by Saddam's fellow Sunnis, fearful of Shi'ite ascendancy. 
Moderate Sunnis say it deals a blow to Maliki's call for reconciliation.
In Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's restive western province of Anbar, U.S. commanders met tribal chief Sheikh Sattar al-Buzayi, the U.S. military said in a statement on Thursday.
They discussed action being taken by Iraqi security troops with the help of U.S.-led forces in the region, the statement said but gave no further details. 
U.S. forces conducted a string of raids in Ramadi on Wednesday and detained 23 suspects with ties to senior Al Qaeda leaders. 
Buzayi is head of the Anbar Salvation Council, an umbrella group of tribes in Anbar frustrated with al Qaeda's growing influence in the province.
Barzan al-Tikriti, one of Saddam's half-brothers and his former intelligence chief, and Awad al-Bander, a former judge, were found guilty with Saddam two months ago over the killings of 148 Shi'ite men from the town of Dujail in the 1980s. Bander presided over the court that ordered the men's deaths.
Officials have said they will take more precautions for the executions of Barzan and Bander, including checking witnesses for cameras and mobile phones.
Thousands of Sunni Arabs have marched in the Sunni heartland to vent anger at Saddam's execution, and mourners have flocked to Saddam's grave in his home village of Awja.
On Thursday, hundreds of Shi'ites marched in the southern city of Basra to support the execution in a demonstration organised by the local office of Maliki's Dawa party.
The United Nations has suspended four peacekeepers amid allegations of child sex abuse in Sudan, the Daily Telegraph reported Friday, citing anonymous UN sources.
One of the four Bangladeshis was accused of serious sexual assault on a minor and sent home, while three colleagues were repatriated for allegedly knowing of his actions but failing to act in line with policy, the paper said.
Earlier this week, the Telegraph claimed that UN staff and peacekeepers have been accused of abusing children as young as 12 in southern Sudan.
There are some 10,000 UN personnel in the area who arrived two years ago to help with reconstruction after a 23-year civil war.
The UN said Thursday it was verifying the allegations to see if they are new or already under investigation.
But a spokeswoman for new chief Ban Ki-moon stressed that the UN's policy on the issue was zero tolerance, meaning zero complacency and zero impunity.
Recent clashes between rival Palestinian Fatah and Hamas groups have brought on an agreement Friday between Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh and President Mahmoud Abbas to keep gunmen off Gaza's streets, reported Israeli media.
Haniyeh, with the radical Hamas, said after his first meeting with Abbas in two months that they have agreed to withdraw all gunmen from the streets and deploy police forces to keep law and order,  Ha'aretz newspaper reported. 
Abbas made no comment.
On Thursday, firefights broke out between forces loyal to Abbas and the Hamas government in northern Gaza, killing six people and wounding 18 others.
Similar agreements to end the inter-Palestinian violence have been quickly broken by violence.
More than 100,000 North Korean refugees are likely to flee to Japan if a crisis hits the Korean Peninsula, well beyond Japan's capacity to deal with such an influx, a Japanese newspaper reported on Friday.
The Asahi Shimbun said the government has estimated that 100,000 to 150,000 people would arrive from North Korea and has been discussing with the United States how to deal with such a situation.
Japan could only provide temporary shelter for several tens of thousands of displaced persons and would need to consider transferring them to third countries in such a case, the Asahi quoted government sources as saying.
The refugees are expected to head to southern Japan from ports on North Korea's east coast. 
The government estimate was based on the number of ships and boats North Korea is believed to have.
Japan and the United States started discussions last month on how to deal with a North Korean crisis following Pyongyang's missile and nuclear tests last year, the paper said.
Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels set off a powerful explosion aboard a bus, killing at least five people and wounding 50 others near Sri Lankan capital Colombo, defence ministry said.
A bomb ripped through the passenger bus as it travelled between Nittambuwa and Giriulla during the evening rush hour on the Colombo-Kandy highway.
The traffic police said the blast forced the temporary closure of the A1, the main road between the capital and the central provincial town of Kandy.
The bus immediately caught fire, eye witnesses said.
The bus was full of passengers at the time of the blast. 
It has still not been possible to identify the cause of the blast or the number of casualties, military spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe said.
This is the work of the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam), Samarasinghe said.
Keheliya Rambukwella, the government's defence affairs spokesman and the Minister of Policy Planning, added: The historical evidence points the finger towards the Tigers for the blast.
These are signs of desperation in view of the defeats they have faced recently in the battlefield. 
He said it was too early to determine if the blast was caused by a grenade or another form of explosion.
The main hospital in Colombo was placed on alert for casualties.
We have sent 3 ambulances to the explosion site, a spokesman at the local hospital at Wathupitiwala said.
The bus attack came hours after the Tigers accused the government forces of penetrating into their area of control in the north triggering a mine.
There was no immediate response from the Tigers to the military spokesman's allegation.
Five Chinese telecommunications workers were abducted early Friday in Nigeria's oil-rich southern Niger Delta by unidentified armed men, a Chinese diplomat told AFP.
Yes it is true that the five Chinese were abducted this morning in Rivers State by armed men. 
We are trying to save them from these militants who abducted them, the diplomat who identified himself simply as Wu, told AFP by telephone.
We are asking for help from the Nigerian government. 
We have informed the Nigerian authorities about the abduction, said Wu, of the embassy's information department.
He neither gave the identities of the abducted Chinese, the telecommunications company they work for nor the circumstances surrounding the incident.
No group or individual has yet claimed responsibility for the kidnap, the first known such incident this year.
An armed group, the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), has claimed responsibility for the abduction nearly a month ago of three Italians and one Lebanese working for an Italian oil firm, Agip.
The four foreign oil workers, abducted last December 7 from southern Bayelsa State in the Niger Delta region, are still being held by MEND activists.
Unknown gunmen opened fire at worshippers leaving a mosque in the central Gaza Strip Friday afternoon, killing a local imam and injuring at least one other Palestinian, witnesses said.
The imam was initially critically injured in the shooting in the Mughazi refugee camp, but died of his wounds shortly afterwards.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but residents believed that militants of the opposition Fatah party, who have engaged in bloody street clashes with the ruling, radical Islamic Hamas movement, were behind it because the targets were Islamists.
An American and his two Iraqi interpreters were kidnapped near the southern Iraqi city of Basra Friday, Basra police chief said.
The three were kidnapped this morning from Al-Haritha area north of Basra, said Mohammed al-Mussawi.
Another police officer from Basra said the three were travelling in a black Opel car when three other cars full of gunmen ambushed them and kidnapped them.
US embassy spokesman Louis Fintor in Baghdad said the embassy was looking into these reports.
It was not immediately clear if the missing man was a security contractor.
Last month five Westerners -- four Americans and an Austrian -- were kidnapped from Basra and are still being held hostage.
The group of private security contractors was escorting a convoy in Safwan near Basra on behalf of Kuwaiti-based Crescent Security when the men were abducted by kidnappers wearing police uniforms.
The kidnappers released a video of the five earlier this week showing them to be in a healthy condition but asking for the release of all prisoners in American- and British-run prisons in Iraq.
Several Islamist and nationalist resistance groups operate in the country, along with illegal political militias, corrupt security force units and criminal gangs who kidnap hostages for ransom.
Supermodel Naomi Campbell pleaded guilty Tuesday in New York to chargers of misdemeanour assault stemming from an incident in which she hit her maid with a cell phone over a pair of missing jeans.
I threw a cell phone in the apartment. The cell phone hit Ana, Campbell, 36, told Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Robert Mandelbaum.
This was an accident because I did not intend to hit her.
The incident occurred in Campbell's New York apartment in March.
According to reports, Campbell's cell phone hit maid Ana Scolavino on the back of the head and she had to be treated for head injuries. 
In exchange for her guilty plea, Campbell must pay Scolavino's medical expenses of 363 dollars, do five days of community service and attend a two-day anger management programme.
Globe-trotting Hollywood couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have moved to New Orleans and plan to send their three children to school there, Us Weekly magazine reported on Tuesday.
We love it there, Jolie was quoted as saying in confirming the move at the Golden Globe awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Monday night. 
The kids are going to go to school there. 
We're really looking forward to it.
Representatives for Pitt and Jolie could not immediately be reached for comment.
But according to the story posted on the magazine's Web site, the couple's relocation to the flood-ravaged Louisiana city is at least partly in keeping with their off-screen devotion to various humanitarian causes around the world. 
They spent Christmas Day handing out presents to Colombian war refugees in Costa Rica.
According to Us Weekly, the movie star pair moved to the Big Easy on Jan. 11 and have purchased a $3.5 million, six-bed mansion in the city's French Quarter -- the fourth house owned by the couple.
One diner at a Decatur Street restaurant told the magazine he saw Jolie quietly mixing with the locals the day after she and Pitt moved to town.
Us Weekly cites unnamed sources as saying Jolie plans on keeping a low profile in her newly adopted home town, where Pitt is currently on location shooting his latest film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.
She's interested in befriending normal moms so she can do things with the kids, one source told the magazine, adding that the couple also hopes to raise awareness for the hurricane-devastated Gulf Coast region.
They think it is important to be there right now and are already looking to get more involved in local charity work, the source said. 
According to Us Weekly, construction is set to start this month on 20 environment-friendly homes Pitt has jointly commissioned with the group Global Green USA.
Pitt, currently starring in the globe-spanning drama Babel, and Jolie, an Oscar winner for her role in Girl, Interrupted, co-starred as married assassins hired to kill each other in the film Mr. and Mrs. Smith. 
According to Jolie, they began a romantic relationship after Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston broke up in early 2005.
Jolie has said they have no plans to marry but are committed to raising their three children together.
Jolie adopted 5-year-old son Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 and 2-year-old daughter, Zahara, from Ethiopia, in 2005. 
She gave birth last year in Namibia to her first biological child, a daughter fathered by Pitt they named Shiloh. 
Pitt has also become the adoptive father of Maddox and Zahara.
A Colombian drug ring that smuggled $7.5 million of cocaine and heroin into the United States was shut down on Tuesday with the arrest of 117 of its suspected members, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said.
Among the cache seized by drug agents was 55 kilograms of heroin, 173 kilograms of cocaine, $260,000 in cash, 12 vehicles and nine weapons, said John Gilbride, special agent for the DEA's New York office.
A federal grand jury in Manhattan has charged 10 of the suspects, including alleged ringleader Ismael Jimenez-Sanchez, a Colombian citizen, with conspiracy to import heroin, U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said.
If convicted, each faces life in prison and a $4 million fine, Garcia said.
The ring, based in Pereira, Colombia, trafficked the drugs through South America and the Caribbean to the eastern United States, where the drugs were distributed throughout New York, Baltimore and Detroit, Gilbride said.
The ring's couriers used various smuggling methods, including swallowing heroin pellets on commercial flights to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and stashing the drug in the soles of their shoes, he said.
A Dutch oil worker and a Nigerian serviceman were killed on Tuesday when armed men attacked a small ferry near a huge Nigerian oil and gas export complex, industry sources said.
Militants attacked a Hyundai company boat in transit from Port Harcourt to Bonny Island, one navy rating and one Dutch expat were killed, one of the sources said, asking not to be named.
A spokesman at the Dutch foreign ministry said. 
We are aware of an incident and there was some Dutch involvement, but cannot confirm whether there were any Dutch casualties.
We are looking into the matter, he added.
A Dutch diplomat in Nigeria said he was not able to comment.
There were conflicting reports of the attack on the boat operated by the South Korean conglomerate.
Two industry sources put the number of dead at four, while another said two were killed and four injured in the attack near the Bonny Island oil and gas complex in Rivers state.
One of them said four people were being treated for gunshot wounds at an oil industry clinic in Bonny Island, a huge industrial complex which exports 400,000 barrels a day of oil and about 20 million tonnes per year of liquefied natural gas.
A local police spokesman said he was not aware of the incident.
The attack comes amid a spiralling communal conflict at a nearby community in Rivers State where 12 people were killed on Sunday. It is the latest example of an intensifying wave of violence across Nigeria's southern oil delta.
The industry sources said the boat ferry was only operating because poor visibility caused by seasonal dust clouds had grounded helicopters.
Rivers State is in the eastern side of the Niger Delta, a vast wetlands region which contains all of Nigeria's petroleum resources.
Oil multinationals have pulled out thousands of workers from the western side of the delta since a wave of militant attacks last February, cutting output in the world's eighth largest oil exporter by a fifth.
Last month multinationals evacuated hundreds of workers' dependants from the eastern delta after two car bombings in oil company compounds.
Dozens of foreign oil workers were kidnapped last year by armed groups seeking ransoms, by communities seeking greater benefits from oil companies, and by militants fighting for more autonomy for the impoverished delta.
Eight foreign oil workers are currently being held by two different groups. 
Many analysts expect the problems to worsen as political turf wars escalate in the runup to general elections in April.
Unidentified gunmen murdered Guatemala's main port union chief in front of his two young children, police said on Tuesday.
Several men carrying 9-mm guns shot union boss Pedro Zamora as he drove home to Escuintla, two hours south of the capital late Monday night, police spokeswoman Olimpia Pineda said. Two of Zamora's children, aged 3 and 5, were in the car at the time of the attack.
Zamora's 3-year-old son was injured in the shooting, Pineda said. 
The motive for the murder is unknown, she said.
Zamora (43) led the 500-member union at Puerto Quetzal, the country's main port, for eight years and had received death threats.
Union organizers were often targeted as leftist guerrilla sympathizers and murdered during the Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended a decade ago and left a quarter million people dead or missing.
Political violence against labor leaders has decreased in recent years, but many leftist groups regularly receive death threats.
This is the second time one of our members has been attacked, union secretary Lazaro Reyes told Reuters. 
Another union leader was shot in the chest six months ago and survived. 
That case has not been solved.
It's hard to work under these circumstances, you don't know what could happen next, Reyes said.
Labor rights groups said the port was negotiating a new labor contract with the union when Zamora was killed.
Guatemala is a major transshipment point for Colombian cocaine moving to the United States and sees hundreds of drug gang-style executions every year.
Beluga whales were once so thick in the waters along Alaska's biggest city that boaters had to take care to avoid bumping them.
But now Cook Inlet's population of small white whales, beloved by locals and tourists, may be headed for extinction, according to a report from government biologists last week. 
A new count by the National Marine Fisheries Service puts the Beluga whale population at 302, less than half the number in 1994 and well below the 1,000 to 2,000 believed to have been swimming in earlier years in the glacier-fed channel that runs from Anchorage to the Gulf of Alaska.
There's basically a one in four chance that this population is going to become extinct in 100 years, said Bruce Smith, a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist studying the belugas.
The Cook Inlet belugas, a genetically distinct population already listed as a depleted and meriting special management under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, are candidates for new safeguards under the Endangered Species Act.
Biologists say the reason for the precipitous decline since the 1990s was simple -- overharvesting by the area's Alaska Natives, mostly Athabascan Indians, who are entitled by law to pursue their traditional whale hunts.
Native groups agreed to curb hunting until stocks return to higher levels, but that does not appear to be helping the whales recover, according to Smith.
Environmentalists say it should be no surprise that Belugas are faltering in Alaska's most industrialized waterway.
Oil drilling, associated bustle and noise, vessel-traffic pressures from thriving cargo-shipping and commercial fishing activities, sewage and storm water runoff from Alaska's most densely populated region and other industrial factors are likely hurting the Belugas, according to environmentalists.
Particular scrutiny should focus on the oil and gas industry, with its constant marine disposal of wastewater and its reliance on loud seismic surveys that disrupt the underwater whale communications, said Bob Shavelson, executive director of the environmental group Cook Inletkeeper.
Everybody said, 'OK, it was the hunting.' 
Oil and gas industry representatives fear new restrictions will unfairly burden them.
There's a lot of interest in being able to use the inlet the way it's been used by the people, bringing all the groceries in and all the cars in as well as the oil and gas, and still protect the belugas at the same time, said Judy Brady, a former state natural resources commissioner who heads the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.
Smith said it may be the nonpollution factors, such as noise, inadvertent harassment, large-scale beach strandings, disease outbreaks and the occasional predation by killer whales that are keeping the beluga population low.
Those factors might have been easily absorbed in the past, but not anymore.
It could be now that the population is reduced to the point where some threats and impacts that weren't threatening to the whole stock, now are, he said.
An Argentine judge on Tuesday issued a second arrest warrant for former President Maria Estela Martinez de Peron, the leader more commonly known as Isabel Peron, for her alleged involvement with a right-wing death squad.
Isabel Peron was briefly detained on Friday by Spanish police in Madrid in a different case involving the disappearance of a student activist in the 1970s. 
A judge later granted her provisional release pending an extradition request from Argentina.
On Tuesday, Argentine Federal Judge Norberto Oyarbide ordered her arrest in the country or abroad, in connection with her alleged involvement with the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance, a right-wing death squad known as the Triple A.
The group was founded by a government minister during Peron's time as president, and is allegedly responsible for the deaths of 1,500 people.
Isabel or Isabelita Peron, 75, has lived in Madrid since 1981. 
She was sworn in as president in 1974 after the death of her husband, three-time president Juan Peron.
Her government was overthrown by a military coup in 1976, and systematic crimes during that regime that ended in 1983 killed up to 30,000 thousand people.
For the first time, a majority of American women are living without a spouse, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
The daily, which based its report on an analysis of census results, said 51 percent of women in 2005 reported living without a spouse, up from 35 percent in 1950 and 49 percent in 2000.
Coupled with the fact that in 2005 married couples became a minority of all American households for the first time, the trend could ultimately shape social and workplace policies, including the ways government and employers distribute benefits, the newspaper said.
It said that several factors are behind the shift including women marrying at a later age and living with partners for more often and for longer periods. 
Women are also living longer as widows and once divorced, often opt to stay single, the report said.
According to the Census figures, only about 30 percent of black women are living with a spouse, compared with 49 percent of Hispanic women, 55 percent of non-Hispanic white women and more than 60 percent of Asian women.
North Korea defended its shock nuclear weapons  test Wednesday as the only way to avert a war as its chief negotiator met with  his US counterpart to discuss resuming multi-party disarmament talks.
US envoy Christopher Hill held a rare meeting Tuesday with the North's Kim Kye-gwan at the US embassy in Berlin and, although there was no breakthrough, officials said it set the pace for a resumption of full six-party talks.
The Berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the September 19 statement, South Korea's foreign minister Song Min-Soon said, referring to a 2005 accord offering the North security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament.
Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's ruling party paper, said the October 9 test, the regime's first atomic weapons detonation ever, was in self-defence.
There is no doubt that a war would have broken out... if (North Korea) had failed last year to shatter the moves of the US imperialists to provoke a war against it with its strong self-defensive deterrent, it said.
It accused the United States of still whetting the sword of aggression against North Korea under the disguise of seeking peaceful dialogue.
The test triggered global outrage and UN sanctions, and in December senior negotiators from the six nations in the talks -- the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States -- met for five days in Beijing.
No progress was reported as North Korea refused substantiative discussions about nuclear disarmament in protest at separate US financial sanctions.
Bilateral US-North Korean talks on the financial sanctions, notably on a Macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of Pyongyang, are to resume next week.
No date has been fixed for the next round of full six-party negotiations, however.
Song urged Pyongyang to initiate the process of dismantling its nuclear programmes to enable others to take corresponding steps in return.
In December's talks in Beijing, the United States reportedly demanded that North Korea report all of its nuclear facilities and programme and accept UN atomic agency inspectors.
The United States was also said to have demanded the closure of the North's plutonium-producing reactor in Yongbyon and its nuclear test site.
Two U.S. soldiers have been killed in western Iraq, the U.S. military said on Wednesday.
One of the soldiers died on Monday, the other on Wednesday, a U.S. statement said, adding that they died from wounds sustained in combat in the restive western province of Anbar.
More than 3,000 U.S. soldiers have died since the start of the U.S. invasion in March 2003, causing mounting concern among the U.S. public about the war.     
U.S. President George W. Bush said this month he planned to send an extra 21,500 U.S. troops to Iraq to help stabilise the country, despite opinion polls showing most Americans oppose sending more troops.
Former Iraqi vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan will be sentenced to death within five weeks, it was reported Wednesday.
The Iraqi appeals court will hold a session January 25 to announce the death penalty verdict, Iraqi General Persecutor Jaafar al-Musawi told pan-Arab al-Hayat newspaper.
Ramadan will be sentenced to death for his involvement in the 1982 killing of 148 Shiites in Dujail following a failed attempt on the life of former dictator Saddam Hussein.
Saddam and two of his former aides have already sentenced to death and hanged for their roles in the killings.
An appeal is mandatory according to the Iraqi law.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday described the Holocaust as a pretext for the creation of Israel in a Western attempt to dominate the region.
Ahmadinejad made the comments in an interview published by the Spanish daily El Mundo, which met the president during his visit to the Nicaraguan capital Managua.
Ahmadinejad said researchers were not allowed to ask questions about the Holocaust. 
If it really existed, where did it take place, he queried, asking what the Palestinians had to do with it.
Ahmadinejad called the Holocaust a pretext for the establishment of the dictatorial, totalitarian Israeli regime which was created essentially to threaten other nations.
Western countries had imposed the Zionist regime on the region to promote their economic and political interests, Ahmadinejad charged.
But Israel will never dare attack Iran, neither they nor their masters, he added.
Ahmadinejad also accused the United States and Britain of favouring insecurity in Iraq and of seeking to divide its population along religious lines. dpa st sc
An Afghan army vehicle struck a remote-controlled bomb in eastern Afghanistan Wednesday, killing three soldiers and wounding four others, an official said.
The Afghan National Army vehicle struck the bomb in the province of Khost, which adjoins the border with Pakistan, army General Sami Ul Haq said.
The general did not say who planted the bomb, but similar explosions have been blamed on the Taliban, which carries out regular attacks on Afghan and foreign soldiers.
Khost saw a surge in Taliban-linked attacks in the past year, which was the worst since the insurgency was launched after the hardliners were forced out of government in a US-led operation in 2001.
A 27-year-old Egyptian woman tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, a World Health Organisation official said on Wednesday.
The virus has claimed 10 lives in Egypt while eight other positive cases recovered since it first surfaced in Egyptian poultry in February.
Unfortunately, yes there is a new case, said Hassan el-Bushra, regional adviser for communicable diseases surveillance for the World Health Organisation.
He told Reuters tests carried out by Egyptian authorities were positive for the H5N1 virus and he was awaiting the results of a second set of tests.
The official Middle East News Agency (MENA) identified the woman as Warda Eid Ahmed from the province of Beni Suef south of the capital Cairo.
The agency quoted an Egyptian Health Ministry official as saying she has been hospitalised since Jan. 13 with a serious pulmonary inflammation.
Bombers hit the Iraqi capital's volatile Shiite district of Sadr City on Wednesday, killing 15 people, a day after scores of students and teachers were slaughtered in attacks at a nearby university.
A car bomb ripped through a crowded marketplace in Sadr City, a politically sensitive, impoverished district of Shiite zealots, leaving 15 dead and 33 wounded, a security official said.
The area is a regular target for Sunni extremists in the bitter sectarian conflict plaguing the capital.
Iraq's deadliest bomb attack to date also occurred in Sadr City -- home to thousands of young followers of radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr -- last November when 202 people were killed.
Wednesday's attack came a day after 70 people were killed and 138 wounded in a twin bombing outside the renowned Mustansiriyah University which lies near the Shiite stronghold.
Shocked and angry students staged a protest Wednesday in the central Karada district against the university bombing.
Some waved banners in protest against the deadliest attack in the war-torn country this year, while others shouted slogans demanding greater security.
Police sealed off the Mustansiriyah campus and the education ministry ordered three days of mourning and told institutions to hold prayers for the victims.
Dozens of Iraqis donated blood for wounded survivors of the attack, and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki promised stern action against criminal gangs.
We will clean Baghdad from terrorists and outlaws, he told a gathering of foreign ambassadors based in Baghdad, vowing that security forces would track down the death squads.
Many in the violence-wracked capital had expected a major attack following the botched execution on December 30 of Saddam Hussein, who was taunted by a guard, allegedly a Shiite, in his final moments.
Sunni sentiment was hurt further by the hanging on Monday of two Saddam aides, including the ousted president's half-brother, during which one was decapitated.
Greek protestors burned several cars in central Athens and battled riot police outside the city's Polytechnic University during a student protest against a government draft bill to reform higher education Wednesday, local media reports said.
The protestors caused damage but no injuries when they threw cocktail bombs at five cars parked along the route of a student demonstration through central Athens.
The cars included a diplomatic car belonging to the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
A cafeteria was also reportedly set on fire.
Clashes were also reported for several hours outside the Polytechnic University between riot police firing tear gas and hooded rebels hurling cocktail bombs, stones, sticks and rocks.
Earlier, riot police fired teargas at hundreds of demonstrators who attempted to break through a police barricade in front of parliament to protest against a government draft bill to reform higher education and allow the operation of private universities.
Last week, thousands of teachers and public servants participated in a one-day strike in support of the students which forced the closure of state schools, universities, government offices, tax offices and state banks.
Private tertiary education institutions are banned from operating in Greece and the conservative government believes the new law, allowing for the operation of private universities, would lead to greater competitiveness and higher educational standards.
Teachers, students and union leaders insist the government should upgrade free public education instead and fear the move could lead to higher education costs and lower teaching standards.
Educators accuse the government of failing to keep one of its main pre-election promises of hiking education funding to 5 per cent of GDP from a current 3.5 per cent.
Three foreigners, including a US national, a Croatian and a Hungarian, were killed Wednesday in a western Baghdad ambush that also took the life of a private Iraqi guard, a US aid organisation said.
The US citizen, a woman, worked for the National Democratic Institute, a non-governmental organisation that provides support for political parties in Iraq, said Leslie Campbell, NDI regional director for the Middle East who spoke from Washington.
A convoy of NDI employees protected by an international security company was attacked this morning in Baghdad. 
Four people were killed, among them was one American citizen from NDI, Campbell told AFP.
It was a very serious attack, Campbell said, adding that only two bodies had been recovered and the killed NDI employee was a woman.
He did not say whether the body of the woman was one of those recovered.
A US embassy official said the embassy was aware of an incident and was trying to determine the facts.
The victims, whose identities were not disclosed, had just left the headquarters of the Islamic Party, the leading Sunni Arab political bloc in the Yarmuk district of Baghdad, two other sources said.
The Croatian, Hungarian and Iraqi were guards working for the Australian security agency URG, Campbell and a security source said.
The security source said six Iraqi guards had been killed when gunmen opened fire from several rooftop positions, but Campbell could not provide confirmation.
Several vehicles were set on fire, and some of the victims died amid the blaze, the source said.

Mutations, moreover, occur very seldom.
Mutations, in time, occur incoherently.
Mutations were defects that occurred, for unknown reasons, in the inheritance mechanism of living things.
Mutations cannot make a living thing acquire a new organ or a new trait.
Mutations are defined as breaks or replacements taking place in the DNA molecule, which is found in the nuclei of the cells of a living organism and which contains all its genetic information.
Mutations add no new information to an organism's DNA.
Mutation, which evolutionists frequently hide behind, is not a magic wand that transforms living organisms into a more advanced and perfect form.
Mutation is arbitrary disconnections, dislocations or shifts of genes in living things.
Mutation cannot explain the differences between birds and land animals.

Arsenal needed a late equaliser from Theo Walcott to salvage a 1-1 draw against arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur in a pulsating League Cup semi-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.
Tottenham took the lead after 37 minutes when Robbie Keane squared for Jermaine Jenas to score with a first-time, right-footed shot despite looking to be offside.
Spurs, who had not beaten Arsenal for 20 matches since November 1999 and have not won an away match against them for nearly 15 years, came within 11 minutes of ending that barren spell before Arsenal equalised.
Eduardo, who replaced Robin van Persie at halftime, found Walcott with a clever through ball and while Spurs defender Lee Young-pyo appeared to have stifled the effort, the ball bounced off him, onto Walcott's chest and into the net.
Tottenham coach Juande Ramos dropped England goalkeeper Paul Robinson for the match and his replacement, Czech Radek Cerny, and the Spurs defence needed to be at their best to survive an opening 30-minute onslaught from Arsene Wenger's young team.
Ramos was non-committal about whether Robinson was still his No.1 choice and whether he would play against Chelsea on Saturday.
He is a good goalkeeper and shown what a good keeper he can be, he told a news conference.
Despite dominating much of the first half, Arsenal's only serious attempt on goal was Nicklas Bendtner's powerful 14th-minute header, which Cerny dived to his left to save.
Spurs, knocked out by Arsenal in the semi-finals last season, gradually began to assert themselves and Steed Malbranque squandered an excellent chance to give them the lead after 32 minutes, firing wide with only goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to beat.
A minute later Malbranque headed wide under pressure and Dimitar Berbatov, the outstanding player on the field, forced Fabianski into a fine save with a long-range shot.
Spurs were enjoying a rare spell of domination when Jenas gave them the lead.
Keane had a chance to increase Spurs' lead but shot wide early in the second half.
Jermain Defoe, who came on as a late substitute, went close to winning it for the visitors only to fire high and wide.
Arsenal manager Wenger was a relieved man afterwards.
It was a good result for us considering Tottenham made more chances than us.
In the second half I felt we were better defensively, but we didn't create much.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger denied Wednesday newspaper reports in Germany that goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was on the brink of joining Borussia Dortmund.
It's not true, Wenger told Sky Sports after Arsenal's 1-1 League Cup semi-final first leg draw at the Emirates Stadium.
Not for Jens and not for us, the Frenchman added.
I deny that Jens has agreed personal terms with Dortmund and I deny that we have an agreement with Dortmund.
The German club's sporting director Michael Zorc told Thursday's edition of the Bild newspaper: Between Lehmann and ourselves everything has been settled, we've been in permanent contact.
There are a few details to sort out, but they're nothing to do with Dortmund.
As far as salary is concerned, Jens and Dortmund have reached an agreement.
According to Zorc, a deal could be reached within the coming days, allowing Lehmann to join the team on their winter break training camp in Marbella, Spain which begins Thursday.
Germany international Lehmann has lost his Arsenal place to Manuel Almunia and Dortmund have been trying to put together a deal to take him to the Bundesliga.
The 38-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and the Gunners are believed to be ready to offer him a free transfer.
Even though Wenger routinely fields second-string sides in the League Cup, there was no place in the team for Lehmann on Wednesday with Lukasz Fabianski in goal for Arsenal.
She might be a 31-year-old mother and considered past her prime by some, but Lindsay Davenport shapes as a dangerous floater at the Australian Open.
The former world number one, who won here in 2000, was expected to retire after 11 months off to have a baby, but she is back, and with a vengeance.
Since returning to competitive tennis in September following the birth of her son, Jagger, Davenport has won 18 of 19 matches and three of four tournaments to extend her career total to 54 WTA titles.
Along the way she has disposed of Jelena Jankovic, the world three, and Daniela Hantuchova, the world number nine, proving that she still has what it takes.
Davenport said she didn't plan to return to competition after starting a family.
But she admitted she began to feel the urge to play just weeks after giving birth in June.
The strength of her comeback has been a revelation, and her confidence is high as she heads to the first Grand Slam of the year with her sights on at least a quarter-final showing.
I started off playing a few of the smaller tournaments, tier threes and fours, and it's astonished me, she said after winning the Auckland Classic this month.
I didn't think my body would bounce back as fast as it has after giving birth, and the strain of pregnancy, so I'm excited now about going to the huge stage of the Australian Open and seeing what can happen.
Given she is now ranked 52 in the world and will be unseeded in Melbourne, the three-time Grand Slam winner will be hoping for a favourable draw, knowing the real test of where she is at lies ahead.
Sitting here now, I would be really excited to get to the quarter-finals, she said.
I don't know the level of the top few girls and don't know exactly where I am compared with them.
But I feel like I'm better than a lot of the girls out there and I'd like the opportunity to show that.
There were probably about five opponents Davenport wanted to avoid first up, including world number one Justine Henin and the Williams sisters, Venus and defending champion Serena.
But I definitely see myself as the biggest floater in the draw.
I'm sure no one would be excited to get me in the first round as well.
Hopefully, I'll get to work my way into the tournament.
Since returning to tennis, Davenport has won in Bali, Quebec, and Auckland and made the semi-finals in Beijing.
She has reached the third round at least in all 13 Australian Open campaigns she has contested since 1993, making the quarter-finals or better nine times.
Juan Arango's second-half strike gave Real Mallorca a slender advantage after they beat Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid 2-1 at home in the first leg of their King's Cup last-16 tie on Thursday.
Mallorca's Argentine striker Oscar Trejo stabbed home from close range at a corner in the 23rd minute, but two minutes later compatriot Gonzalo Higuain lashed a superb volley high into the net to level the scores.
The home side had had a good shout for a penalty waved away, but early in the second half Venezuelan forward Arango fired in a long range effort to put the 2003 winners back in front.
Both sides' goalkeepers pulled off spectacular reflex saves to deny Arango and Real substitute Javier Saviola as the half progressed, with Mallorca having the better of the game.
Atletico Madrid may be left to rue their poor finishing after being held to a 0-0 home draw by Valladolid earlier in the evening.
Atletico's Diego Forlan and Luis Garcia were guilty of the worst offences in an open contest which could have gone either way.

He is looking to leave Tottenham and Villa are a big club with great potential,McKay said.
Barcelona's Brazilian midfielder Edmilson has torn a groin muscle but the full extent of the problem will not be known for a few more days, the club said.

He had just returned to action after seven months out with a serious knee injury.
Marcos Baghdatis set up a final against Andy Roddick at the Kooyong Classic with a 6-2 7-5 win over Chilean Fernando Gonzalez on Friday, declaring himself ready for a good run at next week's Australian Open.
The Cypriot, who reached the final at Melbourne Park two years ago, coped admirably with a gusting wind at Kooyong as he tamed the big-hitting Gonzalez, who was runner-up to Roger Federer at last year's Australian Open.
I'm ready, I guess, Baghdatis told reporters.
I'm starting to feel better and better, to move better and better on the court.
Tennis-wise it's getting better, serving better, so good.
After his superb run to the final in Melbourne in 2006, Baghdatis reached the top 10 but struggled last year, before ending the season with a semi-final showing in the final Masters Series event of the year, in Paris.
The 22-year-old is seeded 15th for next week's Australian Open but has a tough draw, with former world number ones Marat Safin and Lleyton Hewitt potential opponents in the second and third rounds.
Baghdatis said he had not seen his draw, but believes he was capable of another strong showing.
I think I have the game to beat anybody, he said.
I don't want to have a big head, but I think I have, so I'll just try to go on the court and find a solution to win.
Roddick has won two of his three matches against Baghdatis but the Cyrpiot beat him at the Australian Open on the way to the final in 2006 and said he would be doing everything to win the title, despite the eight-man event only being an exhibition.
I will go on the court and try to win it, 100 percent, he said.
I won't think about the Aussie Open until after the match.
World number one Roger Federer will begin the defence of his Australian Open title against Argentine Diego Hartfield after the draw was made at Melbourne Park on Friday.
The Swiss, bidding for his 13th grand-slam title, was handed a kind draw in the early stages, though he could face a quarter-final against seventh seed Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, whom he beat in the final 12 months ago.
Federer had to pull out of the warm-up event at Kooyong because of a virus but is expected to be fully fit to play.
Third seed Novak Djokovic is his projected semi-final opponent, though Argentine David Nalbandian, who beat Federer twice at the end of last year, is lurking in the same half.
Second seed Rafael Nadal, number six Andy Roddick, eighth seed Richard Gasquet and number nine Andy Murray are all in the opposite half.
Nadal and Roddick will both play qualifiers in the first round, while Murray has a tough opening match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the world number 38 from France.
Women's top seed Justine Henin of Belgium takes on Aiko Nakimura of Japan in the first round.
The Belgian, who won the French Open and U.S. Open in 2007, has a seemingly clear path through to the quarter-finals, where she is scheduled to play fifth seed Maria Sharapova.
However, the Russian is likely to face a tough second-round match against former champion Lindsay Davenport.
Davenport, who is unseeded this year, has won three titles in her four events since returning to the tour in September, having had a year off, during which she had her first child.
Serena Williams will begin the defence of her title against Jarmila Gajdosova, a Slovakia-born wildcard now playing for Australia.
The seventh seed, who won her eighth grand-slam title 12 months ago, is scheduled to play third seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia in the quarter-finals, while Henin would be her likely semi-final opponent.
American Venus Williams, seeded eighth, is in the opposite half and could play Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli, whom she beat to win the Wimbledon title last year, in the fourth round.
Williams would then be likely to play fourth seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia in the quarter-finals.
World number 12 Tommy Haas, a former semi-finalist at Melbourne Park, pulled out on the eve of the draw because of injury.
Iraq international midfielder Nashat Akram, who plays for Al-Ain in the United Arab Emirates, is set to sign for Premiership club Manchester City, an official of the Emirati club said on Friday.
According to official Hamad ben Nakhirat al-Ameri, the clubs have reached agreement, the medical has been undertaken, but no contract has been signed.
Neither a transfer fee nor length of contract was revealed.
The contract has yet to be signed, but the deal is almost done, he told AFP.
The 23-year-old Akram was third in the vote for the 2007 Asian player of the year and was part of the Iraq team which won the Asian Cup for the first time in July last year.
Egypt sent a warning to rivals for their African Nations Cup crown when they crushed Cameroon 4-2 in the Group C opener in Kumasi on Tuesday.
Striker Mohamed Zidan scored a double and Hosni Abd Rabou also struck twice for the five-times African champions with Samuel Eto'o netting Cameroon's two at the Baba Yara stadium.
Zambia took the early lead in the group courtesy of a 3-0 victory over Sudan in the later match.
James Chamanga, drafted into the starting line-up in place of suspended captain Chris Katongo, took just one minute and 45 seconds to fire Zambia ahead.
Jacob Mulenga headed the second six minutes after the interval and Felix Katongo was quickest to a parried save to add a third just before the hour.
However, all eyes were on the first game of the day featuring title holders Egypt and serious contenders Cameroon, who have won the title four times.
The first half was one-sided with Hosni opening the scoring after 14 minutes with a penalty.
The Indomitable Lions were nowhere to be seen and fell two goals behind three minutes later when Zidan beat keeper Carlos Idriss Kameni from close range at the end of a swift counter-attack.
Worse was to come for Cameroon with Zidan giving Egypt a three-goal advantage at halftime with a wonderful shot that went under Kameni's crossbar.
Even though Cameroon coach Otto Pfister reshuffled his midfield at halftime, Egypt were simply too good for the 2002 champions.
Eto'o pulled a goal back on 51 minutes but his side's hopes were dashed nine minutes from time when Hosni scored his second with a 25-metre drive.
We are not here just to be part of the tournament, we are here to win a second successive title, Zidan told Ghanaian television channel TV3.
We give everything, we have to be in the final in Accra.
Eto'o doubled his personal tally in injury time with a penalty and is now only one goal short of the Nations Cup record of 14 set by Ivory Coast's Laurent Pokou in 1970.
Premier League Fulham were knocked out of the FA Cup by League One third division.
Fulham, second-last in the Premier League, failed to impose themselves on their supposed inferiors during 120 goalless minutes on a heavy pitch, just as they struggled in the 2-2 Craven Cottage draw in the original match.
Fulham, who have not won in their last 13 games, had defender Dejan Sefanovic sent off in extra time and went down 5-3 on penalties.
In the fourth round this weekend Rovers will visit Barnet, who upset League One Swindon after they finished 1-1 after extra time.
Swindon contrived to miss the four penalties they took in the shootout, allowing the League Two fourth division side to advance by scoring two.
Derby County, bottom of the Premier League, scraped into a fourth-round home game with Preston North End after they finished level at 1-1 after extra time against Sheffield Wednesday at a sodden Hillsborough.
Steve Watson shot Wednesday into a 10th-minute lead and they were the better side for most of the first half.
Kenny Miller equalised for Derby with a nice curler two minutes after the restart but both teams looked short of ideas as the game went into the extra 30 minutes and Derby, with only one league win to their name this season, won the shootout 4-2.
Deportivo Coruna midfielder Juan Carlos Valeron has been given the all-clear to play again after being sidelined for two years because of a series of serious knee injuries, the Primera Liga side said on Tuesday.
The 32-year-old, who has been capped 46 times for Spain, first underwent surgery after tearing the cruciate ligament in his left knee in Jan. 2006.
He returned to action six months later only to tear the ligament again while playing in a pre-season friendly.
After a second operation he was given the green light to play again in Jan. 2007 but continued to feel pain in his knee and went under the knife for a third time in March last year in an attempt to save his career.
His club Deportivo have struggled this season and are in 19th place in the 20-team Primera Liga, five points behind Real Murcia.
Steve Nash helped the Phoenix Suns overturn a nine-point, fourth-quarter deficit and post a 114-105 road victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday.
The All-Star guard scored 15 of his season-high 37 points in the final period and tallied 10 assists in total as Phoenix became the first team in the Western Conference to reach 30 wins this season.
The Suns are 30-12, second only to the Boston Celtics for the best record in the league.
Phoenix also continued their domination of Milwaukee, winning 30 of the last 34 games against the Bucks since March 28, 1991.
During that run, the Suns are 20-0 against the Bucks in Phoenix.
Amare Stoudemire had 19 points and 12 rebounds and Raja Bell also scored 19 points for the Suns, but the stage belonged to Nash.
That's what he means to us, Bell told reporters.
If he doesn't get those opportunities to score you can pretty much bank on the fact that he will find the guy who is wide open.
If teams choose to play us like that, it's fine because he is probably our best shooter.
The Suns were also bolstered by the return of Grant Hill to the starting line-up, the guard coming back less than two weeks after undergoing an appendectomy on Jan. 9.
He had eight points in 27 minutes.
Michael Redd scored 28 points for the Bucks, but could only register two in the fourth quarter.
Andrew Bogut had 19 points and 13 rebounds in the loss.
They have a couple of All-Star type players that made some plays, Milwaukee coach Larry Krystkowiak said.
Steve Nash came up huge.
It's a tough one to swallow.
Our guys really played hard.
The Sacramento Kings benefited from having their three leading players in the starting line-up for the first time this season with a 128-94 thumping of the visiting New Jersey Nets.
Ron Artest scored 27 points, Kevin Martin 19 and Mike Bibby 15 as the Kings won their third straight game.
Vince Carter had 21 points and eight assists for the Nets, who lost their sixth straight game.
Holders Chelsea will meet London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in next month's League Cup final at Wembley Stadium after beating Everton 1-0 in the second leg of their semi-final at Goodison Park on Wednesday.
Chelsea, holding a 2-1 first-leg lead, wrapped up an evenly balanced tie after 69 minutes when Joe Cole scored with a brilliant strike after a long raking pass from Florent Malouda.
Forward Cole controlled the ball superbly with his first touch before firing past goalkeeper Tim Howard from 12 metres.
Earlier Nicolas Anelka hit the Everton crossbar while Joleon Lescott went close for the home side after only 10 minutes but saw a fine header scrambled away by Chelsea keeper Petr Cech.
Cech had double reason to celebrate at the end after becoming a father for the first time earlier in the day.
He also had an outstanding game and kept Everton out with a series of fine saves from, among others, Phil Neville and Phil Jagielka as Everton, battling to reach the final for the first time since 1984, pressurised the visitors defence.
But with Ricardo Carvalho also playing superbly at the back, Chelsea held firm and gradually took control of the game.
Cole told Sky Sports: It's great to be in with a chance of winning the trophy.
They are a top side and always give us a great game.
After losing semi-finals at Liverpool before, it will be a nice flight home tonight.
Chelsea coach Avram Grant added: It was a big test of character for us, a big challenge but we played well.
Any chance of winning a trophy we'll take.
Israeli Grant, who took over from Jose Mourinho in September, has now led Chelsea to a major final in his first season in charge as has Spurs' Spanish coach Juande Ramos.
Ramos, who took over from Martin Jol in October, saw his team reach Wembley on Tuesday when they ended an eight-year winless streak against arch-rivals Arsenal, thumping them 5-1 at White Hart Lane to earn a 6-2 aggregate triumph.
While Chelsea will be in the final for the third time in four seasons, Spurs have reached their first final since 2002 when they lost to Blackburn Rovers in Cardiff.
Chelsea have won the trophy four times in 1965, 1998, 2005 and last year when they also won the FA Cup. Spurs victories came in 1971, 1973 and 1999.
The only other occasion Chelsea and Tottenham have met in a major final was in 1967 when Spurs won 2-1 in the first all-London FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium.
They were due to meet at White Hart Lane in a Premier League match on Feb. 23 but instead will face each other in the first League Cup final at the new Wembley the following day.
Olympique Lyon bounced back from two defeats in a row with a 2-0 home win over Lorient on Wednesday that put the six-times champions six points clear at the top of Ligue 1.
Lyon, who had worried their fans last week with a 1-0 League Cup quarter-final defeat at Le Mans followed by a 3-0 league thrashing at Racing Lens, recaptured their winning ways thanks to a goal in each half from Hatem Ben Arfa and Karim Benzema.
Ben Arfa opened the scoring from 20 metres on 29 minutes and fellow 20-year-old France forward Benzema wrapped it up in the 74th, scoring his 14th league goal this season from the edge of the box.
Coach Alain Perrin's team moved to 45 points from 22 games, six ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux, who were entertaining St Etienne on Wednesday.
Third-placed Nancy dropped eight points off the pace after a 1-1 home draw with Olympique Marseille.
Midfielder Jonathan Brison put Nancy ahead from a free kick early in the second half but the visitors equalised with a late volley from France playmaker Samir Nasri.
Lens had earlier moved out of relegation zone with a 2-1 win at 10-man Valenciennes after substitute Kevin Monnet-Paquet got the winner.
Forward Steve Savidan opened the scoring for the home side after 33 minutes but Lens levelled with a header from Brazilian defender Hilton just before halftime.
Valenciennes defender Guillaume Rippert was sent off in the 57th minute for blocking forward Monnet-Paquet, who scored six minutes later to wrap up the points for Lens.
Lens climb two spots to 16th in the 20-strong league, with Valenciennes, who conceded their first home defeat of the season, dropping a place to seventh.
Two impressive long-range shots in the final minutes gave Tunisia and South Africa draws in their opening African Nations Cup Group D games in Tamale on Wednesday
Mejdi Traoui fired in a 30-metre drive under Tony Sylva's crossbar seven minutes from time to give 2004 champions Tunisia a 2-2 draw against Senegal.
Later on Wednesday, substitute Elrio van Heerden netted with a superb, curling shot from 22 metres with two minutes remaining to give 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa a 1-1 draw with Angola at the Tamale Sports Stadium.
Senegal appeared to be cruising to victory when Diomansy Kamara put them in front in the 66th minute following a free kick from the right.
But with six minutes left, the ball fell to Traoui, who scored with a shot which flew into the top right hand corner.
Tunisia had opened the scoring through forward Issam Jomaa on nine minutes with Moustapha Bayal Sall equalising on the stroke of halftime.
Tunisia's coach Roger Lemerre walked out of the post-match media conference as Senegalese journalists fought amongst themselves, causing bedlam in the interview room.
In the following game, Manucho headed Angola in front on the half hour.
Fielding an experimental team in their bid to give younger players more experience for 2010, South Africa had the ball in the net shortly before their equaliser but a goal was disallowed for offside.
Angola goalkeeper Lama denied South Africa an injury-time winner when he parried a shot from outside the area.
The tournament returns to Accra's Ohene Djan stadium on Thursday when hosts Ghana take on Namibia and Morocco play Guinea.
Barcelona star Ronaldinho will be back in action from next week, meaning he should be fit to take his place in the Spanish Cup quarter-final return with Villareal, the club said Thursday.
The player is currently in the final stages of his physical rehabilitation and the pain in his left knee has gone, as a result of which he will be ready to play next week, the Catalan club said in a statement.
All the tests undertaken have given good results.
Ronaldinho has not played in 2008 owing to tendonitis in the knee and Barca have suffered over the six matches he has been away, with Real Madrid moving seven points clear in La Liga.
Boston Celtics forward Kevin Garnett topped the voting for the NBA all-star game line-ups announced on Thursday.
Garnett, who will be appearing in his 11th all-star game received over 2.3 million votes, pipping LeBron James of Cleveland who will be the other forward on the Eastern Conference starting team, to be coached by Boston's Doc Rivers.
Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant led the Western Conference voting with just over two million votes.
Bryant became the youngest all-star in NBA history in 1998 and he will team up with Denver Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony, making his first career start in the showcase game.
Chinese center Yao Ming of Houston is the only non-American player named as a starter for the 57th edition of the game, which will be played at the New Orleans Arena on Feb 17.
Claude Makelele is ready to step into midfield again on Saturday to try and help Chelsea past Wigan Athletic and into the fifth round of the FA Cup.
Chelsea travel to the JJB Stadium with confidence after booking a League Cup final clash against Tottenham, thanks to their midweek success at Everton.
However, they have Michael Essien, Didier Drogba, Salomon Kalou and John Obi Mikel at the African Nations Cup while John Terry, Frank Lampard, Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko all have injuries and are expected to miss out on Saturday.
Branislav Ivanovic is likely to make his debut, but one man who will become more important than usual is Makelele.
All the time I've been careful and I have had a good conversation with the manager and he knows me, Makelele explained.
He knows that I don't have the need to play all the time and he has good young players - John Obi Mikel, Michael Essien - who need more time for playing.
I am here for some games.
The manager knows I am here for the team when my experience is wanted.
When I do my job I am thinking about the team, not myself.
Chelsea have conceded just one goal in their last four games, all of which they have won.
But Wigan are in good form too, losing just one of their last four matches.
Wigan manager Steve Bruce admits he has concerns about the state of the pitch at the JJB Stadium ahead of this weekend's encounter.
I know we have had some unbelievable weather recently and it doesn't seem to have stopped raining, but the pitch is a concern, said Bruce.
If you are a Premier League team, you need a decent pitch and that could certainly affect us.
Forward Emile Heskey is out of the clash due to a back injury but is expected to recover for the Premier League trip to Middlesbrough next Tuesday.
One man who is expected to keep his place in the side, however, is defender Titus Bramble.
He made a mistake in their last match against Everton, allowing Andrew Johnson to open the scoring as the Toffees went on to record a victory.
Times are tough at Wigan as they battle against relegation, but this fixture gives them some respite from league troubles.
Titus has had to cope with this sort of thing before, and he is strong mentally which he needs to be, said Bruce.
All players make mistakes, but it is how they respond which matters.
In the second half against Everton, I thought he gave a towering display.
Holder Nadia Petrova of Russia made an early exit from the Paris Open when Ukraine's Kateryna Bondarenko beat her 7-6 3-6 6-4 in the first round on Tuesday.
Petrova, seeded fifth at the indoor event, had her chances and opened up a 4-2 lead in the third set but showed signs of nerves at crucial moments.
Bondarenko hit a forehand wide on the first match point but on the second Petrova netted a forehand to bow out after two hours and 25 minutes.
Two-times champion Amelie Mauresmo delighted the home crowd by outplaying American qualifier Julie Ditty 6-1 6-2 in just 56 minutes in the day's last match.
Former world number one Mauresmo, who lost in the third round of last month's Asutralian Open, decided not to play Fed Cup in order to concentrate on her preparations for the Paris tournament.
Without her, France lost to China in a quarter-final tie in Beijing at the weekend.
Hungary Agnes Szavay, seeded seventh, also advanced comfortably, crushing Olga Govortsova of Belarus 6-1 6-1.
The top four seeds have a first-round bye and enter the tournament from Wednesday.
Thailand suffered a double blow on Tuesday on the eve of their World Cup qualifying match against Japan when they learned two of their players could not play because of accumulated bookings.
Thailand coach Chanvit Phalajivin was surprised to learn that he could not use midfielder Datsakorn Thonglao or Manchester City FC defender Suree Sukha because of the number of yellow cards they had picked up in previous matches.
I didn't receive any information from either Asian Football Confederation or FIFA world football's governing body before.
They told me today.
If I cannot use them, I wouldn't have brought them to Japan, said Chanvit after an official training session at the Saitama stadium, near Tokyo.
Thailand played the first and second qualifying rounds, while Japan didn't, so they have no accumulated yellow cards.
Do you think it's fair? We submitted the list of players a month ago.
The Thai players also have to battle against cold weather conditions, which Chanvit admitted were a major disadvantage.
I must say we are not used to the cold weather.
It gives an advantage to the Japanese players.
I also admit that Japan are number one in Asia, a better team than Thailand, said Chanvit.
Of course, it's difficult to beat them, but anything is possible if you do your best.
Maybe we can cause a surprise.
I really want to take three points from a win.
Japan coach Takeshi Okada is confident that his players can cope with the Thai tactics on Wednesday whether they pressure his side or play defensively.
We did everything in our preparation and now it's the time that my players fight on the pitch, said Okada.
It's mentally important to win the first game and it's always difficult to play the first game, but otherwise, it's the same as the second or third game.
I know Thailand studied us and analysed our tactics.
Ghana striker Junior Agogo has received an unusual offer from an 82-year-old fan in appreciation of his exploits at the African Nations Cup semi-final - his granddaughter.
The proposal was made after the Nottingham Forest forward's late winner in the 2-1 success over Nigeria which put the hosts into Thursday's semi-final with Cameroon.
Agogo, who also scored the only goal to beat Namibia in the first round, was approached by the octagenarian fan at the team's hotel 24 hours after Sunday's quarter-final win.
The man, who gave his name as Nana, told the Ghana star: I came here last night with my very beautiful granddaughter to introduce her to you.
She is not here with me now because she wanted to pick something from town.
Son, when she comes, she is all yours.
According to the report on The Daily Graphic's online site on Tuesday the 28-year-old forward took the proposition in his stride, telling the elderly Black Stars supporter: Thank you very much, I appreciate that and I am waiting to see her.
Former Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu became a senator for the opposition party the Social Democrats on Tuesday.
The 57-year-old guided Romania to the 1994 World Cup quarter-finals and admitted that back then he would never have thought he would become a senator.
In 1994, I would never have imagined that one day I would be a senator, said Iordanescu, who takes over the senatorial seat of Ilfov, north of Bucharest.
Iordanescu, who played for Steaua Bucharest from 1968 to 1982 and was capped 64 times for Romania, scoring 26 goals, has enjoyed an up-and-down coaching career.
He was assistant coach when Steaua won the European Cup in 1986 and then took over the reins till 1990.
He has twice been national coach, the first spell from 1993-1998 when apart from the quarter-final appearance in the 1994 World Cup, Romania went out in the first round of Euro '96 and the second round of the 1998 World Cup.
He was recalled as national coach when former playing great Gheorghe Hagi failed to guide the side into the 2002 World Cup, but Iordanescu was let go when they failed to qualify for the Euro 2004 finals.
Since then he coached Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad and Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates.
A stylish Italy beat Portugal 3-1 on a night of friendly matches between Euro 2008 rivals that left tournament co-hosts Switzerland and Austria among the losers on Wednesday.
While the world champions were thrilling the crowd in Zurich, Switzerland lost 2-1 to non-qualifiers England in a winning start for new Italian boss Fabio Capello at Wembley Stadium.
Austria had Germany on the ropes for the first 45 minutes at Vienna's Ernst Happel stadium before Thomas Hitzlsperger blasted the ball in from the edge of the box after 53 minutes to set Germany on their way to a 3-0 win.
The Netherlands beat Croatia, tipped by many as dark horses for the tournament after an impressive qualifying run, by the same scoreline in Split.
Spain beat 2006 World Cup finalists France 1-0 in Malaga thanks to a late goal from left back Joan Capdevila in another high profile dress rehearsal for the June tournament.
It was only the second time Spain have beaten France, who face Italy in Euro 2008 Group C along with the Netherlands and Romania, in their last 11 meetings.
The only disappointment for the home side came just before kickoff when Barcelona forward Bojan Krkic, 17, missed a chance to become Spain's youngest cap after he suffered a recurrence of stomach problems.
Italy shone with goals from Luca Toni, Fabio Cannavaro and Fabio Quagliarella while winger Ricardo Quaresma scored for Portugal.
This national team has grown very much and we don't want to lose even these matches. That shows we are mature, said Cannavaro.
Midfielder Jermaine Jenas made another Italian happy when he scored the first goal of England's new era after 40 minutes, finding the net with a first-time left foot shot after superb work down the left from Joe Cole.
Switzerland equalised when debutant Eren Derdiyok, a halftime substitute, scored with a left-foot shot on the turn after 58 minutes but England substitute Shaun Wright-Phillips made it 2-1 four minutes later.
Austria did not even have the consolation of a goal despite a promising first half display.
Miroslav Klose made it 2-0 to Germany with his 37th international goal in the 63rd minute and substitute Mario Gomez headed home the third 10 minutes from time.
The Netherlands coasted to an impressive victory in Split with goals from John Heitinga, Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink.
The match was Croatia's first since they beat England 3-2 at Wembley in November and continued the country's winless record in the Adriatic city since independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
I can only congratulate the Dutch, they were the better team and deserved to win.
We let in very soft goals and gave away possession far too easily, said Croatia coach Slaven Bilic.
In other matches between Euro 2008 finalists, Turkey and Sweden played out a goalless draw in front of 20,000 spectators in Istanbul while Poland beat the Czech Republic 2-0 in Cyprus.
Romania stumbled in their preparations when they lost 1-0 to Israel in Tel Aviv after midfielder Ovidiu Petre was sent off in the 22nd minute.
Omer Golan scored the only goal from a Moshe Ohayon corner three minutes later.
European champions Greece scored twice in the space of five minutes in the second half to beat non-qualifiers Finland 2-1 in Cyprus.
Nathalie Dechy, Virginie Razzano and Alize Cornet helped ease their Fed Cup misery as the trio of home hopes advanced to the second round of the WTA tournament here on Wednesday.
Dechy ousted China's Peng Shuai in straight sets as Razzano needed three sets to get past eighth-seeded Alona Bondarenko of the Ukraine.
Peng, 22, had been a key player in China's 3-2 World Group success over France at the weekend when she gave the hosts their first point with a surprise win over Razzano in Beijing.
But the French proved they are masters at home with Dechy beating Peng, and Razzano coming away winner at the Pierre de Coubertin stadium.
They were later joined by teenager Cornet who got past Czech qualifier Klara Zakopalova.
It was revenge even if it doesn't make up for the defeat at the weekend, said wild card Dechy, who lost her doubles tie with Razzano in China.
Peng missed her chance to force a third set as she threw away a 6-1 lead in the tie-break.
I thought it was going to be a third set.
So I said to myself 'you have to give it everything you have', said a jet-lagged Dechy.
Peng admitted: I never had that happen in a tie-break before - being 6-1 up.
I tried to fight but didn't have the confidence on the court today.
People were supporting her but that wasn't really part of it.
They played in China and that was very difficult for them as well.
Dechy, ranked 64th, looked in command early in her first meeting against 50th-ranked Peng, wrapping up the first set with two breaks.
But Dechy, making her 11th appearance in Paris, showed signs of fatigue in the second, being broken as she served for the match at 5-3, with Peng winning three games in a row before the French player broke back to force a tense tie-break.
The 28-year-old Dechy next meets top-seeded Russian Anna Chakvetadze, the recipient of a first round bye.
Razzano, meanwhile, had a tougher time getting past Bondarenko despite coasting through the first set.
She received courtside treatment for her aching back and thigh muscles twice in the third set before achieving her first win in three meetings with the Ukrainian after just over two hours.
I obviously feel very tired.
I had three big matches this weekend, said Razzano.
I'm satisfied and proud of myself to have won despite the suffering.
She next meets Cornet, 18, who also needed two hours to advance to the second round for the first time after making her debut last year.
Fellow French players Amelie Mauresmo, the sixth seed, and Marion Bartoli, seeded third, have also qualified for the second round.
Seven soccer players from former club Liaoning Guangyuan have been charged with match-fixing, the Singaporean league said on Wednesday.
The Chinese club, who played just one season in Singapore, was kicked out at the end of the 2007 season.
Nobody at the club was immediately available for comment.
S.League CEO Winston Lee said that if found guilty, the league would call for worldwide life bans for the seven.
Match-fixing is a serious offence and a threat to the credibility of the game, he said in a statement.
If they are guilty, we hope that the punishment meted out will send out a strong message that there is no place for corruption in football here.
Anyone that falls foul of the law here will have to bear the severe consequences of their actions.
The players have already been suspended from all forms of football activities in Singapore and they will be permanently banned should they be found guilty, he added
The Singapore Football Association will also be recommending to AFC and FIFA to extend their life bans worldwide should that be the case.
Asia has long been blighted by soccer corruption scandals.
Last year, a Vietnamese court sentenced four soccer referees to jail for bribery and match-fixing.
In November, Interpol uncovered $680 million worth of illegal soccer betting across Asia after a series of raids.
Planning for the raids took place from June and was timed to match the start of major soccer seasons, with illegal betting found in all the participating countries: Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
Spain snatched a 1-0 win over World Cup finalists France thanks to a late goal from left back Joan Capdevila in a Euro 2008 warm-up on Wednesday.
France dominated for most of a tactical and conservative friendly, but the game burst into life when Capdevila put Spain in front snapping in a rebound from close range 10 minutes from time.
Thierry Henry had two great chances to equalise but his first flew wide of the post and his second was blocked by the ever alert Spain keeper Iker Casillas.
It was only the second time Spain have beaten France in their last 11 meetings, a victory that compensated for an otherwise unfortunate evening for the home side.
Barcelona forward Bojan Krkic missed his chance to become Spain's youngest cap when he suffered a recurrence of stomach problems shortly before kickoff, while striker Fernando Torres and defender Angel both went off injured.
It's frustrating when you see our performance.
We could at least not have lost, said France coach Raymond Domenech.
It's a shame because we played the way I wanted, the way I expected us to do, he told reporters.
I'm pleased because we created some opportunities.
France looked the better side in the first half, gaining the upper hand in midfield and carrying more of a threat up front.
Striker Nicolas Anelka cracked a fierce shot just wide of the post in the opening minutes and then forced a great one-handed save from Casillas with another angled effort.
Spain rarely threatened Gregory Coupet's goal, their only real chance coming when midfielder Xavi lashed a curling free kick into the side netting on 13 minutes.
Their attacking power was further diminished when Torres was forced off with what looked like a thigh strain midway through the half.
France continued to dominate after the break but failed to take advantage and Capdevila gave Spain the lead when he stabbed home from two metres after midfielder Lassana Diarra had headed a fierce Andres Iniesta shot off the line.
In a frantic final few minutes, France substitute Karim Benzema hit the bar with a powerful header and Henry sliced wide with his follow-up and then had an injury-time chance blocked by Casillas.
France are a very difficult side to play against and neither team had many chances, said Spain coach Luis Aragones.
After the goal we lost control of the ball and we were lucky not to concede one ourselves.
Norway's Petter Solberg, driving a Subaru Impreza, topped the time charts in the opening super-special stage of the Rally of Sweden on Thursday.
World champion Sebastien Loeb, who won the season-opener in Monte Carlo last month, was fourth fastest over the 1.9km course at the Karlstad racecourse in his Citroen.
The Frenchman, just 1.1sec behind 2003 world champion Solberg.
Has reached another milestone here as he and co-driver Daniel Elena are competing in their 100th rally together.
The Ford Focus duo of Jari-Matti Latvala and Mikko Hirvonen were in second and third-place respectively on a treacherous super-special stage.
Australia's Chris Atkinson, who was third in Monte-Carlo, came off worst.
His Subaru Impreza stalled on the start line and he lost precious seconds as a result.
Atkinson finished 7.3secs behind his teammate.
The first full day of the race is on Friday with seven stages.
Loeb's Spanish teammate Dani Sordo faces a tough examination this weekend after being penalised five minutes for changing the engine in his Citroen after the race in Monte Carlo.
Malaysian badminton clubs may soon be forced to pay transfer fees after former All England champion Hafiz Hashim abruptly switched teams because of financial problems, local media reported on Friday.
Hafiz quit financially troubled professional team Nusa Mahsur after nine years to join KLRC because he was unhappy the club was unable to add to the $170 monthly allowance he receives from the Badminton Association of Malaysia BAM.
BAM President Nadzmi Salleh told the New Straits Times newspaper that it would look at introducing the transfer fees to compensate clubs for developing players before they moved on.
There must be a guideline if a player wants to leave after enjoying the benefits for several years.
We are looking into introducing transfer fees, Nadzmi was quoted as saying.
Hafiz's BAM allowance, which is paid as part of the national body's package to players who qualify for the Beijing Olympics, was reduced from $780 last October due to a run of poor results.
Hafiz, who won the All England title in 2003, has failed to reach the semi-finals of a major international tournament in more than a year.
I was told that $170 was sufficient because as an elite player I was given accommodation and food, Hafiz had told The Star newspaper earlier.
But I am married now and I have more responsibilities.
No one seemed to understand this.
I trained as hard as anyone else but I did not get what I was due.
Little-known American Kent Jones upstaged some of the biggest names in the game by charging one stroke clear in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am first round on Thursday.
The 41-year-old journeyman from New Mexico fired a six-under-par 66 in relatively benign conditions at Pebble Beach Golf Links, one of three venues being used this week.
John Mallinger carded a 67 at Poppy Hills to lie one off the pace, level with fellow Americans Roland Thatcher and Tour rookie Brad Adamonis, who both opened at Spyglass Hill.
Long-hitting J.B. Holmes, who won last week's Phoenix Open in a playoff with Phil Mickelson, was among a group of 10 bunched on 68 after starting out at Spyglass Hill.
Jones, who improved his status on the PGA Tour by tying for 11th at last year's qualifying school, birdied his first two holes in glorious sunshine to reach the turn in four-under 32.
He rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt at the par-four fourth, his 13th hole of the day, before picking up another stroke at the par-three seventh, where he hit his tee shot to six feet.
But I didn't expect to putt as well as I did today, that is a surprise, added Jones, whose best PGA Tour finish was a tie for sixth at the 2006 Lumber Classic.
A Real Madrid fan was stabbed before the Champions League last 16 first-leg match with AS Roma on Tuesday, Italian media said.
The young fan was taken to hospital suffering from cuts to his backside after the incident in a square, the ambulance service was quoted as saying.

Spaniard David Ferrer, seeded three, also advanced with a 6-4 7-5 victory over Italy's Simone Bolelli but eighth-seeded Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis was beaten 6-3 3-6 6-4 by Swede Robin Soderling.
I wasn't feeling well today and needed more time to get adapted to the surface which is much slower than Marseille last week, world number 21 Baghdatis told reporters.
I really wanted to win because I am sure I would have felt better further on in the tournament.
Dutchman Raemon Sluiter, who said he would retire when his involvement in this tournament ended, bowed out as he lost 6-1 7-6 to Michael Llodra of France.
Olga Govortsova of Belarus was handed a second-round clash against top seed Ana Ivanovic when Indian opponent Sania Mirza was forced to retire with cramp in the third set of their match on Tuesday.
Govortsova, the world number 50, lost the opening set 6-4 and saved two match points in the second before taking it 7-5 in a tiebreak.
She went 3-2 up in the third when Mirza called a halt to the match.
I felt it in my left calf and it was the worst time because I had just broken her and I was serving for the match, Mirza, who first felt the problem at 4-4 in the second, told reporters.
Then my left hamstring started going, then my groin and right calf and I couldn't move.
I couldn't go down on my serve anymore because my calf wouldn't let me.
Marion Bartoli, seeded eight, suffered a 6-2 6-3 defeat by 17-year old Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark in the second round, continuing her run of indifferent results since she reached the 2007 Wimbledon final.

The news that Berti Vogts had on Wednesday quit with immediate effect as Nigeria coach has been welcomed by many involved in football in the country.
Vogts resigned from his post less than three weeks after the team crashed out in the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations.
A statement issued by his lawyers said that the German coach took the action because the measures and the behaviour of the Nigerian Football Association during and after the African Cup have led to a loss of confidence concerning further cooperation.
Further cooperation is impossible.
Tukur Babangida, chairman of Premier League club side, Kano Pillars FC, welcomed the news of the 61-year-old's departure.
It is a welcome development that he left honourably, he said.
Vogts had shown that he had nothing to offer Nigeria.
It is good that he left without waiting to be dragged to FIFA or to CAF
Garba Ubaliyo, a former NFA board member, said he had long expected Vogt's resignation, as did Alhassan Yakmut, the acting Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Football League.
Who added that Vogts surprised him by waiting this long before throwing in the towel.
Ubaliyo blamed the NFA for the situation that led to Nigeria recording its worst outing at the Nations Cup finals in 26 years with the 2-1 quarter-final loss to hosts Ghana on February 3.
If after our outing at the France '98 World Cup finals, we had kept to continuity, things won't have been like this.
We have never put things in order, he said.
The former Yobe State Director of Sports in Nigeria's north suggested that it was time the NFA started to look closer to home for a new coach.
We should start grooming our own coaches to be able to take over permanently.
Look at Egypt, they had a local coach who looked inward and used mostly players from the local league to achieve success, he said.
Look at their team, it is one to watch out for in the next few years.
Ray Nnaji, a member of the Nigeria Football League board, called for the employment of one out of Stephen Keshi, Samson Siasia or former Super Eagles captain Sunday Oliseh, as replacement for Vogts.
Anyone of these ex-internationals can do the job.
But if they still insist on a foreign coach, I think Clemens Westerhof will be a better option, Nnaji said.
Vogts was in charge of Nigeria since January 2007 on a deal valid until the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
He has also coached Germany, Kuwait and Scotland in the past, winning the Euro 1996 title with Germany.
Ernie Els became the first big name to fall by the wayside when he was crushed 6&5 by American Jonathan Byrd in the opening round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Wednesday.
The South African world number four bogeyed four of the first nine holes before losing the match on the 13th green.
Byrd, world-ranked 63rd, reeled off six birdies in a flawless display at Dove Mountain's Gallery Golf Club.
The 30-year-old American, a three-times winner on the PGA Tour, is making his debut in the first World Golf Championships event of the year.
Medical staff in Paris say three-time former world footballer of the year Ronaldo should be able to leave the clinic which operated on his left knee by the end of the week.
The 31-year-old AC Milan striker last Thursday underwent surgery at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris on the tendon ruptured in his club's 1-1 draw against Livorno at the San Siro the day before.
And a medical official told AFP on Wednesday: He won't be leaving on Thursday, it's more likely to be Friday.
Ronaldo is due to remain in Paris for physiotherapy for another 10 days before returning to Milan to continue treatment.
Arsenal will have to do it the hard way if they are to advance in the Champions League after being held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by AC Milan in Wednesday's last 16 first leg.
Arsene Wenger's side found it impossible to breach Milan's resolute rearguard despite dominating most of a tense tie at the Emirates Stadium.
This was billed as a battle between Arsenal's emerging young prodigies and Milan's aging maestros.
It was Carlo Ancelotti's old stagers who finished more satisfied after giving a masterclass in the art of defending.
A score-draw in the San Siro in three weeks time would still be enough to send Arsenal through, but that will be a daunting task against the reigning European champions.
However, star Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas believes that Arsenal showed enough to suggest they could dethrone the holders.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs failed to get victories on their 100th Champions League matches on Wednesday but both can still dream of a place in the last eight.
Arsenal were held 0-0 at home by holders AC Milan while United grabbed a late goal through Carlos Tevez to draw 1-1 with six-time French champions Lyon in France.
The two Spanish sides involved in the action both had five goal thrillers.
A double by Argentinian star Lionel Messi and one from former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry saw Barcelona come from behind twice to beat Celtic 3-2 in Glasgow while two-time UEFA Cup titleholders Sevilla lost 3-2 to Fenerbahce in Istanbul.
Wenger was still happy with the result even though the Gunners missed a host of chances, none more so than when on fire Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor saw his header come off the bar.
We didn't take advantage of our many chances but overall I am very happy with the response shown by the team to the 4-0 FA Cup defeat by Manchester United.
The second leg should also be an open game, it is only a shame we can't transfer our pitch over there.
Wenger, whose previous Champions league involvement came as former manager of Monaco, wasn't even fazed by the fact that no English club has beaten AC Milan at the San Siro.
Well we beat Inter Milan there, smiled the 58-year-old Frenchman.
AC Milan handler Carlo Ancelotti admitted his side could play a lot better with Brazilian playmaker Kaka all but muzzled by the Arsenal defence.
We can show a lot more than we did here tonight, said the former AC Milan and Italy midfielder.
We were pretty tense and not in the best condition physically.
It is nonetheless a good result heading into the second leg, but nothing is certain against a team of real quality like Arsenal.
Lyon manager Alain Perrin admitted that the Tevez strike - which fell to him somewhat fortuitously off Brazilian striker Fred - had been a real blow.
Unfortunately we couldn't hold out to the end and now we are behind having conceded the away goal, said the former Marseille boss, who is rumoured to have fallen out both with the coaching and playing staff.
United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was both delighted with the result and to have something to complain about - in this case claims that Portuguese wing Cristiano Ronaldo had had a laser shone in his eyes in the warm-up before the match.
I am delighted to get the draw and it gives us a a good chance to qualify, said Ferguson.
I think it was a setback to lose the goal as at that moment we were in control.
We filed a complaint to UEFA over the Ronaldo incident, he added.
Barcelona assistant coach Johan Neeskens said that the result against Celtic was the one they had hoped for and was especially proud that they had cracked the fortress the Scottish side had built up at home.
We're happy with the result as no-one has beaten Celtic in Glasgow in the 
Champions League since we did almost four years ago, said Neeskens, who stood in for coach Frank Rijkaard as he was serving a touchline ban.
His Celtic counterpart Gordon Strachan was left seething with a display which he said was not up to the standards required.
It might have been a great game to watch for the neutrals but not for me, said the Scot.
When you're playing one of the best teams in the world you need a bit of luck and nine or 10 of your players to be at their peak.
We had neither and to have had a chance we needed to pass the ball better.
We kept giving the ball away and that meant we needed to do a lot of chasing, became tired and made mistakes.
The positives are we scored two goals against one of the best teams in the world but we lost two silly goals and lost the game.
Tiger Woods stayed on course for an eighth title in nine starts worldwide in Thursday's second round at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship as second seed Phil Mickelson was knocked out.
World number one Woods sealed a comfortable 3&2 win over fellow American Arron Oberholser but left-hander Mickelson was beaten by 31st-seeded Stuart Appleby of Australia 2&1.
Twice champion Woods, who fought back from three down with five holes remaining to edge big-hitting J.B. Holmes the previous day, rattled up five birdies in a flawless display.
The 32-year-old won the opening hole after Oberholser ended up in an unplayable lie in the desert scrub with his second shot and retained control for the rest of the match at Dove Mountain's Gallery Golf Club.
I played a lot better today.
hit the ball well and even made a couple of putts early on, Woods told reporters.
I never gave Arron a hole.
He had to earn the holes and I didn't make a bogey today.
Match play is an animal that's all about the moment, you'd better get off to a quick start and never give holes away.
Woods, tournament champion at La Costa in 2003 and 2004, will face Aaron Baddeley in the third round, the Australian having gained a bye after the withdrawal of American David Toms due to a back injury.
Mickelson charged two up after eagling the par-five fifth but Appleby hit back with four birdies round the turn before sealing victory on the 17th green.
A resurgent Colin Montgomerie drew on Ryder Cup inspiration to edge American Charles Howell III in a tight, fluctuating encounter.
The 44-year-old Briton, who eliminated world number seven Jim Furyk in the opening round, came from one down with five holes to play with three late birdies.
I am delighted with the win, a smiling Montgomerie said.

Bayern Munich captain Oliver Kahn has warned Hamburg his side are approaching top form ahead of their Bundesliga clash at the Allianz Arena on Sunday.
Kahn, who will retire from German league football at the end of the season, says Bayern are approaching their peak after beating Hanover 3-0 last Sunday and the league leaders are looking for three more points.
Both sides have had less than three days to recover from Thursday's UEFA Cup last 32 fixtures after Hamburg drew 0-0 with Swiss side FC Zurich while Bayern hammered Aberdeen 5-1.
For Hamburg coach Huub Stevens this will be the last time he can get one over his old adversary Ottmar Hitzfeld, with Bayern's boss set to leave this summer to coach the Swiss national team, and this will be the 16th time the two have faced each other in Bundesliga matches.
Stevens, whose side are third in the league, has coached his team to a win over Hitzfeld's teams on four occasions, with eight losses and three draws.
The last came in September when the two sides drew 1-1 at the HSH Nordbank Arena and Kahn wants another win.
We've sent out a very strong signal, said Kahn in the wake of last Sunday's victory over Hanover when Luca Toni struck a hat-trick.
I think that was tactically one of our best matches of the season, a team performance par excellence.

Feyenoord coach Bert van Marwijk has agreed a two-year contract from July 1 to succeed Marco van Basten as coach of the Netherlands, the Dutch football association said on Monday.
Van Basten, who took charge in 2004, had said after the Dutch qualified for Euro 2008 that he would step down following the June tournament in Switzerland and Austria.
He will take over as coach of Ajax Amsterdam next season.
We are pleased with this agreement as Bert was on our shortlist from the beginning, KNVB director Henk Kessler said in a statement.
He made his name on a domestic level but also internationally.
Now we will handle the final details about the composition of the technical staff.

As a coach, he spent two years with Sittard before joining Feyenoord in 2000 and going on to win the UEFA Cup with the Rotterdam side in 2002.
He moved to Borussia Dortmund in 2004 but was sacked in December 2006 before returning to Feyenoord in June the following year.
His new task will be to steer the Dutch to the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa.
This is the highest level you can reach as coach, said the Van Marwijk in the statement.
It is a fantastic prospect and a big challenge to work with the best Dutch players.
I am pleased that the players and board of Feyenoord allowed me to take this job.
But now I want to focus on Feyenoord as the coming weeks will be crucial.
That is my obligation to the club.
According to media reports, Van Marwijk will be assisted by Dick Voorn, who worked with him at Fortuna Sittard, Borussia Dortmund and Feyenoord.
Former internationals Frank de Boer and Phillip Cocu are tipped to complete the technical staff.
Arsenal sent holders Milan packing from the Champions League on Tuesday as the English Premier League leaders booked a quarter-final place with a 2-0 win at the San Siro.
Manchester United and Barcelona made smooth progress while Turkish surprise package Fenerbahce sneaked through on penalties after their first knockout round, second-leg match against Sevilla finished at 5-5.
Goals from Cesc Fabregas and Emmanuel Adebayor guided Arsenal to victory in Milan, the first by an English side against the Rossoneri at the San Siro.
English champions United were made to work hard for a 1-0 win over Olympique Lyon at Old Trafford that gave them a 2-1 aggregate victory over the French side after Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 30th goal of the season.
Barcelona completed a 4-2 aggregate win over Celtic with a 1-0 second leg win at the Nou Camp thanks to an early goal from Xavi while Fenerbahce were indebted to goalkeeper Volkan Demirel for saving three spot-kicks in the shootout.
Demirel, at fault for at least one goal in regular time, turned hero by denying Julien Escude, Enzo Maresca and Daniel Alves in the shootout Fenerbahce won 3-2.
Alves and Seydou Keita had given Sevilla a 2-0 lead in the opening 10 minutes but goals from Brazilian striker Deivid either side of Frederic Kanoute's strike made it 3-2 on the night to force a dramatic ending to the contest.
Milan dominated the opening stages of a titanic tussle but Arsenal quickly found their feet and always looked more likely to score before Fabregas finally broke the deadlock with a stunning strike in the 84th minute.
The midfielder took the ball in his stride and beat Zeljko Kalac in goal with a rasping low shot from 30 metres that crept into the bottom right corner before Adebayor sealed the win from close range in injury time.
The Togo striker was left with a simple tap-in at the far post to score his first Champions League goal of the season after substitute Theo Walcott delivered a perfect low cross.
Manchester United did not look particularly impressive in a 4-5-1 formation with Rooney on his own up front and survived several nervy moments before and after Ronaldo netted his sixth goal of the competition and his 80th in a United shirt.
The winger pounced on a rebound from Anderson's initial effort and threaded his shot past Gregory Coupet in the 41st minute as United equalled the record held by Juventus of 10 straight Champions League home wins.
China's Zi Yan dismissed eighth seed Maria Kirilenko 3-6 7-6 6-1 in a thrilling opening match to reach the second round of the Bangalore Open on Tuesday.

Yan, ranked 54 in singles and 13 in doubles, jumped to a 3-0 lead in the decider and kept the pressure on Kirilenko.
The ball jumps higher on this court, it took me time to adjust, said Yan, who will meet Olga Savchuk of Ukraine next.
I changed my tactics in the second set and played longer points, said the Chinese, who saved a match point at 5-4 in the second set. 
That gave me momentum, she added.
World number 21 Vera Zvonareva quelled an early challenge from Romanian qualifier Monica Niculescu.

Fenerbahce beat Sevilla 3-2 on penalties to make the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time after drawing 5-5 on aggregate on Tuesday.
Goalkeeper Volkan Demirel saved three spot kicks to send the Turks through after Zico's side had survived a dreadful start at the Sanchez Pizjuan.
Sevilla, who had lost 3-2 in the first leg, stormed into a two-goal lead inside nine minutes with goals from Daniel Alves and Seydou Keita.
Fenerbahce pulled one back through Deivid midway through the first half only for Sevilla to strike again just before the break when Frederic Kanoute restored the two-goal cushion.
Deivid scored again in the 79th to force extra-time, but penalties were needed to separate the sides
It's a bitter blow because we failed to kill off the game when we were 2-0 up, Sevilla coach Manolo Jimenez said.
They were two great teams who scored five goals apiece and once it went to penalties anything could have happened.
I wish Fenerbahce all the best.
Sevilla had Fenerbahce penned back from the outset and took the lead after only five minutes when the visitors conceded a free kick 25 metres out.
Brazil full back Alves powered a swerving shot goalwards and although Volkan appeared well placed to block, he could only push it inside the post.
The Turks were still reeling four minutes later when Mali's Keita drove forward in midfield to unleash another thunderbolt from all of 30 metres which flew into the top of the net with Volkan flapping once again.
Fenerbahce won their first corner after 20 minutes.
It was taken low to unmarked Brazilian forward Deivid on the edge of the area and he was able to drill a low shot through a crowded area.
The visitors were in the ascendancy when Alves chipped a ball into Kanoute in the 41st minute, and after controlling on his chest the lanky Mali striker turned to fire a deflected shot into the corner.
Fenerbahce responded quickly, laying siege to the Sevilla goal, threatening at every set piece, and Edu had a shot cleared off the line at the end of a breathless first half.
The home side were content to play on the break after the restart and held out until 11 minutes from time when their defence was exposed again from a dead-ball situation.
A free kick to the far post found Deivid in space and after his first shot hit the post, he had time to score from the rebound to send the game into extra time.
Sevilla dominated the last few minutes but were unable to avoid the game going to penalties.
Where Volkan made up for his earlier errors denying Julien Escude, Enzo Maresca and finally captain Alves.
Peter Gade, the 1999 champion from Denmark, was forced to pull out of the men's singles All-England Championships in Birmingham on Tuesday due to asthma.
The number eight seed was due to meet Singapore's Yen Hui Kendrick Lee in Wednesday's first round, but Danish coach Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen said it was not possible for him to compete.
He cannot even run 100 yards so there was no option but for him to pull out.
Singapore's Ronald Susilo, drawn against Olympic Champion and number seven seed Taufik Hidayat in the first round, also pulled out through injury.
In the women's singles, England's top hope Tracey Hallam, the world No.16, was desperately disappointed to lose her race against fitness and was another eve of championship withdrawal.
The Commonwealth Games Champion has been struggling with a thigh problem.
I pulled out of last week's German Open with the hope of being able to play in Birmingham, she explained.
It is really heartbreaking to miss the All-England.
Germany's Juliane Schenk, who was injured in her semi-final of the German Open last week, was the fourth withdrawal from the main singles draws. 
Two Indonesian top-seeded men's doubles and mix-doubles, namely Markis Kido/Hendra Setiawan and Flandy Limpele/Vita Marissa had to leave the All England tournament early after being beaten by their rivals in the first round on Wednesday night.
The world's third-seeded mix doubles Flandy/Vita failed to get the ticket for the next round after being defeated by Robert Blair/Imogen Bankier of Britain and Scotland in 29 minutes with the scores of 15-21, 16-21.
Another Indonesian mix-doubles Muhammad Rijal/Greysia Polii had also to bow to their Thai rivals, the seventh-seeded Sudket Prapakamol/Saralee Thungthongkam in a straight set 18-21, 7-21.
Indonesia also failed to leave its women's singles shuttlers in the event after three of its shuttlers, namely Maria Kristin, Adriyani Firdasari and Pia Zebadiah failed to beat their rivals.
Indonesian first singles Maria was defeated by her Malaysia's rival, the eight-seeded Wong Mew Choo 13-21, 15-21.
Adriyanti was defeated by third-seeded from China Lu Lan in a straight set, while Pia had to bow to her Taiwan's rival Cheng Shao Chieh.
Indonesian men's singles, however still have chance to get title in the tournament after they managed to beat their rivals in the first round.
Seventh-seeded Taufik Hidayat booked victory after beating his Canadian rival Andrew dabeka 21-18, 21-12 to meet with Vietnamese shuttler Nguyen Tien Minh in the second round to be held on Sunday who once beat him in the Philippines Open in 2007.
Tommy Sugiarto followed his senior's path by beating Andrew Smith of Britain 21-11, 21-19 and meet with second-seeded Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia.
Sixth-seeded Sony Dwi Kuncoro had to play three games to beat his Indonesian rival Andre Kurniawan 11-21, 21-12, 21-9.
Sony will meet with Japan's Shoji Sato 14-21, 22-20, 21-15 to get a ticket at the quarter final.
Indonesian men's singles, the eight-seeded Luluk Hadiyanto/Alvent Yulianto beat Peter Buur Steffensen/Rasmus Mangor Andersen 21-18, 21-8 to meet with Denmark's Anders Kristiansen/Simon Mollyhus to get ticket for the quarter final.
The only Indonesian mix-doubles, second-seeded Nova Widianto/Lilyana Natsir will have to meet Denmark's mix-doubles Thomas Laybourn/Kamilla Rytter Juhl to get a ticket for the quarter final.
Fernando Torres scored his second Anfield hat-trick in less than two weeks as Liverpool thrashed West Ham United 4-0 to go fourth in the Premier League on Wednesday.
The Spanish striker, who got all three in the 3-2 win over Middlesbrough on Feb. 23, was again in sparkling form while Steven Gerrard completed the scoring with a superb fourth.
With their Champions League game against Inter Milan put back to next week, Liverpool faced a test of will against a West Ham side who beat them 1-0 at Upton Park in January.
However, they looked full of conviction from the start and were rewarded with the opening goal by Torres after eight minutes when he turned in a low cross from Dirk Kuyt.
West Ham fought their way back into the game, albeit without ever looking too dangerous, until the same duo combined for the second after 61 minutes, this time Torres heading home the Dutchman's cross.
Torres was close to his hat-trick soon after when he struck the woodwork with a diving header but completed the treble in the 81st minute with a calm finish.
Gerrard rounded off a great night for Liverpool two minutes later when he burst from midfield to blast a fierce shot into the roof of the net.
The victory meant Liverpool leap-frogged city rivals Everton into fourth, worth a place in the Champions League qualifiers at the end of the season, on goal difference.
Both teams have 53 points, five clear of Aston Villa.
The two Merseyside rivals meet at Anfield on March 30.
West Ham, also beaten 4-0 by Chelsea on Saturday, remain solidly mid-table in 10th place on 40 points.
World number two Rafael Nadal is over the injury problems that affected him at the end of last year and remains confident of a strong run at the Australian Open.
The second seeded Spaniard was troubled by foot and knee injuries in 2007 but said he was fully fit for the year's first grand-slam event, which begins on Monday.
Physically, I do not have one problem, so I am very happy with that, the three-times French Open champion told reporters on Saturday.
This year I am arriving well, practicing well and I had some matches in Chennai.
So I hope will be fine for Monday.
Nadal reached the final in Chennai, beating compatriot Carlos Moya in a semi-final battle that lasted almost four hours.
The Spaniard then ran out of steam in the final the next day, losing 6-0 6-1 to Mikhail Youzhny of Russia.
I was only tired, Nadal said, shrugging off any doubts about his fitness.
It was a terrible semi-final, no? Four-hour match.
I had less than 24 hours to recover.
I went to sleep late because I finished the match late so it was tough to recover.
So Mikhail play good tennis and he beat me very easy.
I think I am prepared.
I practiced very well, very good the week before.
In Chennai, I played some tough matches.
It's important to win matches like the semi-final, important for confidence.
A quarter-finalist in Melbourne last year, Nadal will open his campaign against a qualifier on Monday.
Maria Sharapova has two grand slam titles in the bag and has attained world number one status, but the Russian still believes her best is yet to come.
The world number five, a favourite for the Jan. 14-27 Australian Open, won Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004 and believes she is still getting better.
I love the work that I put in on the court and I know that some day it will pay off, Sharapova, runner-up in Melbourne 12 months ago, told reporters on Saturday.
I've said it many times, I don't think this is the peak of my career.
I believe that there are many more years to go, and I'm going to learn from all those experiences within those years.
Sharapova said world number one Justine Henin was the big favourite and that defending champion Serena Williams and her sister Venus were also big threats for the title.
But the Russian said her never-say-die attitude would stand her in good stead over the next fortnight.
I've proven it before and I've done it before, so I don't think you can ever count me out, she said.
No matter how confident or not, no matter where my ranking is, I'm one of the toughest competitors out there.
I never leave the court without giving 100 percent, and that's why I think I gain a lot of respect from my fans and from the tennis audience.
Sharapova suffered a shoulder injury in 2007 which caused her to alter her service action, but said she felt fully fit after the off-season and was raring to go.
I'm feeling really good, she said.
It was really refreshing because after a pretty difficult year it was great to be able to play tennis for such a long period of time without feeling concerned or worried about getting injured.
The fifth seed could face former world number one Lindsay Davenport in the second round in what will be the American's first grand slam tournament in 16 months, after a year off in which she had her first child.
Sharapova said she would be in for a tough match if she faced the American, champion at Melbourne Park in 2000.
The bottom line is that she's a dedicated champion, she said.
She's really good at what she does.
Without a doubt, she is going to be playing on a good level again.
But we've got to take care of business in the first round first.
AC Milan beat Napoli 5-2 on Sunday to record their first league win at the San Siro this term with Pato scoring on his debut and Ronaldo netting twice to open his season's account.
Ronaldo, playing in only his second match this season after injury problems, gave Milan a 15th-minute lead when his shot ballooned off Napoli keeper Gennaro Iezzo and just crossed line before Andrea Cupi hooked clear.
Napoli equalised when Ezequiel Lavezzi's cross was toe-poked in by Roberto Sosa, but Milan were soon back in front when Iezzo denied Brazilian 18-year-old Pato twice only for Clarence Seedorf to smash home.
A clumsy foul by Kakha Kaladze on Lavezzi allowed Maurizio Domizzi to pull Napoli level from the penalty spot after 38 minutes of an enthralling first half.
The second period belonged to Milan however, with a diving header from Ronaldo, Kaka's crisp shot and Pato's cool finish sealing the win in style.
The European champions remain 12th but have three games in hand on most clubs having won the Club World Cup in Japan in December before Serie A's three-week midseason break.
Pato, part of a three-pronged Brazilian attack, joined Milan from Internacional in the close season but was ineligible until now.
He was nervous in the first half but gradually improved.
I am not the phenomenon, Ronaldo is, the much-heralded Pato told Sky.
I told him that after the goal.
Earlier unbeaten Inter Milan maintained their seven-point lead at the top of Serie A after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's double helped the champions to a 3-2 win at a battling Siena.
Ibrahimovic converted a debatable penalty on 26 minutes after Julio Cruz had collided with Paul Codrea.
Siena equalised quickly when Inter defender Ivan Cordoba appeared to get the last touch under pressure from Massimo Maccarone but the champions went back in front on the stroke of halftime when Esteban Cambiasso slid in Ibrahimovic's pass.
The Swede grabbed his 11th of the league campaign in the second half with a cracking shot and despite Fernando Forestieri's late goal, Inter hung on for their seventh straight Serie A win and 11th successive victory in all competitions.
AS Roma moved back up to second but had to come from behind to beat Atalanta 2-1 thanks to Francesco Totti's low freekick and Mancini's thumping strike.
Luciano Spalletti's side went above Juventus, who drew 1-1 at Catania on Saturday and are now three points behind in third, while Udinese stayed fourth after Fabio Quagliarella secured a 1-0 win at bottom side Cagliari.
Fiorentina are a point further back in fifth after Adrian Mutu's brace set up a 2-1 win at Parma, although his second from the penalty spot late on followed a dive from Christian Vieri.
Ivory Coast forward Amara Diane scored twice to fire Paris St Germain to a 3-0 win over Racing Lens on Sunday, the capital side's first home Ligue 1 win this season.
Stade Rennes recovered from a goal down to beat Olympique Marseille 3-1 courtesy of two late Sylvain Wiltord goals in the other game played on Sunday.
Former Portugal striker Pauleta opened the scoring for PSG from a backward pass by Diane on 58 minutes.
Diane did the rest himself, doubling the advantage with an angled shot in the 65th before wrapping it up with a header two minutes later.
PSG climb to 11th while Lens stay third from bottom.
Marseille took the lead in Rennes through forward Djibril Cisse but the home side equalised before the break thanks to former Marseille striker Mickael Pagis.
The visitors had Argentine newcomer Juan Angel Krupoviesa sent off for a dangerous tackle on Pagis in the 68th minute.
Rennes then took control with two goals in the last eight minutes from France forward Wiltord.
Rennes move up to ninth while Marseille slide down to 12th.
Champions Olympique Lyon went six points clear at the top after recovering from a goal down to beat Toulouse 3-2 on Saturday.
Lyon, chasing a seventh successive title, moved on to 42 points from 20 matches, six ahead of second-placed Nancy who had to be content with a 0-0 draw at Caen.
Ruud van Nistelrooy scored two late goals as Spanish champions Real Madrid defeated bottom side Levante 2-0 on Sunday to re-establish their seven-point lead over Barcelona at the top of the table.
A staggering 36 points separated Real and Levante before kick-off but on the pitch there was little to choose between them before Dutch striker van Nistelrooy stole the points with his 10th and 11th goals of the campaign.
The Dutch forward put Real ahead on 76 minutes from the penalty spot before adding a second two minutes from time with a clincal right-footed strike.
It was hard work but we got the win and it will be vital for us come the end of the season, said Real coach Bernd Schuster.
Real's next match is the derby against Atletico Madrid next Sunday and Schuster said his players would require no motivation for the capital clash.
Sometimes it is difficult to motivate your players to face a team that is theoretically inferior but next week I won't need to say a thing just like it was for the Barcelona match, added the German.
Atletico are riding high in third after a 1-0 home win over Valencia.
Kun Aguero took advantage of a mistake from Valencia goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand to score the decisive goal and Atletico move above Espanyol who saw their 14-match unbeaten run come to an abrupt end with a surprise 1-0 loss at Almeria.
Espanyol had not lost since a 2-1 defeat to Recreativo Huelva at the end of September but an 87th minute goal from Kalu Uche ended that sequence.
It was our worst away performance of the season, admitted Espanyol boss Ernesto Valverde.
Villarreal are now breathing down their necks after a 4-3 comeback win over strugglers Deportivo La Coruna.
Turkish international Nihat scored twice in as many minutes to help Villarreal close to within a point of Espanyol.
Villarreal looked to be heading for their seventh defeat of the campaign trailing 2-1 but Nihat struck twice, in the 66th and 68th minutes, to turn the game in their favour.
We were poor for 65 minutes and good for 25, confessed Villarreal coach Manuel Pellegrini.
Conceding so many goals makes it difficult to have a good campaign but reaching 35 points at this stage means there are more positives than negatives.
Fernando Gago started in the midfield for Real with Mohamadou Diarra gone for the African Nations Cup and Miguel Torres replaced the suspended Sergio Ramos at right back.
Goalkeeper Iker Casillas shrugged off a bout of gastro-enteritis to start with Schuster seemingly reluctant to field former Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek.
Levante started the better with Real squandering possession far too easily but the champions look so dangerous going forward and Julio Baptista and Raul both had efforts cleared off the goal-line.
In the second half Baptista and Brazilian compatriot Robinho both hit the post as Levante rode their luck.
Real had only failed to score in of the their previous 18 league matches and the breakthrough came on 76 minutes with Jose Serrano unfortunately handling in the penalty area.
Van Nistelrooy made no mistake with the penalty sending the goalkeeper the wrong way and he scored again on 88 minutes as Real took the spoils.
Spanish League side Real Zaragoza on Sunday sacked coach Victor Fernandez following the 2-2 draw with Real Mallorca.
Zaragoza confirmed the exit of Fernandez, who has seen his team, a creditable sixth last season, fall to 12th in the Spanish top division.
Local favourite Fernandez coached Zaragoza from 1990 to 1997 winning the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup in 1994 before returning to the club in June 2006 after a spell with Portuguese side FC Porto.
Germany international Tim Borowski will join Bayern Munich when his contract with Werder Bremen expires at the end of the season.
Werder said in a statement on Sunday that midfielder Borowski had rejected the offer of a new contract and would instead move to rivals Bayern, where he will be reunited with his former national team coach Juergen Klinsmann.
It's a shame, coach Thomas Schaaf said.
We would have happily carried on working with Tim.
Borowski, 27, was part of the Germany squad that Klinsmann led to third place at the World Cup on home soil in 2006.
Bayern announced on Friday that Klinsmann would return to the Bundesliga to take over as their coach as of July 1.
Defending champion Serena Williams and world number one Justine Henin safely negotiated the Australian Open first round Monday, as third seed Jelena Jankovic narrowly avoided a major upset.
Under blazing sun, a super-fit Williams sailed past Australian qualifier Jarmila Gajdosova 6-3, 6-3 in just over an hour, but was below her best as she began her quest for a ninth Grand Slam title.
I think everyone could probably tell I was a little scratchy.
Actually, I think she has a really, really good return.
Williams stunned the tennis world here last year when she beat Maria Sharapova in the final after entering the tournament unseeded and ranked 81 after an injury-plagued 2006.
She said the memories came flooding back when she walked out on centre court.
Yeah, I just thought about last year, my last match on that court, I was able to win it.
I didn't think about the ceremony, holding up the trophy.
I just got right back into the swing of things and thought, I have to stay focused.
Williams has highlighted top seed Henin, who won the Sydney International on Friday, and her sister Venus as her main threats.
The Belgian was given an unexpectedly tough workout by Japan's Aiko Nakamura in her match, before winning 6-2, 6-2.
It's been the best season of my career but I'm just focused on this tournament now, said Henin, who won here in 2004 but missed last year's tournament as she finalised her divorce.
What I did last year is in the past but it gave me a lot of joy and a lot of experience and I hope I can use it this year.
She is now unbeaten in 29 matches, a run stretching back to the Wimbledon semi-final last July.
Jankovic very nearly became a high-profile casualty when she was pushed to the limit by 17-year-old Austrian Tamira Paszek before prevailing 2-6, 6-2, 12-10 in an epic three hour, nine minute battle.
The highly-fancied Serb, who enjoyed a rapid rise through the women's rankings in 2007, gave away the first set 2-6 but got back into her stride by taking the second.
The 22-year-old's characteristic vigour came to the fore in a thrilling third set which lasted almost two hours.
Both players were feeling the pace with Jankovic receiving treatment for a lower back problem and Paszek, ranked 39, leaving the court for a left hip injury.
The matches were played on the new Plexicushion hardcourts that have replaced the Rebound Ace that had been used here since 1988.
The surface is designed to help reduce wear and tear injuries for the players, as well as produce more consistent bounce and cooler court temperatures.
But the most striking difference for the fans is that the surface has changed from green to blue.
Among the men, 24th seed Jarkko Nieminen made the second round with a five set victory over Canada's Frank Dancevic while 23rd seed Paul Henri-Mathieu beat Victor Hanescu of Romania.
Defending champion Roger Federer kickstarts his drive for a 13th Grand Slam crown on Tuesday, having recovered from a bug that threatened to derail his tournament.
His main challenge is expected to come from Rafael Nadal, who plays Serbia's Viktor Troicki in an evening match Monday.
Among his other rivals, Andy Roddick plays the Czech Republic's Lukas Dlouhy while world number three Novak Djokovic is up against Germany's Benjamin Becker on Tuesday.
Bayern Munich on Monday confirmed the arrival of Germany international Tim Borowski from Werder Bremen next season.
Bayern added the 27-year-old attacking midfielder was about to sign a three-year contract till 2011.
Borowski has played 157 matches for Werder Bremen, since signing in 2001, and scored 21 goals, also achieving the league and cup double in 2004.
Borowski, who injured his left knee at the beginning of the season and has only played nine matches in the Bundesliga since August, said: I view this transfer as a real challenge in sporting terms.
I am going to be 28 this year and it was really now or never to try something new.
He added the arrival of Jurgen Klinsmann as Munich coach next season could only be positive for him but emphasised this did not influence his decision to join the club.
The news can only add to tension between the clubs which finished the first half of the championship on the same number of points and occupying the first two places.
Borowski, who will join former Bremen team-mate Miroslav Klose who left Werder to join the Bavarian club last summer, will complete an impressive contingent of Germany internationals at the club, including Klose, Lukas Podolski, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Jan Schlaudraff and Marcell Jansen.
Former player Ander Garitano was appointed coach of Real Zaragoza on Monday following the dismissal of coach Victor Fernandez.
Garitano, who had been in charge of one of the club's youth sides, was confident he could turn the team around after their recent run of poor form.
I haven't the slightest doubt that I'm up to the job, I'm in good spirits and I'm confident that the team we've put together will be able to take this club forward, the 38-year-old told a news conference.
Garitano, who made his name as a midfielder at Athletic Bilbao, played for Zaragoza for six seasons between 1996 and 2002 before retiring and moving on to the coaching staff.
Club president Eduardo Bandres said Garitano was not an interim appointment.
Earlier, his predecessor Fernandez said he understood the club's decision to dismiss him given the team's failure to live up to expectations in the first half of the season.
They got rid of me because the results were a long way from meeting the ambitious objectives the club set for itself and that is a legitimate and respectable reason, the 47-year-old told a news conference.
I'm relaxed and calm but hurt by the fact I couldn't deliver what they wanted.
Zaragoza slipped to 12th in the table after a 2-2 home draw with Real Mallorca on Sunday, their ninth consecutive Primera Liga game without a win.
I felt I could turn things around as we were only halfway through the season, said Fernandez, who was coach when Zaragoza won the 1994 King's Cup and the 1995 European Cup Winners' Cup and returned to the club in 2006.
I won't be coming back as coach that's for sure.
I would only return as sporting director or president.
Argentina have named Sergio Batista, a midfielder in their victorious 1986 World Cup team, as coach of their Olympic side for this year's Games in Beijing.
It will be Sergio Batista, Argentina Football Association president Julio Grondona told Radio La Red in an interview.
We intend to send the strongest possible team but we have to see how things work out.
Batista is currently coach of Argentina's Under-20 team.
Grondona added that Alfio Basile, coach of the senior side, would be concentrating on the World Cup qualifiers.
Argentina won the gold medal at the Athens Olympics in 2004 when Marcelo Bielsa, who was also senior coach at the time, led the team to glory with a 1-0 final victory over Paraguay.
The Olympic tournament is restricted to Under-23 teams although each can field up to three over-age players.
Argentina playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme has already said that he would like to play in Beijing.
Former Newcastle United manager Kevin Keegan became the latest person linked to the vacant manager's job at St James' Park on Monday following the departure of Sam Allardyce last week.
Keegan, who played for the club in the 1980s and managed them for five years in the 1990s, taking them close to the title in 1996, told Sky Sports News on Monday he was not ruling himself in or out, quickly adding: It's a club I love, everyone knows that.
Former England boss Keegan has not coached since leaving Manchester City in March 2005, but fevered speculation in the North East has linked him alongside Alan Shearer as a possible management duo now Portsmouth's Harry Redknapp has declined the position.
The search for Allardyce's replacement is gathering pace with Blackburn Rovers manager Mark Hughes the favourite to take control of the club who crashed to a 6-0 defeat at Manchester United on Saturday.
Hughes refused to rule himself out either after Blackburn beat Bolton Wanderers 2-1 on Sunday, twice passing up an opportunity to say he would still be at Ewood Park in the summer.
It's a hypothetical question and I don't answer hypothetical questions.
In football you never say never but I'm very happy to be Blackburn Rovers manager.
Graeme Souness, who managed the club between 2004 and 2006 said he would be willing to return now that the club had a new chairman.
Souness, who worked under Freddy Shepherd, said: With a new chairman there now, I'd certainly be interested in returning.
Souness added if he was offered the job, he would take it in a heartbeat.
It is a big club, It has got the potential to be one of the best.
But its not a quick fix and whoever gets it is going to need a minimum of three or four years.
Other names for the job include Gerard Houllier, the former Liverpool coach, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, ex-Tottenham Hotspur manager Martin Jol and former England and Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren.
The world's leading tennis players were forced to keep cool heads as Australia's skin-reddening sun burnt down on Melbourne Park on Tuesday and day two of the Australian Open got underway.
A gentle breeze kept temperatures manageable but men's third seed Novak Djokovic turned up some heat of his own to oust Benjamin Becker 6-0 6-2 7-6.
I started really well, the 20-year-old said.
Honestly saying, I was nervous before the match, knowing that I'm a big favourite in the first round.
Women's second seed Svetlana Kuznetsova swept past France's Nathalie Dechy 6-3 6-1 in just over an hour.
I just try to do my best every single match, she told the crowd.
Everyone who plays a grand slam is a great player so.
Sixth seed Anna Chakvetadze was spared the sapping sun when Germany's Andrea Petkovic retired with a knee injury in the first game of their match.
Top seed and world number one Roger Federer opens his campaign for a third consecutive Australian Open title and fourth overall later on Tuesday under lights against Argentine Diego Hartfield.
The 2002 champion Thomas Johansson is up against Marcos Baghdatis and 2005 winner Marat Safin takes on Latvia's Ernests Gulbis.
Djokovic oozed confidence in his opener, racing through the first seven games of the match and clinching the opening set in 22 minutes.
Becker, whose claim to fame is that he ended Andre Agassi's career by beating him at the 2006 U.S. Open, had no answers in the second set either and, despite a rally in the third, offered little resistance to the Serb.
Djokovic, seeking his first grand slam title, plays Italian Simone Bolelli in the second round.
It's natural that you feel the pressure, Djokovic said of the added expectation this year as third seed.
If you don't feel pressure something is wrong with you, but it's a matter of how you deal with the pressure.
I'm trying not to think about that too much, about the expectations, about the people saying, 'you got enough quality to win a grand slam this year, especially in Australia or U.S. Open, because of the hard courts'.
It's very flattering but, you know, it kind of puts a lot of pressure on me.
I'm only 20 years old, so hopefully, you know, I'm going to have another 10 or 15 years of professional tennis.
Women's ninth seed Daniela Hantuchova survived a decent work out before downing American Vania King 6-3 7-5, though she too refused to speculate on her chances.
I was just really pleased to get through in two sets, it was tough out there, the Slovak smiled It was very tight.
Injury-hit Italian giants Juventus want to sign Aston Villa's veteran Swedish international defender Olof Mellberg, the English Premier League club said on Friday.
It could mean the 30-year-old will play his last game for Villa in Saturday's home clash with Blackburn.
Juventus are believed to have made an offer of 500,000 pounds and Villa coach Martin O'Neill is expected to reveal whether a deal has gone through on Monday.
San Antonio Spurs guard Brent Barry will miss up to a month of the National Basketball Association season with a calf injury, the defending league champions announced Friday.
The 37-year-old guard will miss the next three to four weeks after being injured in the third quarter of San Antonio's 90-89 victory Thursday over Miami.
An MRI exam Friday showed he suffered a muscle strain in the same area as a torn muscle that kept him sidelined for nine games after being hurt December 26 in a 94-79 victory over Chicago.
Barry has averaged 7.3 points and 1.9 rebounds a game this season for the Spurs, who at 28-13 are among a handful of clubs fighting for the top record in the Western Conference.
Turkish middle-distance runner Sureyya Ayhan received a life ban from the Turkish Athletic Federation Friday for a second doping violation.
The former European 1,500-metre champion tested positive for an unnamed banned substance last September while training in the United States ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Ayhan's coach and husband, Yucel Kop, was given a two-year ban.
Both have said they will appeal the decision.
Ayhan's first doping ban came in 2005, when she was barred from competing for two years.
As well as her 2002 European title, Ayhan also won silver at the 2003 World Championships in Paris.
Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A.
Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has been ruled out of Sunday's trip to Livorno with a bad back.

Bayern Munich extended their lead over Werder Bremen at the top of the Bundesliga to four points Sunday as Ze Roberto ensured a 1-1 draw at home to fourth-placed SV Hamburg.
Hamburg went into the match against Bayern sitting in fourth spot and knowing defeat would see them nine points adrift and out of the title race.
Instead a 1-1 draw means they return north joint third in table with Bayer Leverkusen and just two points adrift of Bremen.
The 69,000 fans at a sold-out Allianz Arena in Munich saw a first half bereft of clear-cut chances with Bayern going close only once, when on 23 minutes Luca Toni almost got on the end of a pass from Miroslav Klose.
However, the second half was a much more open affair with the first half-chance falling Hamburg's way in the 54th minute as Ze Roberto cut out a dangerous cross from Ivica Olic.
Within a minute, Ze Roberto could have put the home side in front but instead it was Olic who opened the scoring on the hour mark when a dreadful error from Lucio saw the Brazilian defender lose possession to David Jarolim, who promptly set up the Croatian to slam the ball home from 11 metres.
But six minutes later Bayern were level as substitute Franck Ribery pulled the ball back for Ze Roberto to make it 1-1 and salvage a point for Bayern.
The game finished on a sour note for Bayern as Mark van Bommel was sent off in added time when he received two yellow cards in quick succession, the second for gesturing his disgust at being booked in the first place.

He piled up a remarkable 14 birdies in 29 holes to register his third triumph in 10 editions of the elite World Golf Championships events and his sixth successive tournament win worldwide.
Woods, who had previously won the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at La Costa in 2003 and 2004, shattered the record for the largest winning margin in the final.
American David Toms beat compatriot Chris DiMarco 6&5 to claim the 2005 title, also at La Costa.
Match play is very fickle and whatever your opponent does, you have to react, a smiling Woods said in a greenside interview after being presented with the coveted Walter Hagen Cup.
This week I made a bunch of birdies to advance.
I had a great feel for the greens and, once I got the pace, they the putts kept falling.
Already arguably the greatest player in history, Woods has now clinched 15 WGC crowns in 26 starts since the series began in 1999.

Only Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus and Ben Hogan have won more I can't wait to see Arnie, said Woods, again flashing his trademark smile.
A Samuel Eto'o hat-trick helped Barcelona put the pressure on leaders Real Madrid in a 5-1 home win over bottom club Levante in the Primera Liga on Sunday.
Frank Rijkaard's side closed to within two points of Real, who were playing Getafe at the Bernabeu in the late game, with Cameroon's Eto'o and Argentina's Lionel Messi, who scored one and set up two, in irresistible form.
Levante had caused murmurs of unrest at the Nou Camp when they cancelled out Xavi's opener from the penalty spot just before the break, but they offered little as Barca upped the tempo in the second half.
Earlier, Villarreal came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 away to strengthen their hold on third place with 46 points, eight behind Barca.

Espanyol slipped to their sixth defeat in seven games when they went down 2-0 at Deportivo Coruna and are level on 39 points with Sevilla in sixth.
Barca looked to have gained the perfect start at the Nou Camp when Spain midfielder Xavi arrived late in the box to bury a loose ball in the back of the net after 14 minutes.
However, the expected flood of goals did not come straight away and it was the visitors who grew in confidence.
Midfielder Juanma's shot was pushed onto a post by Victor Valdes, and in the 41st minute Italy full back Gianluca Zambrotta's handball in the area earned Levante a penalty, which Riga duly converted.
Messi picked up Xavi's backheel and fired in from the edge of the area to restore Barca's lead a minute before halftime and he turned provider for Eto'o just after the restart, with a defence-splitting pass.
Messi squared for Eto'o to make it 4-1 after a great pass from Yaya Toure in the 62nd and substitute Bojan Krkic crossed for Eto'o to complete his hat-trick three minutes from time.

Inter boss Roberto Mancini, reeling from Tuesday's 2-0 Champions League defeat at Liverpool, travelled to former club Sampdoria without main strikers Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Julio Cruz because of injury.
Argentine striker Crespo showed their strength in depth, though, when he nodded in Dejan Stankovic's cross on 76 minutes after the in-form Cassano had expertly smashed home.
We went into this game after the Champions League match and we were a bit tired.
We suffered and battled after going behind, and a draw is a fair result, Mancini told Sky.
Roma, now four points above Juventus on 51, were fortunate to take the three points after Cicinho scuffed home with Francesco Totti standing in an offside position in front of Fiorentina keeper Sebastien Frey.
Fiorentina also lost top striker Adrian Mutu to injury in the first half and hit the bar through Zdravko Kuzmanovic.
Cicinho was dismissed in stoppage time for two quick bookings and will miss Wednesday's big game at Inter.
The San Siro game will determine everything.
It will be a fundamental match, Roma coach Luciano Spalletti told reporters.
Juve take on Torino in the Turin derby on Tuesday. 
American Astana rider Levi Leipheimer won the Tour of California cycle race for the second straight year here on Sunday.
American George Hincapie won the final stage of the eight-day race, 150km from Santa Clarita that finished with a rain-swept circuit race around the Rose Bowl Stadium.
Leipheimer, who rode for Discovery Channel when he won in 2007, finished in the main pack along with his nearest rivals to secure the crown.
Leipheimer, who seized the overall lead after Wednesday's third stage, had taken a 49-second lead over Briton David Millar into the final stage.
Everton leapfrogged Liverpool back into fourth place in the Premier League on Monday with an impressive 2-0 victory at Manchester City.
Goals in the first half from Ayegbeni Yakubu and Joleon Lescott were enough for Everton who moved three points above Liverpool in the race for the fourth Champions League.
Everton have 50 points from 27 games while Liverpool, who have played a game less, are on 47 along with Aston Villa.
City, who also still harbour ambitions of fourth place, had only lost once at home in the league this season and memorably won 2-1 at Manchester United in their last outing, but they were well beaten by Everton.
The visitors had already had a strong penalty shout declined and struck the woodwork before Nigerian Yakubu converted a Tim Cahill cross from close range after half an hour.
England central defender Lescott made it 2-0 seven minutes later with a well-directed header from a Lee Carsley free kick, his sixth league goal of the season.
Everton dominated after the break and would have won by more had it not been for a string of fine saves by City goalkeeper Joe Hart.
City's miserable night was complete when Martin Petrov was shown a red card in the last minute for a foul on Leon Osman.
AC Milan playmaker Kaka hopes to be fit to face Arsenal next week after the reoccurrence of a knee problem in Sunday's 2-1 win over Palermo.
The Brazilian came off at halftime as a precaution and was expected to miss Wednesday's match at Catania and next Saturday's clash with Lazio in order to be ready for the Champions League last 16 second leg at San Siro next Tuesday.
However, Kaka is more injured than first thought and could be a doubt for the crucial match, with the scores level at 0-0.
It hurts a lot, the world player of the year told TeleLombardia on Monday.
I hope to be fit for the Champions league match with Arsenal.
I definitely won't be there against Catania.
Kaka was reluctant to wade into the big debate in Italy over recent controversial refereeing decisions but did have one message for the officials.
Something must be done because at the moment I'm taking lots of whacks, not just me but also the other forwards, he said.
Former IBF and WBC light welterweight champion Ricky Hatton will return to the ring on May 24 with a possible fight against American Juan Lazcano, the English fighter said on Monday.
Hatton, still the IBO title holder at light welterweight, was knocked out by American Floyd Mayweather Jnr in Las Vegas in December when he moved up a weight to challenge for the WBC welterweight title.
The Manchester-based fighter, beaten just once in his 44 professional career bouts, said he will move back down to light welterweight with the fight taking place in Manchester or London.
It would be nice to repay the fans as a way to say thank you to them for coming over to the States, Hatton told the BBC.
Vegas is like my second home and I will go back there.
The 32-year-old Lazcano has not fought since losing to Vivian Harris in an eliminator for the WBC light-welterweight title in Vegas a year ago.
He's a good fighter, we should have fought him before but he got injured, Hatton said.
David Beckham and the Los Angeles Galaxy will play an exhibition match March 9 against Hong Kong Union at Hong Kong Stadium, the Major League Soccer club announced Monday.
The match will be the third game of the Galaxy's exhibition tour of Asia which begins next week.
The Hong Kong game will mark the final game of the tour designed to tap into Beckham's huge popularity in Asia.
The game will follow matchups against FC Seoul in Seoul, South Korea on March 1 and Shanghai-Hong Kong United in Shanghai, China on March 5.
We are very excited to be able to add this important third match to the Galaxy's Asia Tour 2008, said Galaxy assistant GM Tom Payne said.
Last week, the Galaxy finished third in the inaugural Pan Pacific Championship tournament in Hawaii, losing their opening game 1-0 to Japanese club Gamba Osaka before beating Australia's Sydney FC 2-1 in the third-place game.
The Galaxy were due to leave Hawaii for Seoul on Monday.
Arsenal's Eduardo da Silva has forgiven Birmingham City defender Martin Taylor for the tackle that left him with a fractured left fibula and dislocated ankle.
The Brazilian-born Croatia international faces up to nine months on the sidelines after undergoing surgery on Saturday.
He suffered the injury during the weekend's Premier League match that ended in a 2-2 draw.
I forgive Martin.
It hurt like hell but I'm fine now.
I know he did not do it on purpose, Eduardo was quoted as saying in Tuesday's Sun newspaper.
I was horrified when I saw how my leg looked at first and wondered how it would all end.
But I will be back.
The striker, who turned 25 on Monday, refused to get too disheartened.
These things can happen in football.
I see this as a risk
of professional football, he told the Daily Mail.
Sometimes you go up, sometimes you go down.
Arsenal said he would be released from hospital in a few days.
Australian goalkeeper Danny Vukovic on Tuesday was considering an appeal against a 15-month ban for striking referee Mark Shield in Sunday's A-League final between his Central Coast Mariners and the Newcastle Jets.
Vukovic was given the ban - six months of it suspended on a probationary basis - after his side lost 1-0 in the Sydney final.
Vukovic struck Shield in a melee just minutes from full-time, when it was claimed the referee had missed a blatant penalty-box handball by a Newcastle player.
Had the penalty been converted, the match would have gone into extra time.
Vukovic will not be eligible to play in next season's A-League competition until November 24.
He also loses his chance to keep for Australia at this year's Beijing Olympics.
Dutchman Pim Verbeek, the Australia coach, said he was disappointed by Vukovic.
I think that's one of the things players have to learn, Verbeek said It's stupid, there's no doubt about that.
We can be honest about that.
He should have never done that.
Hopefully he will learn from it, and hopefully every player can learn from it, because you can not accept things like that as a professional football player.
Liverpool piled more misery on Newcastle United with a 3-0 victory at Anfield in the Premier League on Saturday.
First-half goals from Jermaine Pennant and Fernando Torres, his 25th of the season, and Steven Gerrard's effort after the break strengthened Liverpool's hold on fourth place.
Relegation-threatened Newcastle, without a league win since December, have picked up only two points in seven matches since Kevin Keegan returned as manager in January and are leaking goals at an alarming rate.
It was disappointing, Keegan told Sky Sports television.
The first goal was a killer but other than that I didn't think we showed enough courage or self belief on the ball.
They were much better than us.
Reading, third from bottom at the start, jumped five places with a 2-0 home victory over Manchester City while second-from-bottom Fulham drew 1-1 at Blackburn Rovers.
League leaders Arsenal have the chance to forge four points clear of second-placed Manchester United when they travel to Wigan Athletic on Sunday.
Everton visit Sunderland the same day and Tottenham Hotspur host West Ham United.
Liverpool, who have suddenly hit form despite the off-field battle for control of the club, had the points in the bag thanks to two goals before halftime.
Pennant enjoyed a huge slice of fortune when Jose Enrique's 43rd-minute clearance hit him and looped into the net but there was no luck in Torres's strike two minutes later when he slotted past keeper Steve Harper after being played in by Gerrard.
Liverpool, who travel to Inter Milan next week protecting a 2-0 advantage in the Champions League.
Were able to coast after Torres turned provider for captain Gerrard six minutes into the second half.
Rafa Benitez's side now have 56 points from 29 games, three more than Everton in fifth and two fewer than third-placed Chelsea who have two games in hand.
Newcastle, who have conceded 13 goals in their last four league games, are only three points above the relegation zone with most of the teams below them having played fewer matches.
Reading, who snapped a long losing sequence last week at Middlesbrough, had second-half goals from Shane Long and Dave Kitson to thank for the win over City that make their survival chances rosier.
City have not scored in their last three league matches.
Fulham look to be heading down despite their battling draw at Blackburn.
Morten Gamst Pedersen put Rovers in front before Jimmy Bullard's late equaliser.
The London club are six points from safety.
Serie A leaders Inter Milan went nine points clear on Saturday after celebrating their centenary with a regulation 2-0 win over second-from-bottom Reggina.
AS Roma can cut the gap back to six points on Sunday if they win at Napoli, where champions Inter suffered their first defeat of the league season last weekend, going down 1-0.
Inter striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, returning after two weeks out with a knee problem, opened the scoring with a penalty and proved his fitness ahead of Tuesday's Champions League last 16 second leg at home to Liverpool, who lead 2-0.
The Swede, who also hit the bar with a free kick, netted his 15th of the campaign on 14 minutes after Esteban Cambiasso was sandwiched by Carlos Adrian Valdez and Luca Tognozzi.
However, the first contact was just outside the area in the latest of a series of fortunate decisions for Inter this season.
Defender Nicolas Burdisso made it 2-0 on 34 minutes with a bullet header from Luis Jimenez's deep free kick.
Reggina had chances but keeper Julio Cesar, who made a rare blunder for Napoli's goal last Sunday, was back to his best.
It was important to react after a period that's not been all that positive, coach Roberto Mancini told reporters before turning his thoughts to Liverpool.
It will have to be a special night.
Inter were formed on March 9, 1908 when a group broke away from Milan Cricket and Football Club, later to become AC Milan, because they wanted to open up a team to foreigners.
Inter have never been relegated from the top flight since.
Events have been going on all week to celebrate the centenary but the game did not go entirely to plan with Hernan Crespo hurting his head and joining a lengthy injury list.
Marco Materazzi partnered usual right back Burdisso in central defence with Walter Samuel and Ivan Cordoba out for the season, but Materazzi is suspended for Tuesday so Inter are hoping Cristian Chivu can shrug off a shoulder problem to play.
Captain Javier Zanetti, predominantly a right midfielder nowadays, started at left back with Maxwell injured.
During the party after the game, the San Siro's giant screens showed video messages from former Inter players while a wedding for two fans was also held
Club president Massimo Moratti, who upset Milan and Juventus during the week with comments about Inter's superiority, also attempted to sing but hastily gave up.
In Saturday's other match, Palermo in eighth drew 1-1 with sixth-placed Udinese after Fabio Simplicio's 20-metre volley for the Sicilians was cancelled out by Felipe's second-half goal.
Olympique Lyon moved closer to a seventh consecutive Ligue 1 title by beating Girondins Bordeaux 4-2 with two Mathieu Bodmer goals in a pulsating top-of-the-table clash on Sunday.
Lyon gained a measure of consolation for their Champions League elimination by Manchester United, moving six points clear of second-placed Bordeaux.
Midfielder Bodmer showed the home side the way by tapping home a Fabio Grosso cross on 12 minutes before doubling the advantage with a classic effort 12 minutes later.
Bodmer controlled the ball with his chest once to flick the ball over Bordeaux midfielder Alou Diarra, then twice before firing into the top right corner with a magnificent volley.
Visitors Bordeaux kept fighting and reduced the arrears before the break with a free kick from 25 metres by Brazilian midfielder Wendel.
Lyon were soon back in control, however, France striker Karim Benzema scoring with an angled shot from the edge of the box for his 17th league goal this season five minutes into the second half.
Argentine striker Fernando Cavenaghi kept the match alive with a penalty for Bordeaux 10 minutes later but Lyon held tight before completing the scoring in added time through Ivory Coast forward Kader Keita.
It was a very good match, very intense with a lot of emotions, Lyon coach Alain Perrin said after a spectacular but tense contest featuring eight yellow cards.
Credit to Bordeaux, who never gave up and made us fight very hard for this, Perrin told French television channel Canal Plus.
Olympique Marseille extended their home winning streak to eight games with a 2-0 win over St Etienne earlier on Sunday.
Second-half goals by midfielder Mathieu Valbuena and Nigeria defender Taye Taiwo kept fourth-placed Marseille in the hunt for a Champions League berth, three points behind third-placed Nancy, who defeated Monaco 2-0 on Saturday.
The FA Cup will boast one Premier League side in the last four after Cardiff City continued a weekend of shocks by beating Middlesbrough 2-0 on Sunday.
First-half goals from Peter Whittingham and Roger Johnson handed the Championship second division side a deserved win at the Riverside and a place in the semi-finals alongside
Portsmouth, Barnsley and five-times winners West Bromwich Albion, who last lifted the trophy in 1968.
The last time there was only one top-flight team in the FA Cup semi-finals was 1908.
West Brom restored some order to the competition after the Championship promotion challengers ended the run of League One third division outfit Bristol Rovers with a 5-1 victory, Ishmael Miller hitting a hat-trick.
On Saturday, Barnsley stunned holders Chelsea with a 1-0 win at Oakwell while Portsmouth ousted Premier League champions and last season's beaten finalists Manchester United with a 1-0 success at Old Trafford on Saturday.
Portsmouth are now favourites to win a second FA Cup, 69 years after their first triumph.
Cardiff are the only non-English FA Cup winners after lifting the trophy in 1927 and manager Dave Jones said he hoped his modern-day side could achieve their own slice of history.
Its important for us as a football club.
I get it rammed down my throat 1927 every time so we're trying to make our own history, and these boys deserve it and I'm sure the plane will be rocking, not with the wind but with us on it tonight, Jones told BBC Sport.
Cardiff rocked Middlesbrough by taking a ninth-minute lead - Whittingham producing some trickery inside the penalty box before unleashing a curling shot into the top right hand corner past a flailing Mark Schwarzer.
Boro claimed that a Cardiff player had handled in the build-up to the goal but their protests were waved away.
Whittingham then turned provider as the Welsh side doubled their lead on 22 minutes.
His freekick from the left was missed by all of Boro's static defenders who failed to pick up Johnson's run and the defender scored with a well-placed diving header.
James Morrison fired West Brom ahead after 16 minutes against Bristol Rovers, slotting in after keeper Steve Phillips had parried a shot into his path.
Miller hammered in a second on the half-hour before Rovers got one back immediately through Danny Coles following a corner.
Miller poked in to make it 3-1, substitute Kevin Phillips got a fourth and Miller completed his hat-trick in a one-sided second half.
The draw for the semi-finals is on Monday. 
Since the Football League began in 1888-89 there has never been a final between two clubs from outside the top division.
Hamburg SV missed a chance to go second in the Bundesliga when they drew 0-0 at Nuremberg on Sunday, while Bayer Leverkusen boosted their Champions League hopes with a 2-0 win over Hanover 96.
Hamburg played poorly against relegation candidates Nuremberg and only came away with a point thanks to a penalty save from Frank Rost at the end of the first half.
The result completed a great weekend for leaders Bayern Munich, who are seven points clear after their 2-0 win at home to Karlsruhe on Saturday.
Bayern have 50 points from 23 games, followed by Werder Bremen on 43, who suffered a humiliating 6-3 defeat at VfB Stuttgart on Saturday.
Hamburg stay third on 42, followed closely by Leverkusen on 41 after goals from Theofanis Gekas and Tranquillo Barnetta saw them to a comfortable win at home to Hanover.
Nuremberg are third from bottom.
While Bayern are now clear favourites for the title, the race for European places is too close to call.
The top two in Germany qualify directly for the Champions League, with the third-placed team going through to the final qualifying round.
Midfielder Xabi Alonso will miss Liverpool's Champions League match at Inter Milan on Tuesday because his girlfriend is having a baby, coach Rafael Benitez said on Monday.
Liverpool, 2-0 up from the first leg, will also be without right back Steve Finnan through injury but Javier Mascherano is fit to play after recovering from a dead leg.
Alonso's girlfriend is having a baby so he will not be here, the Spanish coach told a news conference ahead of the last 16, second leg.
He wanted to come if everything was okay but we couldn't wait so in the end we had to decide.
I cannot wait, wait, wait I need to use my squad.
Mascherano is ok, he is fit and will be here.
During the news conference, Benitez was informed of reports that Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks had terminated talks with DIC over a stake in the club.
Benitez said his side would not be distracted.
My reaction is trying to score a goal and win the game, he said.
We know we can not defend for a long time against a very good team.
We need to attack.
I have a lot of confidence that we will go forward.
Last season's runners-up have won five in a row coming into the match with striker Fernando Torres and captain Steven Gerrard in top form.
Jamie Carragher, who may play right back in the absence of Finnan, is also set to become the first Liverpool player to appear in 100 European games on Tuesday.
We know that Torres is on fire, the understanding with Gerrard is good, Benitez added.
Carragher is a player with a good mentality, he is a key player for us now and in the future.
A Brazilian referee was given a 15-day suspension on Monday for failing to send off a player despite showing him two yellow cards.
The incident occurred in the Paulista championship on Sunday when referee Jose Henrique de Carvalho twice booked Guaratingueta midfielder Magal in the first half of the 2-0 defeat by Corinthians.
He made some serious mistakes, Marcos Maurinho, head of the Paulista federation's refereeing committee, told Jovem Pan radio.
There was a procedural error when he wrote down he had given a card for the number five instead of number eight.
He maintained the decision even after being told by the fourth official.
Carvalho, who sent off Corinthians player Bovio in the first half, acknowledged the mistake in a television interview after the game and apologised to supporters.
A similar incident occurred at the 2006 World Cup when England's Graham Poll failed to send off Croatia's Josip Simunic after handing him a second yellow card against Australia.
Simunic was finally dismissed after the final whistle when he was given a third yellow card for dissent.
Karim Benzema's last-gasp goal earned Olympique Lyon a French Cup quarter-final place after a 2-1 home win over holders Sochaux on Tuesday.
The France striker, who also opened the scoring 10 minutes into the second half, struck the winner a minute into added time when he poked home Kader Keita's cross from the right.
Benzema's goal came just two minutes after Kandia Traore had got Sochaux back in the match with an equaliser.
Earlier on Tuesday, two goals by Loris Arnaud gave Paris St Germain a 2-1 win over Ligue 2 Bastia in their last 16 match.
Lyon, who have not lifted the trophy since beating Nantes 2-1 in the 1973 final, have won all four meetings with Sochaux this season after prevailing twice in Ligue 1 and once in the season opening Trophy of Champions.
Lyon went ahead when Benzema collected a defence-splitting Cris pass before beating goalkeeper Teddy Richert from close range but a handling error by Lyon keeper Gregory Coupet from Traore's effort gifted Sochaux an 89th-minute equaliser.
However, a lapse in concentration by Sochaux's defence allowed Lyon to score a deserved second goal as extra time loomed.
At Parc de Princes, PSG's 20-year-old striker Arnaud was the brightest player in a mostly inexperienced team against Bastia.
He opened the scoring after 18 minutes only for Pierre-Yves Andre to equalise for the Corsicans with a stunning 25-metre volley five minutes later.
However, Arnaud netted the winner when he latched onto a Sylvain Armand cross from the left in the 67th minute.
The victory was a morale boost for PSG, who are only just above the relegation zone in 17th spot in Ligue 1, ahead of a tricky league fixture at leaders Lyon on Sunday.
Ligue 2 Dijon reached the quarter-finals with a 3-1 win over third division Tours while Sedan beat Angers 2-0 in an all Ligue 2 clash.
Wednesday's last 16 matches feature second-placed Ligue 1 side Girondins Bordeaux against improving Lille while bottom team Metz visit Lorient.
Ten-times winners Olympique Marseille travel to amateurs Carquefou, who play in the fifth division.
The quarter-final ties will be played on April 15 and 16.
Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund beat 10-man Carl Zeiss Jena of the second division 3-0 in a German Cup semi-final on Tuesday.
The 1989 Cup winners will play the winner of Wednesday's semi-final between Bayern Munich and VfL Wolfsburg in the April 19 final in Berlin's Olympic stadium.
Brazil midfielder Tinga headed in a rebound in the 13th minute for Dortmund, who will be making their fourth trip to the Cup final, after Jena's Belarus goalkeeper Vasili Khomutovski batted away a Mladen Petric shot.
Jena who had reached the semi-finals by knocking out Bundesliga sides VfB Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Arminia Bielefeld put up a brave fight in the rain at Dortmund before a Cup record crowd of 80,708.
But Jena, struggling at the bottom of the second division table, were reduced to 10 men when Czech playmaker Jan Simak was sent of with two yellow cards for complaining about a foul in the 51st minute.
Dortmund coach Thomas Doll's decision to introduce Diego Klimowicz and Florian Kringe in the 69th minute proved inspired.
Two minutes later Klimowicz tapped in a rebound off a Kringe shot before Petric got the third goal three minutes from time.
We're all happy now, Doll, whose team are in 13th place in the Bundesliga, told reporters.
We've haven't exactly spoiled the crowd here for a while.
We didn't play very good.
It's been a rocky road for us.
Jena coach Henning Buerger said Simak's ejection was the turning point.
He's angry at himself right now, Buerger said.
But it's behind us now.
It's too bad we went out like this.
Three-times champion Roger Federer barely raised a sweat in brushing aside Frenchman Nicolas Mahut 6-1 6-1 in the Pacific Life Open third round on Tuesday.
The Swiss world number one and top seed, back in action at Indian Wells after recovering from a viral problem, outclassed his opponent in a match lasting 53 minutes on the Stadium Court.
I enjoy matches like this, Federer told reporters after setting up a fourth-round clash with Croat Ivan Ljubicic who upset 15th-seeded Tommy Robredo 6-3 6-4.
Having the sensation like I had today towards the end of the second set when you feel everything's going your way, you've got his game perfectly figured out and everything you're trying to do sort of works as well, it's just a good feeling.
I was really happy to break that often and I had no problems whatsoever on my own serve, added the 26-year-old after unleashing nine aces and winning 23 out of 24 points on his first serve.
It was a perfect match really for me.
Federer, who had competed in only two tournaments this season after succumbing to glandular fever, broke Mahut twice to sweep through the opening set.
The Swiss again broke the Frenchman in the third, fifth and seventh games of the second to ease into the fourth round.
A protracted rally in the fifth game underlined the near-impossible task facing Mahut when Federer, at full stretch on his forehand, delivered a pinpoint topspin lob to win the point.
Champion at Indian Wells for three years in a row from 2004, Federer suffered a surprise loss in the second round last year to Argentina's Guillermo Canas.
In his abbreviated campaign this year, he lost to Serb Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open semi-finals before being beaten in the first round in Dubai by Briton Andy Murray.
Federer, however, has cruised through his first two matches this week for the loss of just seven games.
I am overall excited being back, happy to be playing well, he said.
I couldn't really practise the way I wanted to before the Australian Open.
This time it's very different and I'm really looking forward to the rest.
Earlier on Tuesday, seventh-seeded David Nalbandian of Argentina scraped past Czech Radek Stepanek 7-6 0-6 7-6 in a third-round match lasting two-and-a-quarter hours.
Later in the day, fourth-seeded Russian Nikolay Davydenko faces American Mardy Fish and Murray, the 11th seed, meets Croat Ivo Karlovic.
Swiss Fabian Cancellara celebrated his 27th birthday with victory in the Tirreno-Adriatico on Tuesday.
The CSC rider finished 28th on the seventh and last stage won by Italy's Francesco Chicchi but ended the week-long race 16 seconds ahead of Italian Enrico Gasparotto.
Swede Thomas Lovkvist was third at 40 seconds.
The final 176-km stage around the holiday resort of San Benedetto del Tronto was affected by rain and Cancellara stayed out of trouble by riding in the front group.
The victory was his 41st in eight years as a professional.
He also won the Paris-Roubaix in 2006 and the world time trial title in 2006 and 2007.
I'm going to celebrate this victory and my 27th birthday with my team mates because they did a lot of work for me during the race, Cancellara told reporters.
Before the start I didn't consider myself a contender but I was able to win because of the hard work and training I've done in the last few months.
I won the time trial stage on Sunday and then hung on to the lead on the climbs.
Cancellara's victory will make him one of the favourites for Saturday's Milan-San Remo race but he refused to discuss his tactics for the first prestigious 'classic' of the season.
We've got on idea of our tactics at CSC but we're not going to tell anyone, he said.
We've got a strong team and Frank Schleck could also win so we've got several cards we could play.
Everybody will be watching me but I don't feel under pressure.
I'm going to stay in Milan in the next few days and stay focused on the race.
The Andean community joined the fight on Tuesday to reverse FIFA's ban on playing international matches at high altitude.
FIFA said last week that internationals can only be played above 2,750 metres if visiting teams are given one week to acclimatise and two weeks for matches above 3,000 metres, effectively ruling out games at these heights.
The stadium in Bolivia's capital, La Paz, is perched some 3,600 metres above sea level.
Ehlers expressed his support for Bolivia's call, made to all of South America, to not recognise FIFA's ruling and said he thinks the ban is heavy-handed, said a spokesman for Freddy Ehlers, secretary general of the Andean Community, a trade bloc that counts Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia as members.
On Monday, Bolivian President Evo Morales played a match in La Paz with Diego Maradona, captain of Argentina's 1986 World Cup-winning team, to show it was possible to run and breathe at high altitude.
Maradona described the ban as disgraceful.
Various other cities in Bolivia, and throughout Latin America, are affected by the FIFA ruling that was first introduced in May.
Following protests, the ban was dropped but reintroduced in December and upheld at a meeting in Zurich on Friday.
Saoul Mamby trains himself at John's Gym, a South Bronx oasis suspended in time a perfect fit for a former world champion who is fighting on at the age of 60.
It is not just to stay in shape that Mamby is skipping, working the speed bag, sparring and pounding a heavy bag hung from the rafters of the musky, converted postal station.
He wants a shot at winning another title.
I fought the best in the world.
At one time I was the best in the world, the grandfather of 11 told Reuters at the gym, where old timers visit and schoolchildren take their first steps towards learning the craft of boxing alongside professional wannabes.
If I can reach that level again, there's no harm in trying.
I don't want to sit back and be one of those shoulda, coulda, woulda people.
Earlier this month, Mamby, who was first crowned WBC light welterweight champion 28 years ago, became what is believed to be the oldest boxer ever in a sanctioned bout when he lost a 10-round decision in the Cayman Islands.
Mamby, lean and articulate with no grey showing in his braided brown locks, said he was rusty against 32-year-old Jamaican Anthony Osbourne, whose dismal record rose to 7-25-1.
I need fights like that to bring myself to where I was, said Mamby, whose record dropped to 45-34-6.
I hadn't fought in eight years, fighting a fighter who has been active.
I was in good shape but my tools were rusty.
The native New Yorker, a superb defensive boxer who failed to go the distance only once in his remarkable career when he was stopped at the age of 46 by American Derrell Coley, is not impressed by the current crop of fighters.
With all the titles out there today, it's not like when I was champ before.
I was WBC, Aaron Pryor was WBA, said Mamby, who made five successful defences in two-and-a-half years as champion.
Now they have multiple alphabet soups so my theory is one of them belongs to me.
He said he was not worried about getting hurt.
Mamby won the World Boxing Council light welterweight title from South Korean Kim Sang-hyun in February 1980 by stopping him in the 14th round in Seoul.
He made his first defence against Esteban De Jesus of Puerto Rico, the only man to beat Roberto Duran over the Panamanian's first 73 professional fights.
Mamby, who frequently fought overseas, also defended against Thomas Americo in his native Indonesia and against Nigerian Obisia Nwankpa in Lagos before relinquishing the title to American Leroy Haley in a split decision in June 1982.
He traces his determination to a haunting tour of military duty in Vietnam.
I used to sit down with the guys, he reminisced about his fellow soldiers, I would listen to everybody, what they were going to do.
Maybe a month later, a few days later, they put them in body bags.
Whatever you want to do, you do it, I vowed.
This is what I like to do, so I'm doing it.
Mamby, son of a Jamaican father and a Spanish mother, takes his freedom of choice seriously.
When I was a kid, 20 years old, they sent me to war.
Now that I have a little age on me you're going to tell me what I fought for I'm not allowed to participate in. 
I fought for freedom, justice and equality.
Now here I am, 60 years old and you're going to tell me 'you can't fight, you're too old'.
Surrounded by the yellowed newspaper pictures of boxing greats taped to the dingy walls of John's Gym, Mamby recalled some memorable opponents, including Duran. 
He was knocking everybody out but I lasted for a decision, he said.
He was a good fighter but he wasn't the hardest fight I had.
The hardest fight I had was a guy from Indonesia named Thomas Americo.
 I fought him 15 rounds in the first championship bout in Indonesia.
Mamby grinned when he thought of De Jesus.
Every Puerto Rican in New York lost money, because they all bet I was going to lose and I knocked him out in the 13th round.
The best current boxer, according to Mamby, is Floyd Mayweather Jr. Mayweather is a good fighter but realistically, he wouldn't have stood up to Duran.
Mamby thinks that after two or three warm-up fights he would match up well against Briton Ricky Hatton, recognised by Ring Magazine as the world's best super lightweight, who lost to Mayweather in a welterweight title fight.
Athletic Bilbao were awarded a 2-1 victory and Real Betis were given a two-match stadium ban by the Spanish Football Federation's competition committee on Tuesday.
The ruling came after Saturday's Primera Liga match at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera stadium was abandoned in the 69th minute after Bilbao goalkeeper Armando was hit in the face by a bottle thrown from the stands.
Bilbao were winning the game 2-1 at the time and the RFEF said in a statement on their Web site The result will stand from when the game was stopped.
Betis will be fined 9,000 euros and will have their sporting facilities closed for two matches.
Both teams have 10 days to appeal the decision.
Committee president Alfredo Florez told reporters there had been exceptional circumstances that had influenced their decision, and they had taken into account the fact that Betis fans quickly helped identify the aggressor to stadium security.
The game was given as completed because there were only a few minutes left and Bilbao had made already made all three substitutions, he said.
They would have had to continue with ten men and without a goalkeeper.
A Betis fan was standing in the front row just behind the goal at Saturday's game, when he threw a small plastic water bottle full of liquid at Armando, as he went to get a ball for a goal kick.
The visiting keeper was struck just below the right eye and required a number of stitches for a cut.
A 40-year-old Betis fan with the initials CPR, a builder from near Seville, has been charged with a public disorder offence and with causing injury.
Carmelo is really affected by all this because he is a true Betis fan, the accused's lawyer Alvaro Pimentel was quoted as saying in Spanish media on Tuesday.
All he asks now is that people show respect towards his family.
Betis had been petitioning for the remaining 21 minutes of the game to be completed, while Bilbao had called for tough sanctions and to be given the points.
Both teams are involved in the battle to avoid relegation. 
It is not the first time such an incident has occurred at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera.
Last season, Sevilla coach Juande Ramos, now at Tottenham Hotspur, was knocked out after being hit by a bottle thrown from the stands during a King's Cup quarter-final match there.
That game was abandoned and the remaining 33 minutes played behind closed doors at Getafe's stadium while Betis were given a three-match stadium ban.
Inter Milan moved seven points clear at the top of Serie A on Wednesday despite drawing 1-1 at Genoa, after second-placed AS Roma lost 3-2 to Lazio in a thrilling city derby.
A late Marco Borriello goal earned Genoa a point after Honduran striker David Suazo scored in the 12th minute for Inter, who had Portuguese midfielder Pele sent off for a second yellow just before halftime.
Roma were sunk by a stoppage-time winner from Lazio's Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami.
Goran Pandev and Tommaso Rocchi also scored for Lazio with Rodrigo Taddei and Simone Perrotta on target for Roma.
Third-placed Juventus have 55 points from 29 games, 13 fewer than Inter, after being held to a goalless draw at struggling Empoli.
Fiorentina stay fourth and in control of Italy's final Champions League qualification slot despite losing 2-0 at Napoli, for whom Argentine striker Ezequiel Lavezzi hit a double.
Fifth-placed Milan remain four points behind the Florence side after losing 2-1 to Sampdoria at the San Siro.
Inter had looked comfortable after Suazo tucked away a sweet Zlatan Ibrahimovic cross until Pepe's harsh red card.
The home side then laid siege to Inter's goal in the second half and were rewarded five minutes from time when Borriello scissor-kicked home the rebound from a Julio Cesar save to claim his 17th league goal of the season.
Roma took the lead just after the half hour against lazio when a Behrami clearance ricocheted off Taddei's chest and into the goal.
Macedonia striker Pandev equalised for Lazio shortly before the break and Rocchi drilled home a penalty just before the hour after Rolando Bianchi was felled.
Italy midfielder Simone Perrotta then made it 2-2 and Roma had looked the more likely side to score a winner before Behrami's snatched it for Lazio.
At the San Siro Christian Maggio fired in from short range and midfielder Gennaro Delvecchio wriggled past Alessandro Nesta and slipped the ball home to put Sampdoria 2-0 up at halftime.
Manchester United opened up a three-point lead at the top of the Premier League on Wednesday with a 2-0 victory over Bolton Wanderers.
The prolific Cristiano Ronaldo inspired the Reds to a fourth consecutive league victory with two classy first-half goals.
In a rip-roaring London derby at White Hart Lane, Chelsea drew 4-4 with Tottenham Hotspur.

United have 70 points from 30 games, Arsenal have 67 and Chelsea have 65.
Bayern Munich scored two second-half goals to beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-0 in the German Cup semi-final on Wednesday.
France playmaker Franck Ribery and Miroslav Klose scored to lead the home side to victory over Wolfsburg, with former Bayern coach Felix Magath in charge, and into the final next month against Borussia Dortmund.
Bayern, who went into the game on a two-match losing streak, went ahead when Ribery caught up with a through ball from Germany striker Klose on the hour and beat Diego Benaglio with a
crisp low shot between the Wolfsburg goalkeeper's legs. 
Six minutes later an unmarked Klose tapped in from the right after Benaglio was only able to knock down a Lukas Podolski shot from the left.
Keeping alive Bayern's hopes of three titles this season in the German Cup, Bundesliga and UEFA Cup.
Dortmund beat second division Carl Zeiss Jena 3-0 in the first semi on Tuesday.
Getafe reached their second consecutive King's Cup final after drawing 1-1 away to Racing Santander in their semi-final second leg on Wednesday.
Michael Laudrup's side won the first leg 3-1 at home last month and survived a torrid time at the Sardinero after Pedro Munitis gave Racing an early lead.
They withstood intense pressure until the second-half dismissal of Racing striker Oscar Serrano, after which Francisco Casquero snatched a late equaliser.
Getafe, who face Bayern Munich in a UEFA Cup quarter-finals next month, lost 1-0 to Sevilla in their first final appearance last season.
They will meet either Valencia or Barcelona, who play the other semi-final second leg at the Mestalla on Thursday.
The scores are level at 1-1 The final is on April 16.
Getafe were penned back as last-four debutants Racing piled forward in search of an early breakthrough which they got after seven minutes.
Jorge Lopez collected a short corner and drilled a low ball across the face of the goal for forward Munitis to stab in from close range.
The rest of the half ebbed and flowed with both goalkeepers making important interventions.
Racing missed the clearest opening for a second just before the break.
Serrano's low cross found Mohamed Tchite sliding into the six-yard box but the striker somehow put the ball over the bar.
Racing stepped up the pressure again after the break and it was one-way traffic as Gonzalo Colsa, Tchite and Ebi Smolarek all went close.
But the second yellow card for Serrano in the 76th minute proved the turning point.
Five minutes later, Getafe worked the ball across the edge of the area to substitute Casquero who lashed a shot high into the net.
Racing complained bitterly as defender Ezequiel Garay went down injured in the build up to the goal, and tempers boiled over in the tunnel after the final whistle.
Fifth division Carquefou caused a French Cup sensation by knocking out 10-times winners Olympique Marseille with a 1-0 win on Wednesday to reach the quarter-finals.
The amateurs from a small western town near Nantes moved in front after seven minutes through Senegalese midfielder Papa Idrissa N'Doye.
Marseille never recovered.
Playing before a 35,000 crowd in Nantes, Carquefou fought bravely and resisted under sustained but clumsy pressure from their prestigious opponents until the final whistle.
The amateurs, who had eliminated Ligue 1 frontrunners Nancy in the previous round, then embarked on a lap of honour to a standing ovation.
Ligue 1 title contenders Girondins Bordeaux had earlier needed two goals in extra time to beat Lille 2-0.
Brazilian midfielder Fernando exploited a blunder by the visitors' defence to put Bordeaux in front 96 minutes into a dull affair.
Bordeaux, lying second in the league standings, then needed a superb save from goalkeeper Ulrich Rame from a close-range effort by Lille striker Nicolas Fauvergue to stay in front.
Forward David Bellion put the issue beyond doubt by heading home a Franck Jurietti cross on 114 minutes.
Two Karim Benzema goals gave Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon a 2-1 win over holders Sochaux on Tuesday.
Defending champion Rafael Nadal came from a set down and 3-5 behind in the third to scrape past Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-7 7-6 7-5 in the Pacific Life Open fourth round on Wednesday.
In a repeat of this year's Australian Open semi-final in which Tsonga upset the Spaniard, Nadal gained revenge by winning a fluctuating encounter in just over three hours.
The second seed claimed the last four games as Tsonga's high-risk strategy ultimately backfired and will next meet either Frenchman Richard Gasquet or American James Blake who were playing later on Wednesday.
On a sun-drenched afternoon at Indian Wells Tennis Garden, Nadal and Tsonga traded service breaks in the first two games of the match on the showpiece Stadium Court and then held serve to take the opening set into a tiebreak.
Although the long-haired Spaniard established a 3-1 lead, Tsonga dominated the rest of the tiebreak.
A searing forehand winner down the line put the 22-year-old Frenchman 4-3 up, an ace took him to 6-3 and he clinched the set 7-4 when left-hander Nadal hit a forehand long.
The second set also began with successive breaks of serve before the two baseline sluggers went into another tiebreak which the Spaniard won 7-3 after surging 5-0 clear.
Both players held serve in the third set until the sixth game when Nadal, who had controlled a protracted rally, over-hit a forehand to be broken and trail 2-4.
Tsonga appeared to be in control when leading 5-3 and serving for the match but he was broken by Nadal in an erratic game that ended when he pushed an explosive forehand wide.
The 17th-seeded Frenchman was again broken in the 11th, double-faulting before hitting another forehand long for the Spaniard to go 6-5 up.
Urged on by the crowd, Nadal served out to seal victory, clinching the final point with an overhead smash.
The aggressive Tsonga, nicknamed Ali for his resemblance to the former world heavyweight boxing champion, ended the match with an overall tally of 47 winners and 56 unforced errors.
Earlier, unseeded Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka beat South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik 6-1 5-7 6-4 to set up a quarter-final clash with Serb Novak Djokovic or Argentina's Guillermo Canas.
Third-seeded Djokovic was scheduled to play Canas later on Wednesday and Swiss world number one Roger Federer was due to face Croat Ivan Ljubicic in an evening match.
The United States will prepare for 2010 World Cup qualifying with a friendly international against England in London in May, organisers said on Wednesday.
The match is scheduled for May 28 at Wembley Stadium and will be the American team's first visit to England since 1994.
We have consistently said that one of our goals is to play matches against good opponents and in environments that will really challenge our team.
In addition to the quality of the English team, the tradition and passion for the sport in that country, the media focus, and the intensity of the fans all combine to make this a fantastic opportunity for our group.
The U.S. have also lined up European friendlies against Poland on March 26 and Spain on June 4.
Ligue 1 bottom club Metz will be docked a point and must play a home match behind closed doors after a racist incident there last month, the French Professional Football League said on Thursday.
Morocco defender Abdeslam Ouaddou, the Valenciennes captain, was racially abused by a Metz fan during the Ligue 1 match at Metz on Feb. 16.
Metz said they would seek legal counsel over the League's decision.
We are surprised by the harshness of the sanction, they said on their Web site.
In the coming days, we will talk with our lawyers in order to find the best way to respond to this decision.
Metz now have 17 points from 30 matches and trail 17th placed Racing Lens, who are just above safety, by 17 points. 
Real Betis protested on Thursday after the Spanish Football Federation ordered them to play Saturday's league game against Barcelona at Atletico Madrid's ground because of a two-match stadium ban.
Betis said the decision could cause problems because city rivals Sevilla play Real Madrid in the Spanish capital the following day.
One of the most serious things that can happen is that for the first time in the history of football, fans from the four teams that have the greatest rivalry could coincide in the same city, Betis lawyer Jaime Rodriguez Sacristan told Radio Betis. 
I'm not saying this because of the fans, because they now get on well, but for the danger of bringing together such large numbers of rival fans.
It is almost an act of terrorism because terrorism puts the life of others in danger.
Betis received the punishment after Athletic Bilbao keeper Armando was cut on the face when a fan threw a bottle of water at him during a recent league match at their Ruiz de Lopera stadium.
The game was abandoned with Bilbao leading 2-1, with the RFEF subsequently deciding that the result should stand and that Betis be banned from their stadium for two matches.
Concern about violence in Spanish football was also raised when television showed images of an Atletico Madrid fan being kicked and beaten by Sevilla supporters before last Saturday's league match in Seville.
The United States will rely on the same quartet that won last year's Davis Cup when they face France in next month's quarter-final, captain Patrick McEnroe said on Thursday.
Andy Roddick, James Blake, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan will participate in their record tenth consecutive tie together, said McEnroe.
These guys have been amazing in their commitment to playing for their country and playing Davis Cup, McEnroe told a teleconference.
I give them all the credit in the world.
The best-of-five tie will be played on a fast Premiere hard court, which McEnroe said should help the Americans, and take place in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on April 11-13.
Roddick, the 2003 U.S. Open champion, has a 27-9 record in Davis Cup singles, while James is 15-8.
The Bryan brothers, the top doubles team in the world, are 14-1.
The four beat Russia 4-1 in the 2007 championship tie.
I'm thrilled we're going to be able to play a match at home as the champions, said McEnroe.
That was something I was really hoping we'd be able to do this year.
Obviously, I'm hoping we can win it again.
But I really wanted the guys to come out in a home tie as the Davis Cup champs.
France is expected to counter with eighth-ranked Richard Gasquet and Australian Open finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in singles, and Wimbledon champions Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra in doubles.
They're all dangerous, McEnroe said of the French squad.
Each match individually could be a grand slam semi-final.
Each side could make an argument they could win each match.
I don't think there's one particular player we're worried about.
We're worried about all of them.
McEnroe said Mardy Fish, who defeated world number one Roger Federer in straight sets at Indian Wells last week, will be a reserve player and practice with the team.
The British Broadcasting Corporation said Thursday it had asked police to investigate after details of more than 400 staff being sent to cover the Olympics in Beijing went missing.
The broadcaster said it fears that the two paper files containing passport details may have been stolen from its headquarters in Shepherd's Bush, west London.
We can confirm that we are undertaking a full investigation into how two files containing accreditation information for the Beijing Olympics have gone missing from a private office in Television Centre, a spokesman said.
We believe these files may have been stolen, and following our own investigation, we have now involved the police.
The information in the files includes passport details, he said.
We are in the process of contacting everyone involved and are also reviewing our internal security as a matter of urgency.
The publicly-funded BBC is sending 437 people to cover the August 8-24 Olympics.
Top-ranked Argentina will play the United States in a football friendly June 8 at Giants Stadium near New York in what will be the final tuneup for both before World Cup 2010 qualifying matches.
US Soccer announced Thursday that Argentina will visit East Rutherford, New Jersey for the final US men's friendly at the former World Cup venue, which is being replaced by a new Meadowlands stadium.
Argentina is 6-2 against the US men, who last beat their South American rivals 1-0 at Washington in 1999.
The Argentine squad ranks second in South American qualifying for the 2010 World Cup with a 3-1 record.
It will return home for a qualifier June 14 against Colombia and visit Brazil three days later to face their arch rivals.
The US team will open South Africa 2010 World Cup qualifying June 15 in Los Angeles against Barbados in the first leg of a home and home series that concludes on the Caribbean island June 21 or 22.
US tuneups for those matches include playing England at London on May 28 and Spain at Santander on June 4 before meeting Argentina.
Argentina is clearly one of the best teams in the world and playing against an opponent of that caliber is a great opportunity for our team, US coach Bob Bradley said.
We have put together a very good schedule to help us prepare for World Cup qualifying.
We expect a good crowd at Giants Stadium and we are looking forward to an exciting atmosphere.
The US men beat Poland 3-0 Wednesday at Krakow.
Turkey midfielder Hamit Altintop is likely to miss the rest of the season and is also doubtful for Euro 2008 after suffering a broken metatarsal.
Altintop had surgery in Germany after injuring his foot in Turkey's 2-2 draw with Belarus on Wednesday, his club Bayern Munich said in a statement.
It's a shock, Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said on Thursday.
It's doubtful whether he'll be able to play again this season.
Turkey are in Group A at Euro 2008 in Switzerland and Austria.
World champion Casey Stoner returns to Spain on Sunday looking to conquer a track which has nothing but painful memories for him.
The Andalucian circuit was one of only four races where the Australian Ducati rider failed to record a podium finish in his world title winning campaign in 2007.
To add insult to injury, he then suffered an embarrassing fall in testing in November which left him with a damaged shoulder.
However, he shrugged off that setback to win the opening race of the 2008 season under floodlights in Qatar three weeks ago.
You could say that Jerez last year wasn't one of our best races, but winter testing went well here and with the general improvements we've made since last year I think we can be competitive this weekend, said Stoner.
The Australian was fifth here last year in a race where five-time MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi celebrated his 85th career win but his first in six races.
There are a lot of riders who have started the season strongly, added Stoner.
Especially the rookies, amongst them riders who will want more of the same and riders racing at home, so they will be very motivated.
One of the rookies who will be the centre of interest for the expected 120,000 crowd will be 20-year-old local Jorge Lorenzo, who moved into the top flight MotoGP series after winning the last two 250cc titles.
He was second in Qatar and celebrated his finish by eating a lollipop on the podium.
It was a stunning performance from the young Spaniard who even outpaced Yamaha teammate Rossi who was only fifth.
Qatar was unbelievable and something I will remember forever.
I never expected to be going into only my second MotoGP race in such a great position, said Lorenzo.
However, I know it will be hard work for me again in Jerez.
In November at the test I had some difficulties but in February I did one of my best laps of the whole winter.
Jerez for me last year was a fantastic race, I took pole position and the victory and I also won in 2006 so I have some great memories of racing here.
Jerez is undoubtedly a special track for me.
Rossi enjoys his trips to Spain.
In 1996, he took the first of his six victories in all classes at Jerez.
Five of those have come in the MotoGP class, including with Yamaha in 2005 and 2007.
But the 29-year-old is without a win since Estoril last year and he must win if he is to avoid his longest winless streak since his debut MotoGP victory at Donington in 2000.
Qatar didn't turn out quite as we hoped but we took away a lot of positives from the weekend, said the Italian.
Jerez is a great track for me and I have had some wonderful races there in the past, including a brilliant win last year.
A controversial penalty three minutes into added time gave Paris St Germain a 2-1 win over fellow Ligue 1 strugglers Racing Lens in the French League Cup final at the Stade de France on Saturday.
Substitute midfielder Bernard Mendy scored the winner from the spot after referee Laurent Duhamel ruled that Lens defender Hilton had fouled forward Peguy Luyindula.
The offence looked far from obvious and the penalty decision was met by deafening boos from the Lens fans, whose team had fought back from a goal down and were hoping for extra time.
I feel we've been robbed and Mr Duhamel robbed us, Lens coach Jean-Pierre Papin told French television channel France 3.
To lose a final that way is a scandal, the former France striker added.
PSG, who dominated the first half of a lively game but struggled in the second, were not complaining after lifting the trophy for the third time following their success in 1995 and 1998 and winning a ticket to next season's UEFA Cup.
It was a great final with a half from each side and little bit of luck from us at the end, PSG defender Sylvain Armand told France 3.
Former Portugal striker Pauleta, the PSG captain, opened the scoring by flicking the ball over goalkeeper Ronan Le Crom from inside the area after 19 minutes.
Lens stepped up a gear after the break to equalise with a low angled shot from the edge of the area by midfielder Eric Carriere that bounced off the post into the net in the 52nd.
PSG had created the first chance in the match after five minutes when forward Amara Diane raced down the right and crossed for Pauleta, whose close range effort was deflected over the bar by Lens defender Adama Coulibaly.
Lens reacted after dropping behind with a fine solo run by forward Toifilou Maoulida and powerful drive from just inside the box that brought a superb save from Mickael Landreau just before the half-hour mark.
The northerners then came close to scoring two minutes into the second half when a header from midfielder Kader Mangane was deflected by PSG defender Ceara and went just wide.
Lens kept the pressure up after equalising and threatened to take the lead with a shot from 20 metres by midfielder Olivier Monterrubio that hit the post after 69 minutes and Maoulida's diving header that flew just wide two minutes later.
PSG, third from bottom in Ligue 1, and Lens, a place above them, must now focus of the battle against relegation after an entertaining final ended in bitter defeat the northerners.
Citroen's Sebastien Loeb was poised to take the championship lead and celebrate a fourth Rally Argentina win in a row after an untroubled second leg on Saturday.
The four times world champion ended the day's 17th stage in Cordoba province's Calamuchita valley with a comfortable advantage of one minute 20.1 seconds over Subaru's Norwegian Petter Solberg.
Australian Chris Atkinson, also driving a Subaru, was in third place and a further 46.9 seconds back with only Saturday's 1.78-km super-special in Cordoba soccer stadium and three stages on Sunday remaining.
Spain's Dani Sordo was fourth for Citroen with Zimbabwean Conrad Rautenbach fifth in a privately-entered Citroen.
Real Madrid beat Sevilla 3-1 at the Bernabeu to move six points clear at the top of the Primera Liga on Sunday.
Gabriel Heinze headed them in front early on and Raul restored the lead just before the break, a minute after Frederic Kanoute had levelled for the visitors.
Gonzalo Higuain sealed a relatively comfortable victory in the second half, to leave the champions on 65 points with eight games left to play.
Their closest challengers are now Villarreal on 59, after they leap-frogged Barcelona with a convincing 3-0 home win over fourth-placed Atletico Madrid on Saturday.
Barca are third with 58 points after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 away to Real Betis, also on Saturday.
It's another small step towards the title but we have to keep on fighting, Real president Ramon Calderon told Canal Plus television.
Villarreal are now the team closest to us but I'm sure Barcelona haven't given up on the title just yet.
Racing Santander beat Espanyol 3-0 away to close on the Champions League places in fifth.
Early goals from Oscar Serrano and Pedro Munitis put Marcelino's side on course for the victory, and a cheeky strike from Ivan Bolado at the end left them level on 50 points with Atletico.
After consecutive wins over Barca and Real, King's Cup finalists Valencia returned to earth with a 3-0 defeat against Real Mallorca at the Mestalla.
Mallorca's Spain striker Daniel Guiza scored twice taking his tally for the season to 17.
Valencia's Cup final opponents and UEFA Cup quarter-finalists Getafe also lost at home as they fell 2-0 to Osasuna.
Michael Laudrup's side were reduced to ten men when Cosmin Contra was sent off after 30 minutes and never recovered as Miguel Flano and Patxi Punal secured the points for the visitors.
Real got an early breakthrough when Argentina defender Heinze headed home Wesley Sneijder's free kick after eight minutes, notching his first goal for the club.
David Prieto's last ditch tackle denied Guti a quick second for Real soon after, as Sevilla were constantly opened up by the home side's rapid counter-attacks.
The Andalucians pulled one back against the run of play in the 38th minute when Daniel Alves's freekick was headed back into the area by Seydou Keita, for Mali striker Kanoute to volley home.
But Real quickly restored their advantage when Sneijder picked out Raul with his back to goal, and the 30-year-old turned and squeezed a rising shot just inside the post.
A spectacular double save by Andres Palop from Argentine striker Higuain in the second half kept Sevilla in the game, but he was helpless to prevent the third goal in the 65th, as Higuain buried Guti's cross at the end of a slick passing move.
Sunday's Serie A game between Juventus and Parma was postponed after a Parma fan was accidentally knocked down and killed by a bus following a dispute with rival supporters.
Given the tragic fatality, the two clubs have decided that it would not be right to send the teams on the field, a joint statement said.
All other Serie A matches went ahead on Sunday with a minute's silence held for the fan, named as Matteo Bagnaresi.
Police said some Parma and Juve fans were trading insults at a service station en route to Turin where the accident happened.
There were the usual insulting phrases, highway police spokesman Alessandria Ovest said.
In order to avoid trouble, the coach of Juve fans left, but obviously the driver was not aware that there was a fan in front and he hit him with the forward part of the vehicle.
The driver is now under investigation.
In November, before the reverse set of fixtures to Sunday's, Lazio fan Gabriele Sandri was shot and killed by a police officer following scuffles with Juve fans at a service station near Arezzo.
Sandri's death, the second in a year connected to football violence in Italy, caused riots and the suspension of the league for a week.
Sunday's incident, although not a direct result of violence, has still led to calls for away travel in Italy to be banned.
Media reports said Bagnaresi was a member of an ultra group and had just been allowed to enter stadiums again after a three-year ban for a previous incident with Juventus fans.
It was right but it is hypocritical because the problem is deeper.
Away travel for fans should be totally prohibited, at least for a long period, Massimo Montebove, a spokesman for the Turin police trade union, told ANSA news service.
Tough restrictions are already in place on visiting supporters following November's trouble and teams are often prevented from not taking fans to high-risk games.
AS Roma take on Manchester United in the Champions League on Tuesday with security set to be tight following trouble in their previous encounters in Rome.
A decision on when the Juve-Parma game will be rearranged is expected to be taken on Monday with April 16 a possible date.
Juve are third in Serie A, seven points behind second-placed AS Roma.
They will now have a game in hand with eight matches remaining in their season.
Olympique Lyon stayed on course for a seventh consecutive Ligue 1 title by winning 2-1 at mid-table Valenciennes on Sunday.
Lyon's sixth successive league win put them on 67 points from 31 games, nine ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux with seven matches left.
Ivory Coast forward Kader Keita was the key to Lyon's victory, opening the scoring on eight minutes before setting up France striker Sidney Govou for the winner in the 64th minute.
Defender Eric Chelle had brought Valenciennes level with a header from a corner in the 27th minute.
Bordeaux, fighting to hold on to second place for automatic qualification for the Champions League, beat third-placed Nancy 2-1 on Saturday.
Olympique Marseille kept alive their hopes of a top-three finish by winning 2-1 at Lorient in Sunday's late match.
The former European champions, who had picked just one point from their last two league outings, recaptured their winning ways and stayed fourth but closed the gap on Nancy to three points.
Lorient moved in front shortly before halftime with a penalty from Algeria midfielder Rafik Saifi but the visitors responded after the break with goals from Ivory Coast midfielder Kanga Akale and Senegal striker Mamadou Niang.
The top two from Ligue 1 make the Champions League with the third-placed team entering the showcase competition's qualifying round.
Citroen's Sebastien Loeb won Rally Argentina on Sunday to go top of the world championship standings.
The Frenchman finished two minutes 33.2 seconds ahead of Subaru's Chris Atkinson of Australia to win the race for a fourth year in a row.
Spain's Daniel Sordo was third, a further one minute 31.5 seconds behind, in a Citroen.
Loeb moved into first place on Friday when Ford's championship leader Mikko Hirvonen hit a rock and crashed out while leading.
Hirvonen resumed on Saturday in 25th place and eventually finished fifth.
Loeb was able to drive through the final two days and leapt to the top of the championship, five points clear of Hirvonen.
After clocking up the 39th win of his career, the four-times world champion said conditions in Cordoba province were the most difficult he had encountered.
I like difficult conditions but I thought today's were the hardest I've ever faced, he told the official wrc.com Web site.
The conditions were extremely bad today, but throughout the event we've had some extremely tricky weather too.
It seems to have been raining all the time and with the fog and the mud on the road it was very difficult.
In some places it was very hard to keep the car on the road at all.
Yes, we see fog, rain and mud on other rallies, but up to now we've always been able to choose an appropriate tyre for the conditions.
Subaru's Norwegian Petter Solberg began the day in second place but his hopes were dashed halfway through the opening stage when total electrical failure brought his car to a halt.
VfB Stuttgart failed to take advantage of a series of mishaps above them when they were held to a goalless draw away to Hanover 96 on Sunday.
Stuttgart, last season's champions, had the chance to move within a point of the Champions League places after the top five had all failed to win on Saturday but Armin Veh's side succumbed to the same bout of vertigo.
Mario Gomez missed their best chance, putting a free header from a few metres out far too close to goalkeeper Robert Enke when he seemed certain to score at the end of the first half.
A draw kept Stuttgart sixth on 42 points, three behind Schalke in the third and final Champions League spot.
With eight games left, Bayern Munich lead the standings with 54 points following a 1-1 derby draw at Nuremberg on Saturday.
Hamburg SV, held 1-1 by Arminia Bielefeld, are second on 47.
Schalke, who drew 0-0 at Karlsruhe on Saturday, are third on 45, one ahead of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen following their defeats by Eintracht Frankfurt and Duisburg.
In Sunday's other game Energie Cottbus moved out of the bottom three with a 2-1 win at home to Hertha Berlin, Albania's Ervin Skeller getting both goals with a free kick and a penalty.
Argentina's Andres Romero fired a final round four-under 68 to seal a one-shot victory over Australian Peter Lonard at the New Orleans Classic on Sunday, his maiden U.S. PGA Tour title.
Romero, one of 46 players forced to finish his third round on Sunday, mixed five birdies with a bogey on the TPC Louisiana layout and watched from the clubhouse to see if his 13-under total of 275 would withstand a back-nine challenge from Lonard.
A tap-in birdie at the par-four 16th moved Lonard into a share of the lead but the Australian's hopes of a first PGA Tour win in three years slipped away with a bogey at the par-three 17th.
Needing another birdie at the 18th to force a playoff, Lonard settled for par and a final-round 69 left him in second place on 12-under 276.
Romero's previous best PGA Tour finish was a tie for third at the 2007 British Open.
New Zealand's Tim Wilkinson signed for a five-under 67 to finish alone in third on 11-under 277 with British Open champion Padraig Harrington and Americans Woody Austin
Rafael Nadal survived the distraction of a rain delay to post a 6-2, 6-4 win over German Nicolas Kiefer for a place in the third round of the Miami Masters on Sunday.
I'm very happy about my victory, said the Spaniard who is searching for his first title this season.
When I come back to the court the ball was a little bigger and slower, and it was a little bit more difficult for me.
I feel I played a very complete match.
The second seed will next face 16th seed Paul-Henri Mathieu of France, who beat Spanish veteran Carlos Moya.
Number nine James Blake ousted crafty French veteran Fabrice Santoro.
I don't really relax until match point is over with, so I was definitely worried, said Blake.
He could have picked up his level at any point and played great, put the pressure on me.
Number 10 Tomas Berdych stopped Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-1, 6-3.
Women's number 33 Lindsay Davenport rolled back the years nine months after giving birth as she sent second seed Ana Ivanovic out in the third round 6-4, 6-2.
She played like a top-10 player easily today, said a stunned Ivanovic, one week removed from winning the prestigious title at Indian Wells, California.
Davenport, seemed surprised to have gone through: Sometimes you just never know what to expect when you go out for a certain match on a certain day.
Ivanovic, who followed compatriot and men's Indian Wells winner Novak Djokovic out the door early in Florida, said that Davenport 
Won Grand Slams before, and she was the number one player, so she has the game.
Today she played very well.
I'm glad to see her back, and I hope she can do well.
The gracious response masked the obvious disappointment of Ivanovic, who had hoped to back up her first major title.
She always had the first hit on her ball.
It was kind of disappointing for me, Ivanovic said.
I had chances in the beginning and didn't use them.
My intensity wasn't up there today.
When you play against such a champion, you need to be on the ball for each point.
Intensity was not a worry for number one Justine Henin, who overcame sweltering mid-day conditions to advance over Italy's Sara Errani 6-2, 6-1.
Fourth seed Jelena Jankovic got back onto court less than 24 hours after managing a marathon win the night before, wasting no time in crushing Czech Lucie Safarova 6-2, 6-1.
Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2006 champion, had to mount a huge fightback to escape Viktoria Azarenka.
Juventus reached the Italian Cup quarter-finals after beating Serie A strugglers Empoli 5-3 in a Turin thriller on Tuesday to advance 6-5 on aggregate.
An under-strength Juve lost 2-1 at Empoli in December's first leg and Claudio Ranieri's decision to field a few of his big guns in the return match paid early dividends when Marco Marchionni burst through the defence to score.
Pavel Nedved doubled the lead on 10 minutes but an injury to defender Giorgio Chiellini knocked Juve off their stride.
Empoli capitalised when Luca Antonini slid in to pull one back and Nicola Pozzi produced an excellent header to bring the scores level on the night.
Italy forward Vincenzo Iaquinta then struck twice for Juve either side of Pozzi's second before substitute Alessandro Del Piero sealed the home side's passage with a penalty.
Holders AS Roma will go out unless they can overcome a 3-1 first-leg deficit in Wednesday's second leg at home to Torino while AC Milan are also in arrears as they travel to Catania.
Rafa Benitez finally got some good news as Steven Gerrard's hat-trick helped Liverpool cruise into the FA Cup fourth round with a 5-0 win against crisis ridden League One outfit Luton on Tuesday.
Benitez's position looks increasingly untenable after Liverpool's American owners admitted they held talks with Jurgen Klinsmann over the manager's job late last year.
But the Spaniard at least avoided an embarrassing third round replay defeat thanks to Gerrard's treble and goals from Ryan Babel and Sami Hyypia at Anfield.
Liverpool's stars ran riot in the second half and advanced to a tie against Conference South club Havant and Waterlooville or League One Swansea in the next round.
Luton had out-played and out-fought Liverpool for long periods when they drew 1-1 at Kenilworth Road.
Benitez's side, captained by Jamie Carragher on his 500th appearance, didn't take them for granted this time.
The breakthrough arrived in first half stoppage time when Fernando Torres fed Babel and the Dutch winger's low shot arrowed home.
Gerrard scored from close range in the 52nd minute before Hyypia glanced in a header five minutes later.
A 64th minute strike from Gerrard made it four and the England midfielder completed his first hat-trick for over two years in the 72nd minute.
Benitez refused to be drawn on his future, saying: I wasn't thinking much about it.
We were really thinking about this game because we knew it was important to progress in the FA Cup.
I'm really pleased because we won 5-0 and played a good game, added the implacable Spaniard.
Robbie Keane's 99th goal for Tottenham gave his side a 1-0 win at Reading.
Keane struck in the first half at the Madejski Stadium to earn Juande Ramos's men a trip to Manchester United.
Dimitar Berbatov was sidelined with flu as Ramos made five changes but Keane made sure the Bulgaria striker wasn't missed.
Spurs had the better of it from the moment Keane pounced from close range in the 15th minute.
Younes Kaboul had driven Jermaine Jenas's corner against the crossbar and Keane was perfectly placed to slot home.
Managerless Bury stunned Norwich as the League Two side beat their Championship opponents 2-1 at Gigg Lane.
Bury sacked Chris Casper and director of football Keith Alexander on Monday and the decision appeared to work wonders.
They went ahead in the 18th minute at Gigg Lane through Ben Futcher.
Andy Bishop increased Bury's lead in the 61st minute and, although veteran Dion Dublin gave Norwich hope in the 86th minute, the hosts held on to earn a trip to Southampton
Championship leaders West Bromwich held their nerve in a penalty shoot-out against Charlton to set up a fourth round clash at Peterborough.
Tony Mowbray's team blew a two-goal lead as they were held 2-2 after extra-time at the Hawthorns, but Charlton missed two of their five spot-kicks in the shoot out and Albion won 4-3.
The hosts took the lead in the 14th minute when Roman Bednar met Zoltan Gera's header with a tap-in.
Albion looked certain to go through when James Morrison added the second goal in the 51st minute.
But Darren Ambrose reduced the deficit in the 64th minute and Chris Dickson sent the tie to extra-time with a 90th minute equaliser.
Millwall, 2004 FA Cup finalists, will travel to Coventry after beating League One rivals Walsall 2-1 at the New Den.
Kenny Jackett's side went ahead in the 15th minute when Ben May drove home from the edge of the area.
Gary Alexander put Millwall in control when he scored four minutes into the second half.
Alex Nicholls pulled one back for the visitors in the 61st minute but it failed to stop Walsall suffering their first defeat in 19 matches.
Sheffield Wednesday's clash against Premiership tailenders Derby was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Hillsborough.
Derby's fellow Premiership strugglers Fulham's trip to Bristol Rovers and Barnet's tie against Swindon suffered the same fate.
This month's WBC flyweight title fight between champion Daisuke Naito of Japan and Thai Pongsaklek Wongjongkam has been postponed after Naito requested more time to prepare, local media reported on Wednesday.
The Japanese claim their fighter has been busy so they say they will move the fight back one month, promoter Piyarat Wachirattanawong was quoted as saying.
We are satisfied because Pongsaklek will have more time to prepare.
The eagerly awaited rematch, which had been slated for Jan. 28 in Saraburi, Thailand, would have been Pongsaklek's first chance to win back the title he defended 17 times in six years before the surprise loss to Naito last July.
Spain's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso was the fastest driver here on Tuesday on the second day of Formula one testing that marked his return to Renault after a tempestuous season at McLaren.
Alonso, who won back-to-back world championships with Renault in 2005 and 2006 and came close last year with McLaren, went around in one minute 19.503 seconds to finish with the fastest lap time at the Circuito de Jerez.
I don't have concrete goals for this competition.
Personally it's an opportunity to become acclimatized to driving a single-seat car without electronic aids, he said.
Renault has adapted last season's car for testing by removing driver aids which have been banned under new Formula One rules.
It's the first time that I have driven without traction control but by the end of my runs I started to go faster and take more risks with the car.
The first day of testing was definitely very positive, he added.
Alonso's season at McLaren was marked by an intense rivalry with his team-mate Lewis Hamilton.
Spanish champions Real Madrid's hopes of a treble this season were shattered on Wednesday as Real Mallorca gained a shock 1-0 win at the Bernabeu to secure a 3-1 win on aggregate in their last 16 Kings Cup clash and inflict the hosts first home defeat of the season.
An 83rd minute goal by Mallorca's 31-year-old Argentinian playmaker Angel Miguel Ibagaza on the counter-attack was enough to see the Balearic Island side through as like Ibagaza, in his second spell at the club, they seek to add a second Kings Cup title in five years.
Real Madrid, who had hoped to land the Kings Cup along with the Primera Liga title and the Champions League, had plenty of chances to progress to the last eight even without the services of talismanic captain Raul, who was rested for the match along with 'keeper Iker Casillas.
However, despite going close on seven occasions, two of those opportunities falling to Argentinian Javier Saviola and the final one to his half-time replacement Ruud van Nistelrooy they were unable to crack the Mallorca defence and will have to wait another season to see if they can end their drought in the competition which goes back to 1993.
On Tuesday Barcelona ended Sevilla's reign as King's Cup holders as a dull 0-0 draw was sufficient to see the Catalan giants through.
Barcelona progressed thanks to the away goal rule as the first leg had finished 1-1.
With both sides missing several key players as they had either been called away on African Nations Cup duty or were suspended and injured, the quality of the game naturally slipped a notch or two from their previous encounters.
It was the hosts who came closest to scoring in the first-half as first Thierry Henry shot over the bar in the 32nd minute and then two minutes later another former Premiership player Eidur Gudjohnsen had his shot stopped twice by the Sevilla 'keeper.
The second-half saw Barcelona easily counter any resistance, which was slight, that Sevilla could offer, though, they did give the hosts a moment of concern as highly-rated fullback Daniel Alves rattled the bar with a freekick seven minutes from time.
Defeat leaves Sevilla effectively with just the Champions League to play for this season, as they are 10 points adrift of Real Madrid in the title race.
Barcelona will face Villarreal in the last eight after the latter edged Huelva 2-1 on aggregate, 2-0 on the night, but only after extra-time.
Resurgent Paris Saint Germain booked their spot in the French League Cup semi-finals on Wednesday with a 4-0 rout of Valenciennes as Japan midfielder Daisuke Matsui ensured Le Mans' passage at the expense of Lyon.
Three days after achieving just their first win of the season at Parc des Princes, PSG confirmed their form with a victory which came despite being reduced to ten men after six minutes when Colombian defender Mario Yepes was given his marching orders for a tackle on Slovak defender Filip Sebo.
Ivorian striker Amara Diane, who scored a double in their 3-0 win over Lens on Sunday, repeated the feat with goals after 55 and 61 minutes.
Pauleta had opened for the hosts after two minutes when he converted a penalty with Jerome Rothen completing the scoreline after 67 minutes.
PSG coach Paul Le Guen said: Today I'm happy with the score but above all the qualification, our ability to battle.
Even if we had difficulties the team remained united throughout the match.
We never gave up.
But he warned: We have to remain vigilant.
We mustn't get carried away.
Meanwhile Matsui ensured hosts Le Mans a victory in what was sweet revenge for their demise to the same opponents in last season's last four clash.
Matsui's powerful 29th-minute strike toppled the six-time French champions in a match which had been postponed from Tuesday because of strong winds at the Leon-Bollee Stadium.
Alain Perrin's Lyon were sorely missing midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa, who picked up a thigh injury in training and was replaced by the inexperienced Loic Remy.
Perrin bemoaned their exiting even if it is the lowest of his priorities in terms of silverware this season.
It is a reverse, that is certain, said the former Troyes, Portsmouth and Marseille handler.
We paid for our first-half performance where we just did not play the match as if it were a Cup match.
For his Le Mans counterpart Rudi Garcia, it was a case of vastly different emotions.
This is a huge achievement by my players.
We will savour this victory.
Victory has gone to the side that wanted it the most.
Without their African players Romaric and Ibrahima Camara, who returned to their national teams for the African Nations Cup, 27-year-old Matsui proved to be the stalwart of the Le Mans side.
Lyon lacked fire in their forward line with star striker Karim Benzema thwarted at every turn by the hosts as he lacked the support of his strike partners Milan Baros while Brazilian international Fred appeared for 10 minutes in what is likely to be his last appearance for the French side before a move to an English Premiership side.
Apart from solo attacks from Benzema, Lyon's best chance was a Juninho freekick three minutes before the break which was cleared by Jean Clave.
Le Mans' victory gives them a lift after they struggled to get past amateur side Selongey in the last round and a 2-0 loss at home to Sochaux at the weekend.
Top seed Roger Federer claimed his 16th consecutive match win at the Australian Open with a carefree straight sets win over French veteran Fabrice Santoro on Thursday.
The Swiss supremo countered the wiles of the 35-year-old Santoro, playing in a record 62nd Grand Slam, to cruise into the third round 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 in one hour and 22 minutes.
Federer, bidding for his 13th Grand Slam title, will take on Serbian Davis Cup team member Janko Tipsarevic in the next round.
I always enjoy playing a match against Fabrice, Federer said.
In the first match I played against him he totally dismantled me, he can really show where he could hurt you.
The victory stretched Federer's record over the 36th-ranked Santoro to 9-2 with four of his last five wins coming in Grand Slam tournaments.
Santoro, a rarity in modern men's tennis with his sliced forehand and clever use of angles, could only marvel and shake his head at times at the phenomenal shot-making of Federer.
Federer has been unrivalled as world number one since February 2004 and has won three of last year's four Grand Slams for the third time in four years.
But Federer comes into the Australian Open for the first time since 2004 Wimbledon with his top ranking under threat.
He could lose the position he has held with a record 207 consecutive weeks if he fails to reach the semi-finals and world number two Rafael Nadal goes on to win the Australian title.
Santoro's serve came under early pressure and the Frenchman was broken twice in the fourth and sixth games as Federer dominated with his groundstrokes.
He wrapped up the opening set in just 23 minutes, winning 27 points to Santoro's 12.
Again Santoro's service was broken in the opening game of the second set on Federer's fourth break point with it becoming apparent that Santoro didn't have the weapons to threaten the world number one.
But he delighted the crowd with his retrieving ability, scurrying around the back court and keeping the ball in play, some through his legs, for Federer to usually come up with the winner.
Santoro had a glimmer of opportunity with two break points in the second game, but the top seed denied him with consecutive aces to hold serve.
Federer broke Santoro's serve for a fourth time to lead 4-1 and had set point but the Frenchman fought it off in the seventh game.
The Swiss simply reeled off a love game and sealed the set with an ace.
Santoro was largely spent into the third set and dropped his opening two service games as Federer surged to victory without losing a game.
Russian second seed Svetlana Kuznetsova admitted she had an off day as she struggled to a hard-fought win over Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova to reach the Australian Open third round Thursday.
Kuznetsova started sluggishly but clawed her way back to a victory over Pironkova, ranked 94 in the world.
It was really hard, Tsvetana played really well and I just tried to stay in and play my best and in the end I came out a winner, she said.
The 22-year-old said her game simply failed to gel but she intended to improve as the season-opening Grand Slam progressed.
A Grand Slam is seven different games, some days it's very hard and you don't feel good, today was one of those days, she said.
Definitely I'd like to play better next time.
Kuznetsova gifted Pironkova an early service break and took 16 minutes to get on the board at 3-1, looking out-of-sorts as her second service misfired and unforced errors riddled her game.
Pironkova, meanwhile, was so eager to exploit the former US Open champion's weakness that she dropped her racquet at one point stretching for a forehand return.
The Bulgarian had her opponent on the ropes at set point on 5-3 but could not land a knockout blow, instead rousing Kuznetsova from her stupor.
The Monte Carlo-based Kuznetsova rallied to take the next four games before Pironkova broke her again to take the set to a tie-break, which the Russian took 7-0 as she asserted her authority.
The pair exchanged breaks early in the second set but Pironkova's challenge had run out of steam and Kuznetsova claimed victory after 91 minutes.
She will meet either Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska or Frenchwoman Pauline Parmentier in the third round.
Brazilian football legend Pele sought to temper expectations surrounding the nation's young phenom Alexander Pato, who made his Milan debut over the weekend and scored a goal in the 5-2 Serie A victory over Empoli.
I think they have put too great a responsibility on Pato, mainly because he scored a goal, Pele said Wednesday in an interview with the radio station Jovem Pan.
He is an above average player, but one should still be a little patient, because he is a footballer who is just starting out and he will soon face a man-to-man defence which will make his job harder, the football legend said.
Pato, rose through Internacional Porto Alegre's junior ranks and plays for Brazil's Under-20 national team.
He has only played 30 games as a professional to date.
Milan signed him for 20 million dollars in 2007 when the Italian transfer window re-opened after Pato turned 18 in September, but he has only just been allowed to make his official debut.
Young gun Novak Djokovic outclassed Italian Simone Bolelli to surge into the third round of the Australian Open with another straight sets demolition job on Thursday.
The Serbian third seed was on a higher plane to Bolelli and won as he pleased 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 in an hour 32 minutes on Vodafone Arena.
Djokovic, seeded to face Roger Federer in the semi-finals, will next play American Sam Querrey or Russian 32nd seed Dmitry Tursunov.
It's good to have a straight sets win, it's what you want at a Grand Slam, Djokovic said.
I played well but I struggled a little bit in the third set with my serve.
It was another impressive effort from the 20-year-old Serb, who crushed German Benjamin Becker in straight sets in the opening round.
He again controlled his match against the 70th-ranked Italian, cruising along with nine service breaks.
Djokovic comes to the year's first Grand Slam saddled with expectations that he might be the young gun to end the Federer domination of men's tennis.
He pushed Federer all the way in the final of last year's US Open and has ambitions of usurping the 12-time Grand Slam champion as world number one.
Last August he became the first player to beat the world number one and two, Federer and Rafael Nadal, in the same tournament at the ATP Masters series in Montreal since German great Boris Becker in 1994.
Djokovic is coming off a stellar 2007 when he finished as the youngest year-end top-10 player following five ATP titles and leading Serbia to Davis Cup victory over Australia.
Bolelli was ripped apart in the first set, losing his two opening service games to drop the set in 25 minutes.
He had no answer to the precision of the young Serb's groundstrokes and again lost service at the start of the second set.
The Italian, facing Djokovic for the first time, again lost serve in the fifth game in all one-way traffic for the third seed.
Bolelli started the final set no better, dropping service to love.
Djokovic developed some problems with his service and was taken to break point in the fourth game, but Bolelli was again broken in the seventh game, double-faulting on break point to leave the Serb to serve it out for victory.
Barcelona have agreed a deal to sign goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto on loan from second division Celta Vigo until the end of the season, the Primera Liga side said on Thursday.
Barca said the deal, which will cost the club 500,000 euros and which includes an option to buy the player, would be completed on Friday after the keeper undergoes a medical.
The 32-year-old has been signed to provide cover for first choice Victor Valdes after reserve keeper Albert Jorquera sustained a serious knee injury while playing for a Catalan selection team during the Christmas break.
Pinto, who joined Celta in 1999 from Real Betis, has made 126 appearances in the top flight and has experience of playing in the Champions League and UEFA Cup.
Seven times Tour de France cycling champion Lance Armstrong has entered the Boston Marathon on April 21, organisers said on Thursday.
Armstrong qualified for the 112th Boston Marathon with a time of two hours 46 minutes 43 seconds in last year's New York City Marathon.
The race will be the American's third marathon.
Following his retirement from professional cycling, Armstrong competed in the 2006 New York race and crossed the finish line in.
In Boston, cancer-survivor Armstrong will be raising money for the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which raises money for cancer prevention and care.
Chelsea were fined 40,000 pounds by the Football Association on Thursday after admitting a charge of failing to ensure their players conducted themselves correctly during a stormy 2-0 win over Derby in November.
Chelsea were charged after a posse of their players, led by captain John Terry, angrily confronted referee Andre Marriner following the red card he gave to Ghanaian midfielder Michael Essien for elbowing Kenny Miller in injury-time.
The incident caused a number of observers to question whether Terry's conduct was appropriate for a captain of England's national side and helped to fuel speculation about whether he will continue in the role under new head coach Fabio Capello.
Portuguese driver Alvaro Parente had a first taste of Formula One when he tested with former champions Renault at the Jerez circuit in southern Spain on Thursday.
Renault said in a statement that the 23-year-old, testing as the winner of the 2007 World Series by Renault junior championship, completed 64 laps at the wheel of last year's R27 car.
It was a fantastic day, with positive results in every sense, he said.
I hope I can use the experience to my advantage for the next stage of my career.
Top seed Justine Henin advanced to the fourth round of the Australian Open Friday after receiving her toughest workout so far at this year's event in a 7-5, 6-4 win over Italy's Francesca Schiavone.
The world number one was pushed all the way in the first set and had to pull off some stunning shots to keep 25th seed Schiavone at bay before taking control in the second.
It was really exciting, I was glad to win in two sets, Henin said.
She's always given me a lot of trouble in the past and it was a tough third round for me so I'm glad to go through.
Henin scored two early service breaks but Schiavone broke back each time, attacking the net in a bid to upset her opponent's rhythm and matching the Belgian's speed around the court.
But Henin showed why she is a seven-time Grand Slam champion as she found winning shots at critical points while the dogged Italian created chances but repeatedly fell just short.
She was finally defeated in one hour 41 minutes, receiving hearty applause from the Melbourne Park crowd for her wholehearted efforts to upset Henin, who won the Australian title in 2004.
Henin faces a possible quarter-final match up with Russian fifth seed Maria Sharapova but said she was did not want to get ahead of herself and was concentrating on her next tie against either Hsieh Su-Wei or Aravane Rezai.
I hate to look too far, I have my fourth round in two days and I just want to get ready, improve my game and get confident.
Low-profile fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko is looking forward to a familiar baseline duel with Russian Davis Cup teammate Mikhail Youzhny after making the fourth round of the Australian Open on Friday.
Davydenko was too strong from the back court for Frenchman Marc Gicquel, winning 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 in two hours 20 minutes.
It was his third win over French opponents at the season-opening Grand Slam after eliminating Michael Llodra and Nicolas Mahut in the opening rounds.
Davydenko, who remains at the centre of an investigation into a betting scandal following his defeat by Argentine Martin Vassallo Arguello last August, was facing the possibility of being on the end of the rocket serves of Ivo Karlovic.
Davydenko broke Gicquel's service a total of seven times, including three in the final set, and dominated the points, 103 to 81.
He was helped by the 73rd-ranked Gicquel's flow of 52 unforced errors, while the consistent Russian conceded 28.
Davydenko reached the semi-finals of the Doha tournament on his way to Australia, losing to eventual British winner Andy Murray.
Arsenal teenager Theo Walcott has been dropped from the squad for Saturday's Premier League game at Fulham and manager Arsene Wenger believes the time has come to switch him to a central striking role.
I think he is waiting to play in the centre and that is where he will be happiest because he is a direct player, he has good timing for his runs and I believe he will do well, Wenger told reporters ahead of the game at Craven Cottage.
The Arsenal manager, who famously switched Thierry Henry from the wing to a central role, explained that Walcott had been omitted from the squad for Saturday's game so he could prepare for Tuesday's League Cup semi-final at rivals Tottenham Hotspur.
He will get a chance up front but he is not in the squad for Fulham because we play again on Tuesday and some have to practise to play on Tuesday, added Wenger.
Arsenal's young League Cup team drew 1-1 in the first leg at the Emirates Stadium but are still hoping to repeat last year's triumph over Spurs at the same stage of the competition.
Walcott became the most expensive 16-year-old in the history of British football after a 12 million pounds move to Arsenal from Southampton in 2006.
The forward was then surprisingly included in Sven-Goran Eriksson's England World Cup squad and big things were anticipated of him but he has failed to live up to those expectations.
Walcott has been forced to wait patiently for his chance at Arsenal.
He did get a rare Premier League start last week but put in a disappointing performance against Birmingham City when he was picked to play on the wing.
Wenger feels the teenager is not where he expected him to be after two years at the north London club.
He will get where I expect him to be, said Wenger.
At the moment he is not.
But I'm not worried personally.
He plays on confidence and he has qualities that will come out.
I tried to force him to play wide but I'm convinced he will be a central player.
He played well in that role against Prague and he may play in very similar games in the centre, added Wenger, referring to Walcott's two-goal performance as a central striker in a 7-0 Champions League group stage win in October.
He is not happy when he doesn't play and you don't expect him to be happy when he doesn't play but I believe he is on the way to getting into the team.
The expectation level is very high because he is very young and he has been projected early into the spotlight.
I still believe he is strong enough and good enough to make it.
Valencia signed Netherlands midfielder Hedwiges Maduro from Ajax Amsterdam on Friday on a four and a half year contract.
I am delighted to have signed for a big club like Valencia, the 22-year-old told the Primera Liga team's Web site.
It has helped that Koeman is here but above all it's about the greatness of the club.
Maduro, who can also play in the centre of defence, came through the youth ranks when Koeman was in charge at Ajax.
He is seventh-placed Valencia's second signing of the January transfer window, following Argentine midfielder Ever Banega.
Spanish media reported Maduro would cost the club a fee of around two million euros.
Maduro is viewed as a replacement for dropped Spain midfielder David Albelda and Manuel Fernandes, who has joined English Premier League side Everton on loan.
Dutchman Koeman dropped stalwarts Albelda, Santiago Canizares and Miguel Angel Angulo last month after a poor run of results.
French champions Lyon will be without central defender Cleber Anderson for the rest of the season after the Brazilian suffered a serious right knee injury.
Lyon coach Alain Perrin said that Anderson was hurt in his team's midweek League Cup quarter-final defeat against Le Mans when he came off worst in a challenge with striker Tulio De Melo.
Anderson, who will undergo surgery, was recruited in August from Benfica to take over from compatriot Cris who was sidelined with ruptured ligaments.
He is expected to return to action at the end of February.
A French footballer suffered a heart attack while playing in a second division match between Sedan and Niort on Friday.
Niort defender Marco Randrianantoanina, who has played at English Premier League side Birmingham, collapsed to the ground in the 23rd minute of the match.
After being transferred to hospital in Riems, the club said the condition of Randrianantoanina had improved.
He is out of danger at the moment, said a statement on the Niort official website.
Paramedics had treated the player on the pitch at the Louis Dugauguez stadium with a defribillator after he had lost consciousness.
Randrianantoanina has also played for fellow French sides Gueugnon and Brest while, this season, he has featured in 10 second division games and four League Cup matches.
Arsenal beat Newcastle United 3-0 for the second time in four days on Tuesday to edge ahead of Manchester United in the Premier League title race.
Goals from Emmanuel Adebayor, Mathieu Flamini and Cesc Fabregas underlined Arsenal's superiority and took the Gunners three points above champions United, who can regain top spot with a win at home to Portsmouth on Wednesday.
Newcastle, beaten by the same score at the Emirates in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, are still looking for their first goal since Kevin Keegan returned as manager earlier this month and remain just seven points above the relegation zone.
The players were genuine tonight and kept chasing the ball even when they were 3-0 down, Keegan told the BBC.
3-0 looks bad but we didn't deserve to lose 3-0.
Michael Owen was wrongly flagged offside when it was only 1-0, Flamini scored a wonder goal and their third goal was definitely offside.
The three other matches on Tuesday all involved teams fighting to stay in the top flight.
Sunderland gave their survival hopes a huge boost, beating Birmingham City 2-0 at home to move out of the relegation zone and up into 14th place.
Wigan Athletic drop into the bottom three after losing 1-0 at Middlesbrough while Fulham stay second from bottom after a 0-0 draw at fellow strugglers Bolton Wanderers.
Newcastle, without a league goal this year, looked solid for 40 minutes against Arsenal but did not pose any attacking threat.
Adebayor then headed in a cross from the outstanding Flamini for his 16th league goal of the season and there was no way back for shot-shy Newcastle.
Flamini struck with a powerful right-foot shot after 72 minutes and Fabregas rounded off the victory after being put clear by Nicklas Bendtner.
The closest Newcastle came to scoring was a Nicky Butt free kick that struck the bar late on.
Midfielder Joey Barton came on as a substitute for Newcastle, his first appearance since being charged with assault and affray last month.
He was cleared to play after his bail conditions were changed.
Debutant Rade Prica scored for Sunderland to seal a crucial victory over Birmingham after Daryl Murphy opened the scoring.
That took Sunderland to 23 points, three above the bottom three.
Middlesbrough are five points clear of the drop zone after former Arsenal striker Jeremie Aliadiere got the winner against Wigan who drop into the relegation places on goal difference.
Holders AS Roma reached the Italian Cup semi-finals after Mancini's fine individual goal sealed a 1-0 win over Sampdoria on Tuesday and a 2-1 aggregate victory.

Brazilian midfielder Mancini broke forward on the hour, played a trick on the edge of the area and then fired into the near corner for his second winning goal in two games.
Visitors Sampdoria, unbeaten in five heading into the match, had some of the better chances and Hugo Campagnaro's second-half shot had to be cleared off the line by Rodrigo Taddei.
Gennaro Delvecchio also fired straight at substitute goalkeeper Doni while forwards Claudio Bellucci and Emiliano Bonazzoli went close with headers.
Former Roma striker Antonio Cassano was out for Samp with a bad back and the Genoa side missed his cutting edge up front.

The Super Eagles pipped Mali, thumped 3-0 by Ivory Coast in the other Group B game, after both finished level on four points.
Captain Didier Drogba was on target as the Ivorians, already qualified, completed a clean sweep in the group.
Off the field, the Confederation of African Football handed a dossier on attempted match-fixing to Ghanaian police.
after Benin and Namibia last week said they were approached by an unidentified man and offered money to throw games.
CAF general secretary Mustapha Fahmy said the dossier included statements from those approached and contact details given by a man purporting to represent betting interests in Singapore.
We have asked them to do a thorough investigation and have given them all the details we were able to collect, Fahmy told Reuters.
In Sekondi, Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel scored one goal and set up another as Nigeria won at last.
Obi Mikel headed in a Peter Odemwingie cross after Benin keeper Yoann Djidonou had failed to clear a Taye Taiwo free kick in the 52nd minute, their first goal of the tournament.
He then set up striker Yakubu Aiyegbeni for the second with four minutes left.
At the end of the match, members of the Nigerian technical staff lifted sheepish-looking coach Berti Vogts into the air in celebration.
Mali needed a draw in Accra but were quickly in trouble as Drogba marked his 50th cap with a 32nd international goal.
Marc Zoro, playing his first competitive match in more than six months, rose unmarked to head home from a corner in the 54th minute and Boubacar Sanogo scored his first international goal five minutes from the end.
We are extremely disappointed, said Mali coach Jean-Francois Jodar.
My team did not play at all in the first half and with a lot of attackers in the second half we still failed to find the goal.
Ivory Coast face Guinea in their quarter-final while Nigeria travel to Accra to face the hosts, who have a 100 percent record in the tournament.
Ghana coach Claude Le Roy told a news conference that he expected to be sacked if his side did not win the trophy.
If we are not champions, I'm sure a new coach will come in my place, he said.
I understand my deal and that is to win the cup.
Tuesday's goals took the tournament's tally to 63 in 20 games but South Africa goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs was not impressed, saying the ball was at fault.
It makes goalkeepers look like idiots, he said.
It isn't that the guys have been scoring good goals, it's the ball which has been making the guys look good.
AC Milan continued their climb up the Serie A table with a 1-0 win at struggling Reggina on Wednesday thanks to Alberto Gilardino's header.
The European champions endured a poor first half of the season but are now up to sixth following their fourth league win in five matches this month.
Gilardino, who partnered Brazilian teenager Pato upfront, was unmarked when he nodded in Andrea Pirlo's cross on 18 minutes to notch his seventh of the league campaign.
Milan could have scored more with Pirlo rattling the bar with a free kick and rare starter Emerson going close, while Reggina rarely threatened at the other end where Australian keeper Zeljko Kalac was preferred to Dida.
The match was postponed from December when Milan won the Club World Cup in Japan.
Carlo Ancelotti's men, seven points behind fourth-placed Fiorentina and 20 adrift of leaders Inter Milan, host Livorno in another game in hand on Feb. 13 after facing Fiorentina on Sunday and Siena the weekend after.
VfL Wolfsburg came back from the brink to knock Schalke 04 out of the German Cup with a 5-3 victory on penalties on Wednesday.

After a goalless 30 minutes Wolfsburg took the upper hand against their Bundesliga rivals when newly signed Swiss keeper Diego Benaglio saved in the shoot-out from Mladen Krstajic.
VfB Stuttgart, last season's runners-up, just managed to avoid a similar fate, as a Mario Gomez hat-trick gave them a 3-2 win over Werder Bremen Amateurs.

Hamburg SV had a more comfortable 3-0 win over third division Rot-Weiss Essen to book their place in the last eight.
Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld went out after a 2-1 loss to second division Carl Zeiss Jena.
Bayern Munich, 5-2 winners over third division Wuppertal, were one of four teams to come through on Tuesday night.

Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o scored twice to help his side beat Sudan 3-0 and reach the African Nations Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday, while his coach Otto Pfister fumed over organisation at the tournament.
Eto'o's first goal, a 27th-minute penalty, made him the highest scorer in the tournament's history with 15 goals.
A bizarre own goal put Cameroon in complete command before Eto'o struck again in injury-time to send Sudan to their third straight 3-0 defeat.
Cameroon finished second in Group C with six points, one behind defending champions Egypt who guaranteed their place despite being held 1-1 by unfancied Zambia.
Sudan's record of three defeats, no goals scored and nine conceded is the worst in Nations Cup history.
Eto'o, who overtook the 38-year-old record of Ivory Coast's Laurent Pokou, refused to comment but Pfister had plenty to say about tournament organisers.
This is a total disaster.
I don't know if this is the Nations Cup or a tournament for children, he said.
We have to put on this organising committee people who have played football.
Pfister complained that his team had been forced to travel from Kumasi to Tamale on the eve of the game and had wasted most
of Tuesday day sitting around and waiting.
We completely lost the day, said the German, whose outburst was still gathering steam when Confederation of African Football officials stopped the media conference.
Eto'o should have scored in the third minute when he had a clear chance from close-range but his first effort was saved by Mahjoub El Moez and he somehow fired the rebound over the crossbar.
Cameroon went further ahead six minutes later when Sudan midfielder Rtshard Justin Lado's attempted clearance hit Mohamed Ali Khider and rebounded into the net.
Sudan improved after halftime but Eto'o had the last say when he broke away to score his fifth goal of the tournament in injury-time.
In Kumasi, Egypt went ahead in the 15th minute when Amr Zaki scored at the end of a swift move, Sayed Moawad providing him with an easy finish for his second goal of the tournament.
Egypt missed a string of chances and were caught out when Chris Katongo blasted home from close range in the 89th minute.
At least we go home with some kind of satisfaction, displaying the talent and skill in our team.
It is a pity we are going, as we could have added more entertainment to this tournament, insisted Zambia coach Patrick Phiri.
Egypt stay in Kumasi for Monday's quarter-final against the runners-up from Group D, which features Tunisia, Angola, South Africa and Senegal.
Cameroon stay in Tamale to face the Group D winners the same day.
Cristiano Ronaldo struck both goals including a superb free kick as Manchester United beat Portsmouth 2-0 on Tuesday to cruise back to the top of the Premier League.
Chelsea maintained their title challenge with a 1-0 victory over Reading at Stamford Bridge with Michael Ballack on target while Liverpool's league season went from bad to worse with a 1-0 defeat at West Ham United.
Displaced by Arsenal 24 hours earlier, United tore into Portsmouth at Old Trafford and had the points in the bag after 13 minutes courtesy of the Portuguese who took his goal tally for the season to 27.
After 10 minutes he chested the ball to Nani and sped on to the return pass before shooting under David James.
United have 57 points, the same as Arsenal who beat Newcastle United 3-0 on Tuesday, but with a better goal difference.
Senegal and South Africa were eliminated from the African Nations Cup after a 1-1 draw in their last Group D match in Kumasi on Thursday.
Both teams needed a win to revive slim hopes of reaching the last eight but finished behind Tunisia and Angola in the standings.
Elrio van Heerden opened the scoring for South Africa inside the first quarter of an hour, finishing off a swift passing move unmarked at the back post.
Henri Camara equalised for Senegal eight minutes before halftime after a defensive slip by South Africa captain Aaron Mokoena allowed him through on goal.
Both sides created several opportunities with a running game and Senegal goalkeeper Bouna Coundoul made a series of key saves in the second half to keep South Africa at bay.
Coundoul came into the game after Senegal had suspended first choice keeper Tony Sylva and captain El Hadji Diouf because of an unauthorised night out on the town earlier in the week
Being a new team I think we go back home with some positive things, said South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira.
My young players learnt a lot about high level football and the process of learning goes on, the Brazilian said.
We are satisfied with some things but for the World Cup of course we need to improve a lot more than here.
South Africa host the 2010 event.
Senegal's new coach Lamine Ndiaye said he and his predecessors had to take responsibility for the 2002 World Cup quarter-finalists' failure to reach the second round.
Senegal reached the semi-finals of the last Nations Cup in 2006, losing to hosts and tournament winners Egypt.
Real Mallorca coach Gregorio Manzano has extended his contract with the club for two more years until June 2010, the Primera Liga side said on their Web site.

The potential is there.
Cuba are 71 in the FIFA world rankings and haven't reached the World Cup finals since 1938.
Tottenham Hotspur completed the signing of Brazil defender Gilberto from Hertha Berlin just before the close of the transfer window on Thursday.
The deal had appeared to have fallen through earlier in the day when the 31-year-old Gilberto failed a medical but Tottenham's Web site later said it had been rescued.
No transfer fee was disclosed.
The club also announced that defenders Paul Stalteri and Anthony Gardner had been allowed to join Fulham and Everton respectively on loan until the end of the season.
We are delighted to announce we have reached agreement with Hertha Berlin for the transfer of Brazilian international Gilberto, a club statement read.
The left back has spent three and a half years in Germany where he made 101 appearances in the Bundesliga for Hertha after joining from Brazilian club Sao Caetano.
He has won 27 caps for Brazil, played in the 2006 World Cup in Germany and was a member of the Brazil squads that won the 2004 and 2007 Copa America.
Gilberto is the third defender to join the Premier League club in the transfer window after Jonathan Woodgate from Middlesbrough and Alan Hutton from Rangers.
Americans Charles Warren and Kevin Sutherland got the party started at the Phoenix Open on Thursday, firing sparkling 65s to share the first-round lead in the PGA Tour's biggest bash.
After the opening round was delayed 40 minutes due to frost, Warren made a sizzling start with birdies at three of his first four holes on a cool, sunny morning.
Chasing his first PGA Tour win, Warren picked up shots at 12 and 15 before taking the outright lead with another birdie on 17.
Warren was joined atop the leaderboard by Sutherland, who carded birdies on his final two holes in fading light to complete a bogey-free round.
I knew going into the week that you've got to make a lot of birdies and you've got to give yourself a lot of chances, but there's plenty of holes out there where you can make bogey pretty easily, Warren told reporters.
Lurking one shot back on five-under 66 were Americans Brian Gay and Rich Beem, Colombian Camilo Villegas and Australian Nick O'Hern, who will return early on Friday to complete the last four holes of his round.
World number two Phil Mickelson and South Korea's K.J. Choi, the early leader of the FedEx Cup standings, overcame shaky starts to join a large group of players on three under 68.
Middlesbrough broke their transfer record to sign Brazilian striker Afonso Alves from Dutch side Heerenveen less than an hour before the end of the transfer window on Thursday.
Middlesborough did not disclose the fee on their Web site but said it was a record.
Local media reported it as being around 12 million pounds.
I'm delighted to have completed the deal, manager Gareth Southgate said.
As usual at this time of the year it was a late night but Afonso brings us something different in that he is a goalscorer who does much of his best work inside the box.
Alves, who made his international debut against England last June, scored 34 goals in 31 league games last season for Heerenveen and was voted the player of the year in the Netherlands.
This season he scored seven goals in Heerenveen's 9-0 thrashing of Heracles.
Chinese number one Li Na will face tournament debutant Alize Cornet in the opening singles rubber of the Fed Cup world group tie against a weakened France side in Beijing on Saturday.
France's Virginie Razzano, no stranger to tennis in the region after winning the Guangzhou International last September, will then face China's number two Peng Shuai in the second singles match.
Nathalie Dechy will partner Razzano against 2006 Wimbledon and Australia Open doubles champions Yan Zi and Zheng Jie on Sunday.
Two-time Fed Cup winners France are fielding a second-string team in the absence of former world number one Amelie Mauresmo and last year's Wimbledon finalist Marion Bartoli, who opted out of the tie.
While rating France as the underdogs going into the tie, team captain Georges Goven said his young team would try to exploit any pressure China might feel in front of home fans in Beijing, which will also host the Olympic Games in August.
China, in front of their own crowd, preparing for the Olympics, have a very strong image to defend, which will maybe and I hope very strongly give them a little bit of stress. 
So we can take profit from that, he told reporters. 
Real Madrid striker Raul and goalkeeper Iker Casillas have signed contract extensions that will keep them at the Primera Liga club for the rest of their playing careers.
Spain's first-choice goalkeeper Casillas, has tied himself to Real until 2017 while club captain Raul, 30, extended his deal by one year to 2011.
Both agreements will automatically roll over beyond the contracted periods if the players complete 30 official matches in the previous season.
Iker Casillas and Raul have both agreed to stay with the club for the rest of their sporting lives, Real president Ramon Calderon told a news conference on Thursday.
On this day, which is Valentine's day, Iker, Raul and Real can say they love each other, they need each other, and complement each other and will commit for life.
I am not going to speak about money but I can say they will earn less than they deserve because the example they set for the young and the enthusiasm they transmit to the fans isn't quantifiable and you cannot put a value on it.
Both players entered Real's first team from the youth ranks, Raul in 1994 and Casillas in 1999, and have become stalwarts in the side.
New Indonesian men's doubles Anggun Nugroho/Devin Lahardi failed to move on to the main round of the Germany Open that will be started on this Wednesday.

In Tuesday's other quarter-final, Borussia Dortmund eased past second division 1899 Hoffenheim 3-1.
Stuttgart looked to be heading for victory at 2-1 up in the second period of extra time but Robert Mueller took advantage of a mistake by goalkeeper Sven Ulreich in the first minute of injury time and stroked the ball into the empty net.
Antonio da Silva missed the decisive penalty, firing Stuttgart's fourth over the bar, and Torsten Ziegner then stepped up to make it 5-4 to the eastern German club and book their place in the semi-finals.
Striker Tobias Werner had given Jena a surprise lead in the 32nd minute, latching on to a long cross from the right and nodding past Ulreich.
Faced with some resolute defending, the Bundesliga champions had to wait until the 81st minute before Mario Gomez levelled.
The tall striker then netted again with a header in the fourth minute of extra time before Jena's last-gasp equaliser and the penalty drama.
In Dortmund, Giovanni Federico put the home side ahead after 20 minutes.
The Italian midfielder struck from 20 metres after good work from Tinga and the Brazilian extended Dortmund's lead three minutes later, nodding in from close range.

Inter won 4-1 at Roma in September, though.

World number 13 Golovin produced five double faults in the match and won just 49 percent of her serves.
She had beaten Mattek in straight sets in 2003 in their only other meeting.
I was seeing the ball really well, Mattek told reporters.
My goal for this match was to see the ball early, where she was hitting it.
So I was there for every shot before she knew it.
I stuck to my game plan.
I knew she was ready to go right off the bat so my goal was to get out on top and get as many points right away as I could.
Mattek will face German wildcard Julia Goerges in the second round.

The field in Dubai is so strong that world number 19 Radwanska, a quarter-finalist at the Australian Open, needed to qualify.
She's a tough opponent to play and I didn't have many wins outdoors this year, Chakvetadze told reporters.
But I was aggressive and I served pretty well and I was fighting to the end, and that's why I won.
We both played well and it was a good match to win because you get more confidence.
Seventh seed Marion Bartoli and former world number three Nadia Petrova continued their run of poor form as they both fell at the first hurdle.

Petrova's 6-4 6-4 humbling by Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik signalled her fifth first-round defeat in six tournaments this year.
Former world number one Amelie Mauresmo has also struggled this year but the Frenchwoman found her groove on Tuesday to pull off a 7-6 6-2 win over Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain.
Australian Open champion Maria Sharapova was forced to withdraw with a viral illness and blamed her condition on her recent gruelling schedule.
After having a few really long weeks I feel my body needs a rest, said the fifth seeded Russian.
McLaren's Lewis Hamilton topped the Barcelona timesheets for the second day running on Tuesday in Formula One's final pre-season test before the Australian season-opener on March 16.

We still need to find some performance in the car and some pace, said Alonso in a team statement.
But we have the potential and we just need to discover it.
There is only one day of testing left and we need to fully attack tomorrow to make the most of it.
Paris Saint Germain gained a much needed morale boost to their traumatic season here on Tuesday when they reached the League Cup final thaks to a 3-2 victory over Auxerre.
However the match featured yet another alarming mistake by PSG's France 'keeper Mickael Landreau, who punched the ball into his own net to let Auxerre back into the match at 2-1.
Landreau's error comes hot on the heels of two costly errors in the last two league matches which has seen PSG lie only three points above the relegation places.
PSG looked to have wrapped the tie up after the first-half with headers by Colombian international defender Mario Yepes and former Portuguese marksman Pauleta putting them 2-0 up.
However, Landreau's error rattled PSG's fragile nerves, which were settled once again with a shot by their longest serving player Bernard Mendy, whose 78th minute effort went through the Auxerre 'keeper's Remy Riou's legs.
Auxerre, who themselves have relegation worries being just seven points off the drop, managed to grab a consolation effort three minutes into time added on as Julien Quercia - who had only just come on as a substitute - shot home.
PSG will play either Le Mans or Lens in the final - the second semi-final takes place on Wednesday.
Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich needed a Franck Ribery penalty in the last minute of extra time to see off second-division city rivals TSV 1860 Munich 1-0 in the quarter-finals of the German Cup on Wednesday.
The French international had to take the kick twice after his team mates encroached the first time but coolly chipped the ball in at the second attempt.
The referee awarded the spot kick after Chhunly Pagenburg brought down German international striker Miroslav Klose on the very edge of the box with a penalty shootout looming.
Replays appeared to suggest contact was made just outside the area.
I think from the number of chances we had you can't really dispute that we deserved the win, Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said in a television interview.
Bayern ended the match with 10 men after their Italian international striker Luca Toni was sent off in the 84th minute and 1860 had two players sent off in extra time.
Bayern, missing injured Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, started with Ribery and Klose on the bench and chances were scant in the first half.
Midfielder Toni Kroos intercepted the ball and went clear in the 36th minute but fired his shot over the bar with Toni in a good position to his right.
Bayern thought they had a penalty in the last minute of regular time when Benjamin Schwarz appeared to drag Lucio down but the referee ignored their furious appeals.
Earlier, Marcelinho scored in extra time to give VfL Wolfsburg a 2-1 win over Hamburg SV in Wednesday's other quarter-final.
The Brazilian looked sluggish for most of the match but found an extra burst of pace in the 109th minute to power into the Hamburg area and lift the ball over advancing goalkeeper Frank Rost.
Wolfsburg had taken the lead from the penalty spot in the 17th minute.
Hamburg captain Rafael van der Vaart then levelled spectacularly in the 70th minute, lashing a long-range shot into the top corner after Mohamed Zidan's layoff. 
Wolfsburg, ninth in the Bundesliga, have never won the German Cup but reached the final in 1995, losing to Borussia Moenchengladbach.
In Tuesday's quarter-finals, second-division strugglers Carl Zeiss Jena beat Bundesliga champions VfB Stuttgart on penalties and Borussia Dortmund eased past second-division 1899 Hoffenheim 3-1.

Another Indonesian men's double, Rian Sukmawan/Yonatan Suryatama, booked a surprising victory by beating fourth seed Tadashi Ohtsuka/Keita Masuda of Japan 21-15, 21-16.
Rian/Yonathan will secure a ticket for the quarter final in a match against Russia's Vitaly Durkin/Alexandr Nikolaenko.
Men's doubles Rendra Wijaya/Fran Kurniawan also won the game against host suttlers Johannes Schoettler/Tim Dettmann 21-18, 23-25, 21-9, to meet Fang Chieh Min /Lee Sheng Mu of Taiwan in the next round.
Indonesia's mixed doubles Muhammad Rijal/Greysia Polii and Tontowi Akhmad/Yulianti maintained their positions after managing to move on to the quarter-final round.
Rijal/Greysia wil meet Robin Middleton/Liza Smith, while Tontowi/Yulianto will face first seed He Hanbin/Yu Yang of China.
Lens will face fellow relegation candidates Paris Saint Germain in the French League Cup final after they won an astonishing semi-final 5-4 over Le Mans on Wednesday.
It will be a rematch of the 1998 final which PSG won.
Lens, coached by former French striking great Jean-Pierre Papin, had to come from behind twice to take what looked like an unassailable 4-2 lead in the second-half only for Le Mans to strike twice in a minute to level it.
However, Lens, who like PSG are former French champions but in distinct danger of being relegated, grabbed the winner a minute from the end of extra-time through Malien midfielder Sidi Keita - a remarkable return after he had been taken ill during a match and sent to hospital only 10 days ago.
Papin, whose side are just a place above the relegation zone only on goal difference, breathed a huge sigh of relief.
That was a completely mad match, which you get occasionally in football, said the former Marseille and AC Milan marksman, who guided Strasbourg to the First Division last term and then replaced Guy Roux at Lens after only a few weeks of this campaign.
PSG had been the first to book their place at the March 29 final at the Stade de France when they gained a much needed morale boost to their traumatic season on Tuesday thanks to a 3-2 victory over Auxerre.
However the match featured yet another alarming mistake by PSG's France 'keeper Mickael Landreau, who punched the ball into his own net to let Auxerre back into the match at 2-1.
Landreau's error comes hot on the heels of two costly errors in the last two league matches which sees PSG lie only three points above the relegation places.
That gives us a new dimension and new hope, said PSG coach Paul Le Guen, who has adopted a low key approach and allowed club president Alain Cayzac to do most of the explaining and excuses which the latter admits he finds tiring.
A goal well into injury-time by Xavi gave Barcelona a 1-1 draw at home to Valencia in their Spanish Cup semi-final first leg clash here on Wednesday.
Valencia - whose season rests solely on winning the Cup after a disastrous Champions League and championship campaign - had taken the lead through Spanish international striker David Villa 20 minutes from time.
Barcelona too be fair had the majority of the chances - their opponents underfire coach Ronald Koeman electing to play only Villa up front - but found Valencia's German goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand in commanding form.
He was forced into his first save in the sixth minute from Xavi in the same move that had seen efforts by Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi blocked by Valencia defenders.
Barca's French duo Thierry Henry and Eric Abidal also failed to break the deadlock with their long range efforts in the first-half which Hildebrand fielded easily.
Messi, though, was the biggest offender for Barca missing twice within eight minutes in the second-half, although his worst miss was nine minutes from the end when he was one on one with Hildebrand.
Thursday's second semi-final pitches Getafe at home to Racing Santander.
The second legs are on March 19 and 20.
American boxer Evander Holyfield said in an interview published Thursday that he was in talks with Mike Tyson for a re-match of their infamous 1997 fight.
Speaking to The Guardian, Holyfield, who failed in his quest to regain a version of the world heavyweight title in October, said: There has been some talk between us.
Mike had Jeff Fenech, who's been training him, call me a few months ago.
Jeff says Mike wants to fight me again.
But he needs to know if I would agree to it.
I said, 'It all depends on what they gonna give us 
Because I'm gonna catch a lot of flak if I say I'm fighting Mike Tyson again.
I have already said I don't want to fight Mike no more'.
Jeff says, 'What if Mike gets in proper shape?' I told him that's ok but I can't be part of it if Mike's going to pull out.
Jeff said, 'The main thing Mike wants to know is if you would be willing to fight him again?' I said, 
In their 1997 fight, the second between the two boxers, Tyson, now 41, bit Holyfield, now 45, twice and ripped off a chunk of his ear, which he spat onto the canvas.
England defender Micah Richards has had an operation on his right knee, his Premier League club Manchester City said on Wednesday.
Richards, regarded as one of the most promising young players in England, had surgery to repair a damaged cartilage that had caused him problems earlier in the season.
The operation has been successful, and Micah will begin a rehabilitation programme at Carrington starting tomorrow.
The medical team will monitor his progress over the coming days and weeks, club doctor Mark Whitaker said on City's Web site.
The 19-year-old, capped 11 times for England, is expected to be out for a matter of weeks according to the club.
Cuban Olympic heavyweight boxing champion Odlanier Solis will make his first professional appearance in Italy on Friday when he takes on Hungarian Adrian Rajkai in Milan.
Solis is a rising star in heavyweight boxing having won the Olympic heavyweight title in Athens in 2004 as well as three world titles as an amateur: 2001 and 2003 as a heavyweight and 2005 as a super-heavyweight.
As a Cuban he was not allowed to turn professional but he defected from his country in December 2006, along with two other Olympic champions Yan Bartelemi Varela and Yuriorkis Gamboa Toledano, when training in Venezuela for the Pan-American Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2007.
All three eventually turned up in Miami and signed professional contracts with German-based First Artist.
Solis has won all six of his previous contests, four by knock-out, fighting in Germany and Turkey.
As an amateur he won two of his three bouts against Olympic legend and compatriot Felix Savon while he also beat WBA and WBC cruiserweight champion David Haye in the 2003 world championships final.
He beat Haye three times in four contests and also recorded a perfect two out of two victories over recently deposed WBO heavyweight champion Sultan Ibragimov in his amateur days.
Prime Minister Rudd, underscoring his support for the bid, said he would include the issue on the agenda for next month's meeting of Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments, as it would need the backing of all levels of government.
Winning the right to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup is a Herculean task, but overcoming tough odds is what Australian Football does best, the embassy release quoted Rudd as saying.
Australia has a reputation of excellence - on and off the field.
The 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, 2003 Rugby World Cup and the 2006 Commonwealth Games have shown the world that Australia is a nation that delivers the world?s best events, Rudd said.
He added that the government was keen to see Australia's bid kick off as soon as possible , given that the host country for the 2018 FIFA World Cup was likely to be announced in 2011.
FFA representatives would meet senior Australian Government officials in the next week to begin planning the bid.
The FIFA World Cup is the world's largest sporting event, The 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany attracted 3.35 million spectators, including 2 million visitors from overseas.
The event was broadcast to 214 countries and watched by a cumulative TV audience of more than 26 billion people.
Prime Minister Rudd said venues such as the MCG and Telstra Dome in Melbourne, ANZ Stadium and Sydney Football Stadium in Sydney, Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane and the recently announced new stadium for Perth could host matches.
World number one Justine Henin's 17-match winning streak at the Dubai Championships ended on Thursday when she was defeated 7-6 7-6 by unseeded Italian Francesca Schiavone in the quarter-finals.
The Belgian top seed made an unusual number of unforced errors as the feisty Italian ran her opponent all over the court and chased every ball.
She played well but I didn't take the opportunities and wasn't brave enough.
She was better than me, as simple as that, four-time Dubai champion Henin told reporters.
Henin said she felt tired after taking three hours to defeat Katarina Srebotnik on Wednesday, so the last thing she wanted was to face an opponent with the terrier-like qualities of Schiavone.
The Italian rallied superbly and executed some astonishing shots on the run.
Henin held just one break point in the first set, at 2-2, but made a forehand error.
That proved to be expensive, as she was unable to earn another opportunity and then played a dismal tiebreak, losing it 7-3.
Schiavone then broke to lead 3-2 in the second set by forcing a backhand error, and as Henin continued to struggle the Italian broke again, at love, to lead 5-2. 
Schiavone then twice failed to serve out the match, despite holding a match point at 5-4.
But Henin once more played a poor tiebreak, losing the last four points as Schiavone took it 7-4.
I had my chances to come back in the second set but I was too short.
Especially in the tiebreaks I didn't play well at all, and she came to the net and I didn't and that made a big difference.
Every short ball she was in and I didn't do the same, and that really paid off for her.
Schiavone believed she wasn't aggressive enough when leading 5-2.
Maybe she missed some balls, but personally I think I didn't give the possibility and the chance to come up and come up like she does every time.
Schiavone will next play eighth-seeded Russian Elena Dementieva, whose 5-7 6-3 6-3 win was her third victory in three meetings over third seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia.
Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova reached the semi-finals after holding off a strong second set challenge to beat France's Amelie Mauresmo 6-1 7-6.
Her next opponent will be fourth-seeded Serb Jelena Jankovic, who celebrated her 23rd birthday with the easiest of victories when sixth seed Anna Chakvetadze retired with an
injury after losing the opening set 6-1. 
Ghana-born teen Freddy Adu of Benfica leads the host United States into an eight-team North American qualifying tournament showdown for two Beijing Olympics berths starting here Tuesday.
US teammates for the 18-year-old Portuguese-based playmaker include Jonathan Spector, a defender for West Ham United; Charlie Davies, a forward for Sweden's Hammarby and Sal Zizzo, a midfielder for Germany's Hannover 96.
We've seen many strong players over the past few months, US coach Peter Nowak said.
The players that will compete in the qualifying tournament give us the best chance of going through to the Olympic Games in Beijing.
The US squad is in Group A with Panama, Honduras and political rival Cuba and will play in Tampa while Group B features Canada, Mexico, Guatemala and Haiti and will play in Los Angeles.
Two teams from each group will qualify for the March 20 semi-finals at Nashville, Tennessee, that will determine the region's two qualifiers for the Beijing Olympics.
Those teams will meet March 23 at Nashville in the final.
Panama and Honduras meet in Tuesday's opener ahead of a US-Cuba showdown.
The defending champion Mexicans will seek their 10th Olympic berth, having never finished better than fourth.
US men have made 12 Olympic appearances, the most of any nation, but have won the regional qualifying event only once and never taken an Olympic medal.
The Canadians have not reached the Olympics since a 1984 quarter-final run at Los Angeles.
The Cubans have not advanced since the 1980 Moscow Olympics while Guatemala last played in the Olympics in 1988 at Seoul.
Haiti and Panama seek their first Olympic berths while Honduras made a lone Olympic appearance in 2000.
Belgian Gert Steegmans, racing for the Quick Step team, won a sprint finish for the first stage of the Paris-Nice cycling race here on Monday.
Prologue winner Thor Hushovd of Norway holds onto the overall leader's yellow jersey after a stage which was cut in half because of rainy and windy conditions.
Instead of starting from Amilly the race was forced to get under way from the tiny village of La Chapelotte because of the adverse weather conditions, cutting the distance from 184.5km to 93km.
Sprinting up a steep finish 27-year-old Steegmans, winner of a stage of last year's Tour de France in Ghent, crossed two seconds ahead of a small group which included most of the favourites.
When we saw the wind blowing so strongly on the route the team decided to take the initiative, Steegmans said.
First of all to launch an escape and then to try to win in a sprint.
But that proved not so easy.
Philippe Gilbert, who was stronger than me, moved out front a bit too early and once I made my effort there was no one on my wheel.
Hushovd of Credit Agricole said the wind made the going tough.
When we found the wind alongside in the final 40 kilometres I stayed vigilant.
Everything went well except for the final sprint, said the Norwegian.
Steegmans set off so strongly he was impossible to follow.
France's Jerome Pineau nipped in ahead of Hushovd and Belgian Philippe Gilbert to finish second.
Australian Cadel Evans, second in the 2007 Tour de France, finished in another group two minutes behind.
Former Portuguese international Fernando Chalana will replace Jose Antonio Camacho as Benfica coach until the end of the season, club president Luis Filipe Vieira announced Monday.
Camacho resigned Sunday claiming the motivation has disappeared from handling one of Portugal's biggest clubs.
The Spaniard handed in his resignation following the 2-2 home draw with Uniao Leiria which left his team 14 points behind leaders Porto.
In principle he will hold this function until the end of the season, Vieira told a press conference.
Experience tells us that replacing coaches during the season isn't necessarily easy.
Chalana, played for Benfica between 1975 and 1990 and has been a member of their technical staff since 2002.
Camacho, a former coach of Real Madrid, took charge at Benfica after the second match of the season and signed a two-year deal with the club he had already coached from August 2003 to May 2004.
The Houston Rockets matched the NBA's third-longest victory streak when they won their 19th consecutive game by crushing the New Jersey Nets 91-73 on Monday.
Tracy McGrady sparked the milestone victory with 19 points.
Only the Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks have longer winning streaks.
The Lakers won 33 consecutive games during the 1971-72 season and the Bucks put together 20 successive wins in 1971.
The 2000 Lakers also had 19 wins in a row.
Houston will go for its 20th consecutive victory when it plays at Atlanta on Wednesday.
The Boston Celtics gained their 50th win of the season, defeating the Philadelphia 76ers 100-86 behind Kevin Garnett's 26 points and 12 rebounds.
LeBron James's 24 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds sparked the Cleveland Cavaliers to an 88-80 home win over the Portland Trail Blazers.
Hedo Turkoglu had 23 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds in the Orlando Magic's 123-112 home victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
The Dallas Mavericks used 18 points each from Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry to rout the New York Knicks 108-79.
Cuttino Mobley's two free throws with two seconds left lifted the Los Angeles Clippers to a 99-98 road win over the Miami Heat, who earlier in the day lost standout Dwyane Wade for the remainder of the season with a knee injury.
Belgian Gert Steegmans continued his winning form on Tuesday claiming the second stage of the Paris-Nice cycling race ahead of race leader Thor Hushovd of Norway.
It is the second consecutive stage win for Quick Step rider Steegmans who won a sprint finish ahead of Credit Agricole's Hushovd, France's Sylvain Chavanel and Swiss Michael Albasini.
The aim was to win one stage.
When my legs were good I always made mistakes.
Steegmans added: We decided to control the race with Hushovd's team.
We accelerated before the final climb because otherwise it would have been difficult to join the breakaway.
The first peloton, controlled by Belgian Philippe Gilbert, crossed the line several metres behind, after the 201km run under the rain from Nevers to the Beaujolais region.
France's Thierry Hupond from the Dutch Skil team, emerged as potential hope as the 23-year-old lead a long breakaway from the 30km mark, building up a lead of 15 minutes by 105km before being joined just before the summit of the final climb 19 km from the line.
Luxembourg's Frank Schleck, one of the race favourties, lost three minutes after being caught up in pileup, one of two crashes to disrupt the peloton, some 60km from Belleville.
Hushovd has a three-second advantage on Steegmans in the overall standings going into the third stage, over 165 km from Fleurie to Saint-Etienne.
I'm happy to hold the yellow jersey but I'm disappointed to have missed the chance.
I'd a real chance to win the stage, said Hushovd.
Lille moved closer to safety with a 2-1 win at fellow-strugglers Racing Lens in Ligue 1 on Tuesday.
Lille, who jump four spots to 11th in the 20-strong table, scored a goal in each half through defenders Michel Bastos and Franck Beria to pick up the points from a game postponed from last December because of a frozen pitch.
Lens, who reduced the arrears with a late goal from Brazilian defender Hilton, stay fifth from bottom, two points from the relegation zone.
Bundesliga champions VfB Stuttgart won 1-0 at bottom club Energie Cottbus on Tuesday night to revive their hopes of playing in Europe next season.
Fernando Meira headed the lone goal off a corner kick in the 30th minute after team-mate Roberto Hilbert was denied by the left post earlier in the game.
Stuttgart rank sixth in the league with 37 points after a fourth straight win, just one point behind fifth place which grants a UEFA Cup berth and is currently occupied by Schalke 04.
Bayern Munich lead the way with 50 points.
Tuesday's game was originally set for March 1, but cancelled due to stormy weather.
World number six Andy Roddick has decided to miss this year's Olympic Games in Beijing to defend his Washington Open title.
Both events take place from Aug. 11-17 and Roddick wants to remain in his home country to help his build-up for the U.S. Open which begins two weeks later.
My goal every summer is to win the U.S. Open, the 25-year-old American said in a statement released on Tuesday by Washington Open organisers.
I have won the Legg Mason Tennis Classic three times and feel defending my title in Washington best prepares me for another grand slam title.
Roddick, who won his only grand slam title at the 2003 U.S. Open, triumphed in Washington in 2001, 2005 and last year.
He clinched the 2007 crown by beating fellow American John Isner 6-4 7-6 in the final.
Argentina have left out midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme and forward Carlos Tevez from their squad for this month's friendly away to African champions Egypt.
Coach Alfio Basile called up uncapped Girondins Bordeaux striker Fernando Cavenaghi for the match in Cairo on March 26 while Porto's Lisandro Lopez was also given the chance for a rare outing.
Basile said he would be interested to see how the team, which usually revolves around Riquelme, would perform without the mercurial playmaker.
When Riquelme doesn't play in my team, the whole system changes, Basile told a news conference.
He's a player who controls the whole team and it's difficult to find someone else who can do the same thing.
But it's good to test other ways of playing.
Tevez was sent off in the 2-1 World Cup qualifying defeat to Colombia in November and will miss their next competitive game, another qualifier against Ecuador in June.
Basile warned that Egypt, who will be playing their first match since winning the African Nations Cup for the second time running last month, would be tough opponents.
It's very difficult to win two successive tournaments in Africa with all those great players.
They're a very strong team and they beat all the star players.
Argentina will also be without forward Lionel Messi, who is expected to be out for six weeks with a thigh injury he suffered during last week's Champions League match for Barcelona against Celtic.
PSV Eindhoven relinquished Juande Ramos's hold on the UEFA Cup after the Dutch league leaders knocked out his Tottenham Hotspur side in a penalty shootout to reach the quarter-finals on Wednesday.
The Spanish coach had guided Sevilla to back-to-back triumphs in 2006 and 2007 but Spurs bowed out after Pascal Chimbonda fired his spot-kick wide to hand PSV a 6-5 win in the shootout.
Spurs, with a Dimitar Berbatov goal, had won 1-0 after extra time at the Philips stadium to finish 1-1 on aggregate.
Premier League rivals Everton also lost on penalties to Fiorentina while competition favourites Bayern Munich eased through 6-2 on aggregate against Anderlecht, despite suffering a first home defeat of the season in any competition after the Belgians restored some pride with a 2-1 victory.
Bayer Leverkusen, Zenit St Petersburg and Getafe also advanced to the last eight.
Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld handed a number of fringe players a start against Anderlecht having routed the Belgians 5-0 in the first leg.
Defender Lucio extended Bayern's advantage with an early goal but to their credit, Anderlecht battled back to win the game with strikes from Serhat Akin and Oleksandr Yakovenko.
Former winners Bayer Leverkusen dumped out Bundesliga rivals Hamburg SV in a thrilling second-leg tie, which they lost 3-2 but went through on away goals.
Separated by just one place and one point in the Bundesliga, fourth-placed Leverkusen struck first against third-placed Hamburg with a 19th-minute goal from Sergej Barbarez.
The Bosnian forward, who spent six years with Hamburg before joining Leverkusen in 2006, redirected a free kick from Tranquillo Barnetta past Frank Rost to leave the home side up against it.
Substitute Piotr Trochowski gave them hope with a 53rd-minute equaliser but Greek striker Fanis Gekas, the first-leg matchwinner, replied immediately.
Peruvian international Paolo Guerrero equalised with 25 minutes remaining and in a late rally Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart struck with nine minutes left, but Hamburg could not get another and bowed out.
We're fortunate to go through. 
We were lucky they didn't get a third goal.
I'm not very happy about our defence.
But I'm happy we're through, said Leverkusen coach Michael Skibbe.
Zenit eliminated Marseille in the last 16 for the second time in three seasons thanks to Pavel Pogrebnyak's double in a 2-0 victory at the Petrovsky stadium with the Russian champions prevailing on away goals.
Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini will not leave the Serie A side at the end of the season as he had announced, club president Massimo Moratti told the Italian press Wednesday.
Mancini made his announcement following the Italian champions' elimination from the Champions League on Tuesday night as Liverpool completed a 3-0 aggregate victory at the San Siro.
But Moratti said that Mancini had a change of heart.
I've had a talk with Mancini, who confirmed to me that he wanted to stay at Inter even next year and to see out his contract and he wants to win the Champions League next season, Moratti told La Gazzetta dello Sport website.
The former Sampdoria and Lazio player has guided Inter to the last two Scudetto titles and his team currently lead the Serie A table by six points.
When asked about the news on Tuesday, Moratti replied no comment but he broke his silence a day later.
Mancini's words surprised me.
I didn't expect it and even less so I believe the people close to him, he said.
Mancini stunned the football world by adding at the end of his post-match press conference that he had decided to leave the club and had already informed his players of his decision.
I think for me the next two and a half months will be me my last on the Inter bench, he said at the time.
After four years and even if I have another four years on my contract, at the end of the season I'll leave Inter.
I've already told the players.
Tonight's defeat had nothing to do with my decision.
His players also seemed stunned but many felt it was a knee-jerk reaction to another season of disappointment in the Champions League.
It surprised me a bit but I think we say many things in the heat of the moment, said Argentine striker Julio Cruz.
Valencia stunned Barcelona 3-2 at the Mestalla to reach the King's Cup final 4-3 on aggregate on Thursday.
Barca, who had scrambled an injury-time equaliser to draw 1-1 in the first leg, were hit by a Ruben Baraja piledriver and a breakaway goal from Juan Mata before halftime in an intense encounter they dominated throughout.
Substitute Thierry Henry pulled one back for Barca in the second half only for Mata to bag his second almost immediately and, although a late Samuel Eto'o goal set up a grandstand finish, it was to no avail.
The victory relieves some of the pressure on coach Ronald Koeman who has seen Valencia drop out of Europe and the league title race since he replaced Quique Sanchez Flores in November.
It's ridiculous to say your fortunes change because of one game.
But all teams need a little breathing space and hopefully this victory give us that, said Koeman.
It's a great night for Valencia who have suffered a lot recently.
Valencia will meet Getafe on April 16, with a place in next season's UEFA Cup up for grabs, after Michael Laudrup's side booked a second consecutive appearance in the final with a 4-2 aggregate victory over Racing Santander on Wednesday.
Third seed Jelena Jankovic reached the last four at the Pacific Life Open when American Lindsay Davenport retired from their quarter-final because of a back injury on Thursday.
The 31-year-old Davenport, twice former champion at Indian Wells, summoned her trainer when trailing Serb Jankovic 4-1 before deciding to withdraw after losing the first set 6-2.
I've gone down this road before and you never know, maybe it'll loosen up, Davenport told reporters.
My back was injured before I came here but it got better and got better.
Then I woke up this morning and I just couldn't move.
It was pretty obvious to me after two games that it was pretty sore out there and pretty hard to rotate.
Jankovic will face compatriot Ana Ivanovic in the semi-finals after the top seed brushed aside Russia's Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-4 earlier in the day.
The 20-year-old Ivanovic, bidding for her first WTA title of the year, outplayed her opponent in a baseline battle to seal victory in just over an hour at Indian Wells Tennis Garden.
I started really well, Ivanovic told reporters after reaching her third semi-final of the season.
I thought I played some of my best tennis here so I was really happy about that.
In the second set, I had a break up and then lost a little bit of concentration.
I started to get a bit emotional and tried to go for too much.
I was just happy that at the end of the second set, I managed to keep calm and play good, added the Serb, who hit 18 winners in the match to Zvonareva's 10.
World number two Ivanovic, who lost to Russian Maria Sharapova in the Australian Open final in January, broke Zvonareva in the second and fourth games to breeze through the opening set in 24 minutes.
Service breaks were exchanged early in the second set before the pony-tailed Serb again broke in the ninth game when Zvonareva hit a forehand wide.
Eintracht Frankfurt came from behind to snatch a controversial 2-1 home win over lowly Energie Cottbus in the Bundesliga on Thursday.
Cottbus, who beat leaders Bayern Munich last weekend, took a 48th minute lead when Eintracht keeper Oka Nikolov allowed a seemingly harmless 25-metre shot from Timo Rost to slip through his hands.
Brazilian Caio levelled from 18 metres out after a neat one-two with Czech striker Martin Fenin, but there was controversy in the 65th minute over whether the ball had crossed
the line when defender Marco Russ struck the winner.
Cottbus keeper Gerhard Tremmel dived to his right to parry Russ's shot and the ball hit the post before bouncing back down the goal line before being smothered by Tremmel.
Referee Michael Kemptner showed no hesitation in awarding the goal but television replays appeared to show that only part of the ball had crossed the line.
Frankfurt moved up to sixth place with the win, while 15th-placed Cottbus are just above the drop zone.
Rapid Bucharest coach Mircea Rednic resigned on Thursday after their derby against Steaua was abandoned when the home side's fans threw objects, mainly stones and cigarette lighters, onto the pitch.
Referee Alexandru Deaconu ended the match in the 73rd minute, a minute after a stone struck him on the head, with Rapid leading 1-0 after a goal scored by defender Cristian Sapunaru six minutes earlier.
Rednic said he resigned over the general lack of fair play in Romanian football, endless refereeing scandals and Rapid fans' permanent verbal aggression against him.
I quit because I was defeated by Romanian football, Rednic told reporters.
Today I realised that you can achieve nothing good here.
The visiting Steaua players had to wait in their changing room for more than an hour before they could leave the ground.
According the Romanian Soccer Federation rules, Rapid could be penalised with a 3-0 defeat, a 10-point deduction and have their stadium suspended.
We'll apply the rules, FRF president Mircea Sandu told reporters without elaborating.
Rapid officials strongly criticised the referee's decision and club vice-president Constantin Zotta said the fans who caused the trouble were Steaua supporters in among the home crowd.
Several Steaua fans deliberately provoked the trouble, Zotta told reporters.
Steaua are second in the standings with 47 points from 23 matches and Rapid third with 45.
Leaders CFR Cluj have 56 points from 24 games after beating Farul Constanta 2-1 on Wednesday.
Olympique Lyon moved a step closer to a seventh successive Ligue 1 title with a 4-2 home win over Paris St Germain on Sunday that sent the leaders nine points clear.
The down side to a precious win was that Lyon striker Karim Benzema was substituted in the first half with an ankle injury that makes him a doubftul starter for France's friendly international against England in Paris on Wednesday.
Lyon were 2-0 up after 36 minutes courtesy of two goals by Brazilian forward Fred but strugglers PSG fought back with a goal from defender Zoumana Camara just before halftime and a penalty by midfielder Jerome Rothen on 52 minutes.
France forward Sidney Govou collected a fine pass from midfielder Mathieu Bodmer to race into the box and put Lyon back in front on 65 minutes.
Brazil midfielder Juninho, the Lyon captain, sealed his side's win with a volley from inside the box seven minutes later.
Lyon move on 64 points from 30 games, nine more than second-placed Girondins Bordeaux, who lost 3-1 at Valenciennes on Saturday and face a struggle to catch up the leaders with just eight matches left.
PSG, who have been in the top division since 1974, are third from bottom.
Werder Bremen were held to a 1-1 draw at relegation-threatened Arminia Bielefeld on Sunday in a further blow to their championship ambitions.
Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich widened their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday with their 2-1 win over third-placed Bayer Leverkusen, while second-placed Hamburg SV were held to a 1-1 draw at VfL Wolfsburg.
Werder, with just four points from their last five league matches, are fourth on 44 points.
Schalke 04, who beat Hertha Berlin 2-1 on Sunday, are fifth.
Werder had been in the top three and on course for the Champions League until their recent slump.
Brazil playmaker Diego celebrated his first match back after a three-match suspension by converting a penalty in the 70th minute for Werder, his 11th goal of the season after Bielefeld defender Oliver Kirch put the hosts in front in the 14th minute.
In Berlin, Gerard Asamoah and Jermaine Jones scored early to put Schalke 2-0 in front. 
Sofian Chahed converted a penalty in the 67th.
The defeat ended Hertha's six-match unbeaten streak.
Serb Ana Ivanovic clinched her first WTA title of the year by hammering Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-4 6-3 in the Pacific Life Open final on Sunday.
The 20-year-old top seed from Belgrade broke Kuznetsova, the second seed, three times in the second set to wrap up victory in one hour 21 minutes at Indian Wells Tennis Garden.
After dominating a first set of quality shot-making with sparkling forehands, Ivanovic held the edge in an error-prone second before sealing the title by hitting a service return winner.
It was the sixth WTA success of Ivanovic's career and Kuznetsova's third loss in a final this season.
It's a great victory for me, a beaming Ivanovic told reporters, having squealed in delight after securing the first Masters Series title of the year and beating the Russian for a fifth time in six meetings.
When I managed to break her at four-all in the first set, it gave me confidence and I went strong from that point on.
I was most happy about my aggressiveness today, added the Serb, who hit 30 winners to Kuznetsova's 14.
I was staying low and taking my opportunities, knowing that when she would hit the short ball.
I would try to attack and take away time from her.
I'm really enjoying my time and I'm playing some good tennis.
The hard work is paying off so I'm just happy to see that.
Kuznetsova, the 2004 U.S. Open champion, conceded she had been totally outplayed in losing her eighth WTA final in her last nine.
It's always painful to lose, but I prefer to get to the final losing than to lose in second round, the Russian said.
I think she played incredibly well in the first set, every important ball she hit a winner on the line.
On a sun-drenched afternoon in the California desert, the opening set went with serve until the ninth game when a crunching forehand by Ivanovic forced an error off Kuznetsova's backhand for the Serb to lead 30-40.
Ivanovic, Australian Open runner-up in January, coolly clinched the break point with a whipping top-spin forehand winner to edge ahead 5-4.
The elegant Serb then served out to take the opening set in 40 minutes, clinching the final point when the Russian hit a forehand long.
Ivanovic took early control in the second set, breaking in the third game when Kuznetsova pushed a backhand wide to lead 2-1.
World number three Novak Djokovic held off a fightback by American Mardy Fish to win the Pacific Life Open final 6-2 5-7 6-3 on Sunday and secure his second prestigious ATP title of the year.
Two months after claiming his first grand slam crown at the Australian Open, the third-seeded Serb broke world number 98 Fish once in the final set before sealing victory in just over two hours.
There is something in this desert air which keeps me going year after year, Djokovic, runner-up at Indian Wells 12 months ago, said in a courtside interview.
Fish, ranked a career-high 17th four years ago, capped a remarkable week that featured three victories over top-10 players by stunning Swiss world number one Roger Federer in Saturday's semi-finals.
This has been a tremendous week for me, definitely one I will never forget, said Fish, who won the last of his two ATP titles in Houston in 2006.
Yesterday was one of the best days of my life and this is my favourite tournament.
Djokovic made a fast start in the final, winning the first six points of the match and breaking Fish in the second game when the American crowd favourite hit a forehand long.
Although Fish broke back in the fifth, forcing a backhand error by his opponent with a searing forehand service return, he failed to hold serve in the sixth.
A protracted game featuring high-quality rallies ended when Fish pushed a backhand wide and double-faulted to trail 2-4.
The 20-year-old Djokovic held for 5-2 and again broke in the eighth when the American double-faulted to take the opening set in 35 minutes.
The second set went with serve until breaks were exchanged in the sixth and seventh games, the Serb throwing his racket in frustration after double-faulting for his lead to be pegged back to 4-3.
Fish, beginning to replicate the form he produced the previous day to stun Federer, piled on the pressure in the 11th before breaking when Djokovic netted a backhand.
That put the American 6-5 up and he served out for the set, levelling the match when the Serb blasted a backhand drive into the net.
Djokovic fought back from 0-40 down on his own serve in the first game of the third to hold and broke Fish in the second with a backhand winner down the line.
The rest of the set went with serve until the Serb fired his 10th ace of the afternoon for his first match point before sealing victory at the second attempt when Fish struck a backhand long.
American Greg Kraft won his first PGA Tour title at the Puerto Rico Open on Sunday when he won by one shot from compatriots Jerry Kelly and Bo Van Pelt.
The 43-year-old finished on a 14-under-par total of 274 after a final round 70 at the Trump International course that featured three birdies and a solitary bogey at the 18th.
Van Pelt had led after each of the previous rounds but could only manage an even-par 72 on the final day despite an eagle on the fifth.
The 32-year-old bogeyed the eighth and ninth and then on the back nine he cancelled out his two birdies with a pair of bogeys.
In contrast, Kraft produced a solid and consistent round with three birdies and despite his last-hole slip he was safely home for victory.
Kelly matched Kraft's 70 to finish in a tie for second as Kevin Stadler and Briny Baird finished a further shot back to share fourth .
For Kraft, who has come back from serious illness to rebuild his career, it was a hugely satisfying win.
You never knew if it was going to come.
I mean, I worked and worked and worked.
In the late '90s, early 2000, I was close a lot, he said.
Then I got sick, and to be honest with you, I didn't know if I was ever going to play again even less win a tournament.
But here I am, I knocked it out, four solid days.
I didn't, you know, make too many mistakes.
It was a day of patience, he said.
Barcelona closed to within four points of Real Madrid at the top of the Primera Liga on Sunday after the leaders lost 3-2 at home to Valencia while the Catalans beat Valladolid 4-1 at the Nou Camp.
Real slipped to only their second home defeat of the season when former Atletico Madrid forward Angel Arizmendi struck a dramatic 89th-minute winner in a frenetic encounter which featured two goals apiece from Raul and David Villa.
Bernd Schuster's side, who have lost five of their last eight games, lead the table on 62 points, Barca follow on 58, while Villarreal, 2-1 winners at basement side Levante, are in third spot on 56.
There are lots of ways to lose a game and this was a huge disappointment, Schuster told reporters after the game.
We are suffering too many defeats and are paying a heavy price for the few errors we are making.
Atletico Madrid tightened their grip on the final Champions League berth with a 2-1 win at Sevilla on Saturday, their first win at the Sanchez Pizjuan in over 15 years.
Valencia were first to strike at the Bernabeu, Villa sweeping the ball past Iker Casillas 11 minutes from the break after he had beaten the offside trap to latch on to a clever through ball from David Silva.
But their celebrations were cut short when Raul equalised just over a minute later, heading in from six metres out after he got the better of former club colleague Ivan Helguera who had came on as a substitute moments earlier.
The Real skipper took his tally for the season to 15 when he struck again early in the second half, squeezing a shot inside the post after Guti had threaded the ball through the Valencia defence.
But Valencia, who reached the final of the King's Cup after a 4-3 win over Barcelona in midweek, caused plenty of problems for the Real defence with their fast-breaking attacks and Fabio Cannavaro gave away a penalty when he pushed Silva in the back.
Villa sent Casillas the wrong way with his spot kick to make it 2-2 with his second.
Real peppered the Valencia goal with shots in a frantic final quarter.
But German keeper Timo Hildebrand pulled off a succession of brilliant reflex saves to deny the home side and Arizmendi complete a great week for Ronald Koeman's side when he rounded Cannavaro and beat Casillas at the near post with a pin-point shot.
Barcelona claimed their first win in four outings thanks to an outstanding display from Spain under-21 forward Krkic.
The Catalans had headed into the match under heavy pressure after taking just one point from their previous three league games and losing to Valencia in the Cup.
They looked edgy after Valladolid midfielder Jonathan Sesma had cancelled out a Samuel Eto'o goal with a penalty on the half hour, but Andres Iniesta settled their nerves when he restored their lead at the start of the second half.
Krkic made it 3-1, clipping in from a tight angle just after the hour and then capped an outstanding display when he poked home from a metre out after Eto'o had swerved round the keeper and slid a pass across the face of the goal.
Relegation-threatened Real Murcia claimed their first win since Javier Clemente took charge as coach at the start of the month with an emphatic 4-0 win at home to Espanyol.
Juventus striker David Trezeguet has replaced injured Karim Benzema in France's squad to face England in a friendly international on Wednesday in Paris, the French Football Federation said on Sunday. Benzema sustained an ankle injury in his Olympique Lyon
Trezeguet has not played for France since a 1-0 defeat by Scotland in February last year in Paris.
Chelsea kept alive their hopes of winning the Premier League title at the same time as severely denting Arsenal's when late goals from Didier Drogba gave them a 2-1 come-from-behind win at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
Drogba scored with an unstoppable drive after 73 minutes and powerfully hooked home nine minutes later to give Chelsea victory.
After Bacary Sagna had put Arsenal ahead in the 59th minute with a near-post header from a Cesc Fabregas corner.
The London derby victory lifted Chelsea into second place above Arsenal on 68 points from 31 matches.
Arsenal, now without a win in five league games after four draws and this defeat only their second in the league all season slipped to third on 67 points.
After leading the table at the start of the month, their hopes of their first title since 2004 are fading fast with only seven matches to play.
Champions Manchester United maintained their lead at the top when they beat Liverpool 3-0 at Old Trafford earlier on Sunday to move to 73 points.
The loss left Liverpool on 59 points and out of contention.
The Chelsea fans, who last saw their team lose at home in the league 78 matches ago when Arsenal won at Stamford Bridge in February 2004, were fearing the worst as the match moved into its closing stages with Arsenal leading by Sagna's first goal for the club.
Both teams had played some superb football throughout the game, but Arsenal had just shaded the midfield with Alexandr Hleb having an outstanding game and Robin van Persie a continual threat in only his second start after a long injury lay-off.
And with almost an hour played, Arsenal took the lead they just about deserved,Sagna escaped his markers to head Fabregas's corner inside Carlo Cudicini's near post.
Chelsea though, who lost the lead three times in Wednesday's remarkable 4-4 draw against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, this time found the strength to pull themselves back into the game and they equalised with 17 minutes to go.
Arsenal failed to clear a long ball from John Terry which ran loose to Drogba who thundered the ball past the previously unbeatable Manuel Almunia for the equaliser.
Some wayward defending cost Arsenal the game soon after when Kolo Toure failed to cut out Joe Cole's cross and Drogba pounced to score.
The Chelsea fans, who had jeered Avram Grant's double substutiton after 70 minutes when he replaced Claude Makelele and Michael Ballack with Juliano Belleti and Nicolas Anelka, were screaming in delight at the end. 
Chelsea are now back with a fighting chance of securing the title for the third time in four seasons and Manchester United's visit to Stamford Bridge on April 26 is likely to be another pivotal battle.
Factbox on Hugo Sanchez, who was sacked as Mexico soccer coach on Monday.
Born July 11, 1958 in Mexico City and widely regarded as the finest footballer Mexico has ever produced.
Leading scorer in the Spanish championship five times, once with Atletico Madrid and four times with Real Madrid.
Sanchez won 75 caps, scoring 47 goals for Mexico, though like the team he underperformed at major tournaments.
He played at the 1978, 1986 and 1994 World Cups, scoring only one goal.
Sanchez began his playing career with Mexico City's Pumas UNAM and finished with Atletico Celaya in 1996.
He also played for clubs in the United States and Austria.
As a coach, he had two stints with the Pumas beginning in 2000 and ending in 2006, winning successive Mexican titles in 2004.
Had a brief spell with Necaxa in 2006.
Sanchez was sent off more than a dozen times during his stints with the Pumas for arguing with the referee and believed the officials were persecuting him.
Sanchez was an outspoken critic of previous Mexico coach Ricardo La Volpe.
He criticised the policy of selecting foreign-born players and of playing friendly internationals in the United States instead of Mexico.
Sanchez was named Mexico soccer coach on Nov. 16, 2006 and was expected to lead the team to qualification for the 2010 World Cup.
In their first official competition under his leadership, Mexico reached the 2007 Gold Cup final where they lost 2-1 to the United States.
Sanchez's high point came less than one week later when his side beat Brazil 2-0 in the Copa America.
They went on to finish third.
In March, Mexico's under-23 team, which Sanchez also coached, failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics, regarded as a major failure.
He was sacked two weeks later.
Mexico fired coach Hugo Sanchez on Monday after only 16 months in the job, the Mexico Football Federation said.
The former Real Madrid striker, widely regarded as the finest player Mexico has produced, was sacked two weeks after the under-23 team, which he also coaches, failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.
The FMF said the decision had been taken by a meeting of the federation's executive committee, which is made up of the presidents of the 18 first division clubs.
Sanchez, appointed in November 2006 after lobbying intensively for the job for years, was in charge for 23 full internationals, winning 12, drawing three and losing eight.
However, it was the Olympic team's failure which proved his downfall as Mexico were knocked out in the first stage of the CONCACAF qualifying tournament after finishing third behind Canada and Guatemala in their group.
The full international side were also criticised for their performance at the CONCACAF Gold Cup last year.
Despite reaching the final, where they lost 2-1 to hosts United States, Mexico struggled to one-goal wins over Cuba, Panama and Guadeloupe and were beaten by Honduras.
They produced a much-improved performance at the Copa America in Venezuela shortly afterwards, beating Brazil 2-0 and thumping Paraguay 6-0 on their way to the semi-finals where they lost to a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina.
World number six Andy Roddick is planning to marry 20-year-old model Brooklyn Decker.
The couple wanted to tell their family and close friends first but good news travels fast, said a note on American Roddick's official Web site.
With their hectic travel schedules, Andy and Brooklyn plan to enjoy their engagement and will wait to set a wedding date.
Decker has appeared as a swimsuit model in Sports Illustrated magazine.
Sixth seed Roddick continues his Sony Ericsson Open campaign with a third-round match against Czech qualifier Ivo Minar in Miami later on Monday.
Empoli have reappointed Luigi Cagni as coach after sacking Alberto Malesani, Serie A's bottom club said on Monday.
Fellow strugglers Catania also announced the departure of coach Silvio Baldini in a statement.
Baldini had been in charge since the start of the season and Italian media said he was expected to be replaced by former Italy goalkeeper Walter Zenga.
Catania are hovering over the drop zone after a 2-1 home defeat by Torino on Sunday.
Tuscan side Empoli are one point adrift at the bottom with seven games left of the season following Sunday's 2-0 home loss to Sampdoria.
The change of coach was announced on their Web site.
Cagni returns after being sacked and replaced by former Udinese boss Malesani in November, when Empoli were third from bottom.
The dismissal of Cagni was a surprise after he had led the small club to seventh spot in the previous season and a first ever appearance in the UEFA Cup.
Sacking coaches and then bringing them back is in vogue in Italy.
Palermo's Stefano Colantuono, dismissed in November, returned for a second spell last week but lost his first game 1-0 at Napoli on Sunday.
There will be a formidable police presence at the Champions League quarter-final, first leg match between AS Roma and Manchester United in Rome on Tuesday with 1,400 officers on duty.
Trouble has flared between the two sets of fans during the last two encounters between the teams in the city, in April and December of last year.
Several United fans were stabbed by Roma ultras and the English club's supporters were also baton-charged by police both inside and outside the stadium.
They were in turn accused of trying to get into the ground with forged tickets, which further exacerbated problems between English fans and law enforcement officers.
Greater Manchester police have urged United's fans to use the official free buses laid on to take them to the stadium rather than making their own way there.
Georgia's German coach Klaus Toppmoeller has been sacked by the country's soccer federation because of the team's disappointing results, Interfax news agency reported.
The removal of the head coach from his job was dictated by the extremely mediocre performances of the national side under his management, the news agency quoted soccer federation president Nodar Akhalkatsi as telling reporters.
Toppmoeller, a former Bayer Leverkusen coach who in his first season at the German club took them to the Champions League final, had been Georgian head coach since 2006.
Georgia failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals, despite inflicting a shock 2-0 defeat on Scotland last year and holding Ukraine to a 1-1 draw in their group campaign.
German powerhouses Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen will look to record comfortable first leg leads in their UEFA Cup quarter-finals on Thursday and all but set up a tantalising semi-final between themselves.
Bundesliga leaders Bayern host Spanish side Getafe while Bayer are at home to Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg.
The other two ties see Britain's sole remaining representative Rangers at home to Portuguese outfit Sporting Lisbon while Fiorentina receive Dutch side PSV Eindhoven.
Bayern last won this trophy in the 1995/96 season and it is one that has eluded the grasp of their master coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who would love to round off his time in charge - he is leaving to take over the Swiss national side at the end of this campaign - by landing it.
Getafe, though, might only be 12th in their championship but have punched above their weight this term in the UEFA Cup, eliminating Portuguese giants Benfica in the last round.
However, they travel to Germany with a bad omen hovering over them as coach Michael Laudrup has never won there even during his stellar playing career and the former Danish playmaker is far from confident that record is going to end.
We are talking about the best team in the tournament and the best players, he told UEFA.com.
Laudrup will be praying that Bayern are still a little leg weary after their tired performance last Saturday saw them held 1-1 by strugglers Nuremberg, which Hitzfeld claimed was just a bad day at the office but added he would be holding frank discussions with the players.
Indeed Bayern's rugged Argentinian international defender Martin Demichelis is convinced that Bayern will face a tough battle with their opponents.
I rate Getafe as one of the best teams still in the competition, he told the club's website.
They will be totally motivated and are not coming here for a kickabout.
They are as keen to make the semi-finals, added Demichelis, who has had a bet with compatriot and Getafe goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri over the outcome.
Bayer, winners of this tournament in 1988, can only really think of the UEFA Cup as the sole chance of silverware this term as they are 10 points behind Bayern in the title race, having failed to take advantage of Bayern's draw last weekend by losing 2-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt.
However, they face tough opposition in Zenit, coached by two-time former Dutch national handler Dick Advocaat, and Bayer's Swiss midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta admitted they would have to up their game to take a lead to Russia.
Bayer coach Michael Skibbe confessed that he would have preferred to have played the first leg in Russia, especially as Zenit showed what a force they are in their lair by overturning a 3-1 deficit from the first leg in Marseille by beating the French side 2-0 in St Petersburg to win on the away goal rule.
They will have to be especially wary of Zenit frontman Pavel Pogrebnyak, who has scored four times in the last four UEFA Cup matches to take his total to seven for the competition this term.
Rangers will be looking to add the UEFA Cup to their sole European title win, the now defunct Cup Winners Cup in 1972, by establishing a comfortable advantage to take to Lisbon next week against a side they beat on their way to the Cup Winners Cup.
Sporting, however, are determined to gain consolation for the fact they have failed to mount a strong challenge for the title with FC Porto, and trail them by 20 points with just six matches remaining.
Rangers should welcome back tough-tackling midfielder Brahim Hemdani, who has had more of an impact on their European challenge this term than on the domestic title race, and he will have to be at his sharpest to deny Sporting's Brazilian sharpshooter Liedson, who scored twice at the weekend in league action.
Fiorentina will also be hoping to make home advantage count against PSV, who are five points ahead of Ajax in the title race with three matches remaining, but face a formidable obstacle in the Dutch side's 'keeper Gomes, who once again proved his credentials in the 0-0 draw with NEC Breda last weekend.
He is a great goalkeeper, someone who does that little bit special, said PSV coach Sef Vergoossen.
Fenerbahce midfielder Deivid went from zero to hero as his side came from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1 in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg.
Deivid had looked like the villain of the peace when he gifted Chelsea the lead with an early own goal at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium.
But the Turkish champions snatched an equaliser through Colin Kazim-Kazim midway through the second half and Deivid made amends for his earlier blunder with a breath-taking winner nine minutes from full-time.
How Chelsea left Istanbul empty-handed only they will know.
They were in complete control and should have been further in front before Kazim-Kazim struck.
Avram Grant's side will still believe they can overturn the deficit in the return at Stamford Bridge next week but the task is far harder than it should have been.
Grant told Sky TV afterwards: This is football.
A game supposed to be 3-0 or 4-0 for us ends 2-1 against us.
We dominated the game, we created chances.
At 1-1 Michael Ballack was in front of the goal.
But this is football.
Sometimes you don't pay attention, you sleep and we lost the game.
Normally, it's a good result to lose 2-1 away from home but because we played the better football it's disappointing.
Now they are coming to our home, we need to win the game.
His Fenerbahce counterpart Zico said that they had turned things round at half-time.
At the break we told the players that we had to take risks, that without taking them we would end up with nothing, said the former Brazil playing legend.
If we show the same attitude in England then I believe that we will get the result that sends us through to the semi-finals.
Fenerbahce had never been this far in the competition before and Chelsea's visit was billed as the biggest match in their history.
As the club's volatile fans crammed into the stadium hours before kick-off, whipping the atmosphere to fever pitch, it was easy to see why they were unbeaten in the last 11 home European matches.
In such a seething cauldron of noise, Grant needed Chelsea's stars to show their greater experience at this rarified level.
Every touch by a Chelsea player was greeted with an ear-splitting barrage of whistles, but Grant's side have survived equally hostile environments many times before.
They made an assured start and scored with their first serious attack in the 13th minute.
Frank Lampard cleverly dummied Ashley Cole's pass, allowing Florent Malouda to find space on the left side of the penalty area.
He drove a low cross towards Didier Drogba and Deivid tried to clear but only succeeded in deflecting the ball past by wrong-footed keeper Volkan Demirel into his own net.
Confidence now flowing, Michael Essien almost doubled Chelsea's lead moments later with a swerving 25-yard strike that skimmed the crossbar.
Drogba's muscular presence unsettled Zico's team time and again.
He easily turned Gokcek Vederson to fire in a powerful shot that Demirel pushed away.
With the hosts in disarray, Michael Ballack had yards of space to produce a majestic defence-splitting pass to Drogba.
The Ivorian striker was only denied a goal by Demirel's charge from his line to hack clear.
The hosts could only improve after half-time and finally put together an attack of note when Alex glanced a header wide from Onder Turaci's cross.
Kazim-Kazim was an unlikely savour for Fenerbahce.
He was called Kazim-Richards when he was bought by Brighton with a transfer fee donated by a fan who won a League Cup competition but changed his name after moving to Turkey last year.
He certainly added some fizz to his side and Mateja Kezman responded with an overhead kick which Carlo Cudicini blocked at his near post.
Ballack's long-range effort drew a fine save from Demirel as Chelsea responded.
Then out of nowhere Fenerbahce equalised as Grant's side were caught sleeping at the back in the 65th minute.
Mehmet Aurelio's pass cut out Chelsea's centre-backs and Kazim-Kazim timed his run perfectly before lashing it past Cudicini.
I can't believe it! beamed Kazim-Kazim.
To score the goal with my left foot for the first time ever, and against Chelsea is unbelievable! 
Ballack should have restored Chelsea's lead moments later but Demirel saved well to frustrate the German again.
How Chelsea would rue that miss.
There seemed little danger when Deivid took possession 30 yards out in the 81st minute.
He quickly disproved that theory with a stunning strike that arrowed into the top corner.
Ballack said afterwards: We are very disappointed.
We had a big chance to win here.
Even after the 1-1 we had two good chances, me and Didier to score the second goal.
But we didn't concentrate enough.
We have to go again next week.
It was our fault, the game was in our hands.
Arsenal and Liverpool drew 1-1 in an end-to-end Champions League quarter-final first leg match at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.
Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor headed Arsenal in front after 23 minutes when he rose unchallenged to power the ball past keeper Pepe Reina from close range.
Arsenal's joy was short-lived, however, as Liverpool equalised in the 26th minute when captain Steven Gerrard surged past three defenders wide on the left and crossed for Dutch striker Dirk Kuyt to slide home.
Wednesday's match was the first of three between the teams inside seven days as they face each other again in the Premier League at the Emirates on Saturday before the return leg at Anfield next Tuesday.
The 200th meeting between the old rivals who first met in 1893 was a superb advert for the English game, even though only three Englishmen played Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard of Liverpool and halftime Arsenal substitute Theo Walcott.
The game had all the power, speed and high tempo play typical of the Premier League and while Arsenal created the better chances, Liverpool defended superbly.
Their only slip was to leave Adebayor free to score his 24th goal of the season and his second in successive games in the Champions League.
Arsenal took a deserved lead after Robin van Persie had twice gone close.
The Dutch forward had a great chance to put Arsenal ahead after 20 minutes when he found himself in space and onside after escaping his markers after collecting a 50-metre pass from Mathieu Flamini.
Somehow though, with only Reina to beat, he sent a left-foot volley high over the bar.
Two minutes later he forced Reina into a low dive to his left to force a corner from which Arsenal scored.
Van Persie's cross found the unmarked Adebayor and the tall striker rose unchallenged to powerfully head home.
Gerrard, who had an outstanding game, provided a quick response with the cross for Kuyt who nipped in between Philippe Senderos and Gael Clichy to equalise.
The match developed into an absorbing duel for midfield supremacy with both teams looking to push forward although Arsenal created the better chances.
Walcott went close with a searing 54th minute shot that went wide and two minutes later Arsenal appeared to have legitimate claims for a penalty denied when Kuyt seemed to pull back Aleksandr Hleb's left shoulder inside the box.
Dutch referee Pieter Vink, who did not need to use cards throughout the game, waved play on. 
Liverpool striker Fernando Torres gave his Spanish compatriot and Arsenal keeper Manuel Almunia some worrying moments in the second half but failed to add to the 28 goals he has scored this season.
Liverpool were fortunate twice in the space of five minutes midway through the second half.
Defender Martin Skrtel cleared an Emmanuel Eboue shot off the line and a shot from Cesc Fabregas hit Arsenal team mate Nicklas Bendtner standing on the Liverpool goal-line.
Paris St Germain moved out of Ligue 1's relegation zone with a 1-0 victory over Racing Strasbourg at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday.
Ivory Coast forward Amara Diane struck from close range on 73 minutes to give the Parisians three precious points from their first outing since Saturday's 2-1 League Cup final win over Racing Lens.
That match had been marred by a racist banner unfolded by PSG supporters and the capital club were under tight scrutiny for Wednesday's game, during which no major incidents were reported.
PSG climb two spots to 17th, one place below Strasbourg, with seven games left.
Britain's Liam Tancock set a new world record of 24.47 seconds for the 50 metres backstroke at Britain's Olympic trials on Wednesday.
Tancock set the record on the first 50 of the men's 200 backstroke heats, eclipsing German Thomas Rupprath's mark of 24.80.
Everyone in the world has been queuing up for a world record, he told reporters.
I decided to go for it a few weeks ago.
I was feeling fast in training.
I am really pleased.
Ramon Sessions sank a jumper from the corner at the final buzzer Wednesday to give Milwaukee a 110-109 victory over Washington, spoiling the return of Wizards playmaker Gilbert Arenas.
Arenas, who had missed Washington's past 66 games with a left knee injury, scored 17 points and sank two free throws to give the Wizards a 109-108 lead with 15.1 seconds remaining.
The Bucks lost the ball, managed to force a jump ball with 6.3 seconds to play and took over with 1.1 second remaining, just enough time to find Sessions in the left corner for the winning shot.
As worrisome as the loss for the Wizards, who missed a chance to clinch a National Basketball Association playoff berth, were late injuries to starters Antawn Jamison and DeShawn Stevenson on the same night Arenas made his return.
Jamison was holding his right arm and Stevenson was grimacing in pain after hobbling to the bench favoring his right leg.
Arenas, nicknamed Agent Zero for his jersey number, received a standing ovation from a cheering crowd when he entered the game with 5:21 remaining in the first quarter.
The 26-year-old point guard averaged 28.5 points last season, third-best in the NBA, and led the Wizards with 22.4 points and 5.9 assists a game before undergoing knee surgery November 21, five days after his last prior game.
The three-time All-star scored his first points on a layup after playing just 33 seconds to give the Wizards an 18-14 lead, starting a run where Arenas scored 10 of 11 Wizards points.
Arenas hit 4-of-5 from the field in the opening quarter, including a pair of 3-pointers, and the Wizards led 33-30 after the first quarter, 61-54 at halftime and 86-78 entering the fourth quarter.
But Milwaukee went on a 7-0 run in the final minutes to seize a 108-107 lead, setting up the final dramatics.
The Bucks improved to 26-48, keeping their slim playoff hopes alive.
Washington fell to 38-37 in a fight with Toronto and Philadelphia for playoff position with two weeks remaining in the regular season.
Formula One could expand to 20 grands prix in future but that should be the upper limit, team bosses said at a motor sport business forum in Bahrain on Wednesday.
The current season has 18 races, after 17 last year and a record 19 in 2005.
I think 20 races is a big number but a sensible number, organisers quoted Red Bull team principal Christian Horner as saying in a review of the day's activities ahead of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix.
It's a huge logistical challenge but the way the teams are working with each other to self-regulate testing it is possible. 
Honda chief executive Nick Fry agreed: I think 20 grands prix is about right, he said.
The balance of traditional circuits in Europe and circuits in new continents is vital. 
Formula One needs to go where the commercial market is and that market is moving from Europe and North America to the Middle East and Asia. 
Formula One has two new venues this year, with a European Grand Prix in Valencia and the first night-time race in Singapore, but the U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis has gone.
Bahrain, which hosts the third round of the season, is currently the only Middle Eastern race but Abu Dhabi is pencilled in for next year while India and South Korea are scheduled for 2010.
A third Middle Eastern race could also be on the cards, with Dubai and Qatar interested and already having lavish facilities in place.
We should have 20 races but not more. The future is definitely the Middle East region, said Force India's Colin Kolles. 
There is a lot of investment coming out of this region and that is what is needed in Formula One.
McLaren boss Ron Dennis added that any expansion should not come at the expense of the European winter break.
I welcome this expansion, and heartily commend Bernie Ecclestone for spearheading it, he told delegates.
But I have two provisos: Firstly, that the season never expands to more than 20 grands prix, which I regard as a natural logistical limit and, secondly, that we preserve a closed season over the winter.
The closed season is essential not only for logistical reasons but also in order to stir up a sense of anticipation in the hearts and minds of F1 fans. 
FIA President Max Mosley will not be attending Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix after sexual revelations about him in a British tabloid newspaper.
A spokesman for the governing International Automobile Federation confirmed on Wednesday that Mosley, would miss the third race of the Formula One season.
The FIA President was originally scheduled to attend the race in Bahrain but legal matters have detained him in London, he said.
In a letter sent to all national FIA clubs and bodies, including the World Motor Sport Council, Mosley apologised on Tuesday for any embarrassment caused by revelations in Sunday's News of the World tabloid.
He said he intended to issue legal proceedings against the newspaper in the UK and other jurisdictions and also made clear he had no intention of resigning, despite calls for him to do so.
I will not allow any of this to impede my commitment to the FIA, he wrote.
Barcelona and Villarreal failed to put the pressure on leaders Real Madrid as they dropped points in the Primera Liga on Sunday.
Real Mallorca had held the champions to a 1-1 draw on Saturday but Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona side drew 0-0 at home to UEFA Cup quarter-finalists Getafe, while Villarreal's nine-game unbeaten run ended with a 2-0 defeat away to Sevilla.
Real have 66 points, and are seven clear of Villarreal and Barcelona tied in second and third respectively on 59 points, with seven games left to play.
Getafe's well-organised defence gave Barca few sights of goal at the Nou Camp the woodwork and Argentina goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri did the rest.
Samuel Eto'o struck a post in the first half and Giovani dos Santos repeated the feat at the start of the second.
Xavi hit an upright at a free kick as Barca's attacks became more desperate and Abbondanzieri saved Eidur Gudjohnsen's point-blank header. 
Barca were whistled off the pitch at the end.
Villarreal were always up against it at the Sanchez Pizjuan and were pegged back by Sevilla's Brazil striker Luis Fabiano, who raced clear to score his 23rd of the campaign midway through the first half.
Diego Lopez made a string of important saves to keep the visitors in the game, but gave away a penalty three minutes from time, which Mali striker Frederic Kanoute put away.
Atletico Madrid beat nine-man Almeria 6-3 to strengthen their grip on fourth place with 53 points.
The home side were cruising inside six minutes after a free kick from Antonio Lopez, a penalty from Uruguay's Diego Forlan, and a red card for visiting defender Ruben Pulido.
But Almeria stormed back to level by the 17th minute.
Portugal winger Simao Sabrosa restored Atletico's lead with a free kick which the keeper fumbled into his own net, but again Almeria equalised.
Unai Emery's side were reduced to nine men in the 40th minute, and Simao's breakaway goal just before the break effectively ended their brave resistance. 
Argentine striker Sergio Aguero wrapped up the scoring for Atletico with two in the second half.
Racing Santander stumbled to a 3-1 home defeat to Deportivo Coruna and are fifth on 50 points, two ahead of Sevilla in sixth.
At the foot of the standings, Real Zaragoza's 3-0 home defeat to Real Betis left them deep in relegation trouble in 18th with 33 points, three adrift of 17th-placed Recreativo Huelva.
Real Murcia, who beat King's Cup finalists Valencia 1-0, are 19th with 29 and bottom club Levante, who lost 3-0 against Valladolid, have 19.
Two goals in two minutes from Djibril Cisse and Mamadou Niang helped Olympique Marseille defeat Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon 3-1 on Sunday.
It was Marseille's first victory at the Stade Velodrome over the six times French champions since September 1997.
Marseille, who won 2-1 at Lyon earlier this season, also became the first side in this campaign to pick up six points against Lyon.
Cisse and Niang scored in the 26th and 28th minute shooting home backpasses which caught Lyon's keeper Gregory Coupet off balance.
Lyon, who were on a run of six wins, got back into the game through an own goal from Marseille captain Lorik Cana, who misheaded Juninho's long-range free kick in the dying seconds of the first half.
Despite having to replace injured defensive midfielder Jeremy Toulalan and striker Fred by Kim Kallstrom and Hatem Ben Arfa in the 11th and 31st minute, the French champions stepped up a gear in the second half.
Niang sealed his team's victory when he headed home a Benoit Cheyrou centre in the 54th minute.
With six matches left, the result cut Lyon's lead to six points over Girondins Bordeaux, who won 2-0 at Stade Rennes on Saturday.
Marseille stay fourth three points adrift of AS Nancy who kept the ticket to the Champions League qualifying round with a 1-0 home win over relegation-threatened Paris St Germain earlier on Sunday.
Nancy's winning goal was scored by Marc-Antoine Fortune who headed home in the 69th minute shortly after PSG had an effort controversially disallowed for offside after a one-two between Pedro Pauleta and Amana Diane.
The defeat puts PSG back into the drop zone. 
They are 18th, level on 35 points with Racing Lens, Toulouse and Strasbourg, although above the latter on goal difference.
Bottom club Metz have just 18 points and are certain to be relegated.
Bayern Munich moved nine points clear in the Bundesliga with seven games to play after showing character to match their quality in a 3-1 win at home to VfL Bochum on Sunday.
Bayern, heading for a 21st German league title, went behind to a long-range shot from Mimoun Azaouagh in the fourth minute and they were in deeper trouble when Mark van Bommel was red-carded in the 27th minute.
The Bavarians began the fightback with a Lucio header four minutes later before a second-half Franck Ribery penalty and a late strike from Christian Lell saw them home.
We showed unbelievable spirit to turn the game around, coach Ottmar Hitzfeld told Premiere TV.
Bayern have 57 points from 27 games, followed by Schalke 04 on 48 after their 1-0 win at home to Hansa Rostock on Saturday.
Hamburg SV, beaten 1-0 at resurgent VfB Stuttgart on Saturday, drop to third with 47, ahead of Werder Bremen on goal difference after their 2-1 win at Hertha Berlin.
Stuttgart, last season's champions, climb to fifth on 45 points, with Bayern Leverkusen sixth on 44 after they suffered a last-gasp 2-1 defeat at Borussia Dortmund on Sunday.
Bayern needed to atone for a careless display in Thursday's 1-1 draw with Getafe in the UEFA Cup, a result that leaves them with a lot to do to clinch a place in the semi-finals.
They were rocked when Azaouagh's right-foot shot from over 25 metres flew past Oliver Kahn and into the top left-hand corner.
Two needless bookings for Van Bommel left them in deeper trouble but they were back in the game when Lucio headed in a Bastian Schweinsteiger free kick for his first league goal of the season.
Bayern got a deserved second when Ribery converted a penalty for handball with 16 minutes to go. 
I've been in this situation many times before and little bits of luck, good or bad, can decide your season, said goalkeeper Kahn.
We weren't doing so well at a goal down and with Van Bommel off but we gave it everything to come back.
American Johnson Wagner won the Houston Open by two strokes after a final-round 71 on Sunday to pocket $1 million and a place in next week's U.S. Masters.
The 313th-ranked Wagner, who fired a course record-tying nine-under-par 63 in the opening round, led wire-to-wire finishing with a 16-under 272 total at Redstone Golf Club.
Tied for second place at 14-under 274 were Australian Geoff Ogilvy and American Chad Campbell, one stroke better than Americans Fred Couples and Billy Mayfair.
This is unbelievable, 28-year-old Wagner told NBC TV after clinching his first U.S. Tour title at the 18th.
I can't believe I'm going to Augusta next week, This was a long time coming and a dream come true.
World number one Lorena Ochoa underlined her dominance in the women's game by charging to a second successive major title by five shots at the Kraft Nabisco Championship on Sunday.
The 26-year-old Mexican, a stroke ahead overnight, fired a flawless five-under-par 67 to pull away from the field on a breezy sun-drenched day at Mission Hills Country Club.
Ochoa, who clinched her first major title at last year's Women's British Open, closed the door on the chasing pack with a three-birdie run from the eighth before finishing at 11-under 277.
Ochoa won last year's British Open at St. Andrews by four shots, having led from the opening round.
Three-times champion Sorenstam, who considered withdrawing during Saturday's third round at Mission Hills because of intense stomach pain, signed off with a 68 to tie for second place.
The Swedish world number two piled up five birdies and a lone bogey to finish at six under, level with Norway's Suzann Pettersen.
Chelsea will be without their goalkeeper Petr Cech for the next two weeks after he had surgery on his lips and chin on Monday following a training ground accident.
The 25-year-old suffered the injuries after a collision with a teammate in training.
He misses Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final second-leg match against Fenerbahce.
Cech has missed the past nine games and now faces a race to be fit for the crucial league match against Manchester United on April 26 as Chelsea, presently three points behind, try to pip United to the title.
He has been unlucky with injuries this year, Chelsea manager Avram Grant said.
But this is football - it happens.
It was a tackle between two players, it doesn't matter who, all that matters is he is injured.
This year is not a good year for him.
He was looking good in training.
I don't feel so good about it but every player that is injured doesn't make me happy.
Manchester United received a boost ahead of their Champions League quarter-final, second leg at home to AS Roma with the news on Monday that defender Rio Ferdinand has not broken a bone in his foot.
The England defender is still doubtful for Wednesday's match at Old Trafford, however, with United's medical staff not confirming how long he might be out of action.
Rio went for a scan on Monday and we can confirm that he has not suffered any break, a club official told United's Web site.
Manager Alex Ferguson had feared the worst after watching the England defender limp off in the second half of Sunday's 2-2 draw at Middlesbrough that leaves United three points clear of Chelsea at the top of the Premier League with five games left.
Ferguson has already lost Ferdinand's defensive partner Nemanja Vidic for at least two weeks.
The partnership has played a big part in United's assault on Premier League and Champions League honours this season.
Ferguson, whose team won the first leg 2-0 in Rome last week, is expected to provide an update on Ferdinand at his pre-match news conference on Tuesday.
Luxembourg's Kim Kirchen unexpectedly took the second stage of the Tour of the Basque Country after winning a bunch sprint on Tuesday.
Kirchen beat Italian Paolo Bettini in the mass dash for the line with David Herrero of Spain finishing third.
I never expected to have such a good result here, Kirchen told reporters.
It was a real surprise for me, because I've been ill in the build-up to this race and there are a lot of big favourites.
But I felt good during the stage, got in a good position in the last kilometre and decided to have a try for the win.
Tour de France champion Alberto Contador retained the overall lead and Kirchen admitted he cannot challenge the race leader.
No, that's not possible, the High Road rider responded.
I'm happy with just one stage win.
Despite numerous late attacks in the final section of the hilly 153-kms stage, Astana rider Contador remains three seconds ahead of fellow countryman Ezequiel Mosquera with Herrero eight seconds behind in thrid.
Wednesday's 195-kms stage from Erandio to Viana has four classified climbs and should feature more attacks on Contador.
The Tour of the Basque Country finishes with a time trial in Orio on April 12th.
American Lindsay Davenport reached the second round of the 600,000-dollar WTA Bausch and Lomb Championship on Tuesday with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over compatriot Vania King.
Davenport is 43-6 with four titles since she returned to the WTA seven months ago after missing just under a year to have her first child.
In 10 trips to Amelia Island, Davenport is 30-5 with titles in 1997, 2004 and 2005.
Davenport, next faces American Jill Craybas and could meet third seed Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia in the third round.
Hantuchova and other top-eight seeds had an opening bye.
Hungarian eighth seed Agnes Szavay became the first to reach the third round by dispatching Russian Ekaterina Makarova 6-4, 6-1.
Top seed Maria Sharapova, returning from a two-week break, was to face Czech qualifier Barbora Zahlavova Strycova and French fourth seed Marion Bartoli was to meet Olga Govortsova of Belarus in later second-round matches.
Sharapova, making her first Amelia Island appearance, sat out the Miami event because of a right shoulder injury and fatigue.
The 20-year-old Russian beauty has not played since suffering her first loss of the year in an Indian Wells semi-final against countrywoman Svetlana Kuznetsova.
Sharapova, seeking her first clay-court final after three prior semi-final defeats on the surface, won her first 18 matches of the year, including titles at the Australian Open and Doha.
Liverpool beat Arsenal 4-2 in a classic Champions League battle at Anfield on Tuesday to reach the semi-finals for the third time in four seasons.
Liverpool won 5-3 on aggregate with Steven Gerrard scoring an 85th-minute penalty a minute after Emmanuel Adebayor had scored to put Arsenal level at 2-2 and ahead on away goals.
Arsenal took the lead through Adebayor after 13 minutes but Liverpool fought back with goals from Sami Hyypia after 30 minutes and Fernando Torres in the 69th.
Substitute Ryan Babel sealed the win with a stoppage time goal.
The tension at Anfield was almost unbearable throughout the match that will go down as one of the best played in Europe's elite competition.
Michael Ballack and Frank Lampard were both on target as Chelsea beat Fenerbahce 2-0 Tuesday to secure their place in the last four of the Champions League.
After a 2-1 defeat in the first leg last week, the result secured Avram Grant9s side a 3-2 aggregate success.
It took Chelsea just four minutes to settle their nerves.
A 1-0 lead, with the advantage of an away goal, left them theoretically vulnerable, and although that remained the margin until three minutes from time, they were never truly in any trouble.
Lampard laid on the first, sending in a typically accurate free-kick in from the right.
Ballack met his cross with a glancing header, and goalkeeper Volkan Demirak could only watch it bounce across him and inside the far post.
It was the German9s sixth goal of the season and, crucially, it wiped out Fenerbahce9s first-leg advantage.
Zico9s side, though, had found themselves even worse off in the previous round, when they were 2-0 down inside 10 minutes of the second leg against Sevilla.
Comebacks have been a way of life for them this season - they took four points from their two group games against CSKA Moscow despite being behind in both, and hit back from a 1-0 deficit to beat Kayserispor with two goals in the last 25 minutes in the league on Saturday - but this time it wasn9t to be.
They didn9t panic, but they rarely looked dangerous either, and the first real drama in the Chelsea box came after 24 minutes when goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini went down with a knee injury.
Already without Petr Cech, their number one, who needed 50 stitches in a facial wound after a training-ground collision with defender Tal Ben Haim, that left Chelsea having to throw on their third choice, Hilario.
His only real involvement of the first half, though was to make a simple save from a Diego Lugano header from Alex9s free-kick. 
The second half was largely a question of marking time, with Chelsea content to hold possession and Fenerbahce incapable of stealing it from them.
Lampard eventually settled things three minutes from time, firing in from Michael Essien9s cross.
The only down side for them was that Essien, booked with four minutes remaining, will miss the first leg of the semi-final through suspension.
Chelsea face Liverpool for the third time in four years in the semi-final later this month.
Arsene Wenger blamed the referee and his own defence for Arsenal's 4-2 defeat in an astonishing Champions League quarter-final at Liverpool on Tuesday.
The Gunners were seven minutes away from advancing to the semi-finals on the away goals rule after making the score 2-2 on the night, but went out 5-3 on aggregate after two late Liverpool goals.
A controversial penalty award by Swedish referee Peter Frojdfeldt for a tug on Ryan Babel by Kolo Toure saw Steven Gerrard score the crucial goal to put Liverpool 3-2 ahead with five minutes to play.
To rub salt into Wenger's wounds, Arsenal had an identical appeal for a penalty dismissed in the first leg at the Emirates Stadium last week when Liverpool held them to a 1-1 draw in London.
We have a feeling of disappointment and injustice.
At the moment it is difficult because the whole dressing room is down, Wenger said.
The game is over for us.
It was down to a dodgy decision, I believe, from the referee.
Over the two games it was difficult to swallow.
It was a double disappointment because all the big decisions went against us.
We have to live with that.
Sometimes you have to swallow the unswallowable.
It is difficult to understand for me.
I have watched it clearly again, but last week it was definitely a penalty.
Wenger felt his defence played a part in Arsenal's downfall as Sami Hyypia was allowed a free header to equalise Abou Diaby's opener and Fernando Torres found time to turn and score his side's second.
After Gerrard's penalty, Babel completed the scoring with a stoppage-time fourth.
We had so much control but we were naive and we lacked a bit defensively, Wenger added.
The defeat was not down to mental strength though.
it was down to a lack of experience defensively.
We made big mistakes and we conceded a goal from a corner and on the second goal we gave Fernando Torres too much room.
Arsenal have now won just two of their last 12 games and only have the Premier League title to chase.
They are six points behind leaders Manchester United with five games to play.
Wenger believes a series of poor decisions and injuries to key players have affected his side.
We feel everything is going against us.
We lacked that extra bit of confidence because week after week there is more disappointment, he grumbled.
Barcelona's hopes of wresting the league title from Real Madrid suffered another blow on Saturday when they twice surrendered the lead to draw 2-2 at relegation-threatened Recreativo Huelva.
Samuel Eto'o put Barca in front at the start of each half but Recreativo's Argentine striker Marco Ruben hit back twice with headed equalisers the first a controversial effort that did not appear to cross the line.
The draw left Barca six points behind leaders Real Madrid with six games to play but the champions could extend that to nine if they beat struggling Real Murcia at the Bernabeu on Sunday.
The Catalans have won just one of their last seven league games and are only a point ahead of Villarreal, who can reclaim second place if they beat or draw with mid-table Almeria on Sunday.
Earlier on Saturday, surprise package Racing Santander piled the pressure on Ronald Koeman's beleaguered Valencia when a late Mohamed Tchite strike gave them a 2-1 win at the Mestalla.
Valencia, who meet Getafe in the King's Cup final on Wednesday, have won just one of their last nine league games and are only six points above the relegation zone in 14th place with almost all of their closest rivals yet to play.
They have won only once at the Mestalla in the last five months and have the joint worst home record in the league with basement side Levante.
Racing remain in fifth place but are now level on 53 points with Atletico Madrid who visit Valladolid on Sunday.
Barca, missing the injured Ronaldinho, Bojan Krkic, Thierry Henry, Andres Iniesta and Deco, could not have got off to a better start against Recreativo.
Eto'o put them in front with just over a minute on the clock when he headed in at the far post after Giovani dos Santos swept a fine cross in from the right.
Recreativo fought back strongly, however, and gave the Barca back four several scares with their quick counter-attacks and had them on the ropes at the end of the half.
They equalised in controversial fashion, however, just before the break when the referee awarded a goal after Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes appeared to stop Ruben's header on the line.
Barca started the second half as they had begun the first, Eto'o restoring their lead after just over a minute when he sent an unstoppable swerving drive high into the net to take his tally for the season to 14 goals in 14 games.
But Recre continued to create problems for the Barca defence and claimed a deserved equaliser that left them four points above the drop zone when Ruben steered an angled header in at the far post after getting behind fullback Eric Abidal.
The only positive note for Barca was that Lionel Messi returned to action after over a month out when he came on as a substitute for the final 26 minutes.
Hasan Salihamidzic struck twice to give Juventus a 3-2 win over 10-man AC Milan on Saturday that severely dented the Rossoneri's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
Third-placed Juve, who face Parma in a game in hand on Wednesday, are close to sealing a qualifying place for Europe's premier competition in their first season back in the top flight following their match-fixing demotion and subsequent promotion.
Juve are nine points clear of last season's Champions League winners Milan, who are in fifth spot and four points behind Fiorentina having played a game more.
The Florence club, who occupy the final Champions League qualifying place, have six games left and visit leaders Inter Milan on Sunday when second-placed AS Roma travel to Udinese.
We will try just like we have tonight, Milan boss and former Juve coach Carlo Ancelotti told Sky.
Juve boss Claudio Ranieri was thrilled his side fought back from 2-1 down thanks to rare goals from Bosnian Salihamidzic on halftime and 10 minutes from the end.
We have been able to play the match we wanted.
3-2, it's been a really great game, Juve coach Ranieri said.
Milan went into the big match in Turin without suspended defenders Alessandro Nesta and Kakha Kaladze while Brazilian forward Alexandre Pato was injured.
Juve quickly exploited a second string defence when Mauro Camoranesi hurdled a tackle and played in Alessandro Del Piero, who netted his 14th league goal of the campaign from a tight angle on 12 minutes.
Ex-Juve striker Filippo Inzaghi, who like Del Piero looks poised to miss out on Italy's Euro 2008 squad, soon levelled with a trademark poacher's goal from Kaka's cross from the left.
With all the talk about Ronaldinho's likely arrival at Milan, the 34-year-old Inzaghi showed his worth with a second on half an hour when he sidefooted in after Daniele Bonera had squared the ball following Massimo Ambrosini's clever chip.
Juve, who lost 3-2 at Palermo last weekend, made it 2-2 just before the break when Paolo Maldini gave the ball away and Camoranesi crossed for David Trezeguet, whose header was blocked by keeper Zeljko Kalac only for winger Salihamidizic to score.
The second half failed to match the liveliness of the first before Milan defender Bonera slipped and planted his studs on Mohamed Sissoko's shin and received a straight red card.
Camoranesi then made sure he set up all three Juve goals when his free kick was nodded in unmarked by Salihamidzic.
Earlier on Saturday in the Sicilian derby, Fabrizio Miccoli bent in a free kick five minutes from time to hand Palermo a 1-0 home win and leave Catania three points above the drop zone The visitors, in Walter Zenga's second game in charge, had the better of the first half with striker Gionatha Spinesi stabbing over but mid-table Palermo gradually improved.
Olympique Marseille boosted their Champions League hopes with a 2-1 win at relegated Metz on Saturday.
Goals from Djibril Cisse and Samir Nasri moved Marseille up to third place at the expense of Nancy, defeated 2-1 at Lille.
Marseille and Nancy are both on 55 points from 33 games but the southerners lead their rivals on goal difference.
The top two in Ligue 1 qualify for the Champions League with the third-placed team entering the showcase event's qualifying round.
Despite an early goal by Cedric Barbosa, Metz were relegated to Ligue 2 with 18 points, 17 points from safety with five games left.
Troubled Paris Saint-Germain are a place above the relegation zone and host Nice on Sunday.
Leaders Olympique Lyon were held to a 1-1 home draw by Stade Rennes earlier on Saturday after Stephane M'bia equalised for the visitors in added time.
A powerful header by Cris had put the six-times French champions ahead, the defender rising to meet a corner from fellow Brazilian Juninho on 16 minutes.
Cameroon midfielfer M'bia gave Rennes a share of the points just before the final whistle, also with a header from a corner.
Lyon, chasing a seventh consecutive title, are on 68 points from 33 games, seven points ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux, who host Caen on Sunday.
Fulham and Bolton Wanderers earned Premier League lifelines on Saturday with victories over Reading and West Ham United respectively to keep their survival hopes alive with four games remaining.
Goals by Brian McBride and Erik Nevland secured Fulham's 2-0 win, their first away success in the league in 19 months, while Bolton ended a dire run with a 1-0 home victory over West Ham courtesy of a Kevin Davies goal.
With Birmingham City drawing 1-1 at home to Everton, the day's results have tightened up the battle at the bottom.
Derby County, already relegated and thumped 6-0 at home by Aston Villa on Saturday, are bottom on 11 points. 
Fulham have 27, Bolton 29, Birmingham 31, Reading 32 and Wigan Athletic, with a game in hand, on 34.
The top four are in action later this weekend as on Sunday leaders Manchester United play Arsenal at Old Trafford and Liverpool face Blackburn Rovers while Chelsea host Wigan on Monday.
Everton are two points behind Liverpool on 61 points, Portsmouth after sixth on 57 after a goalless home draw with Newcastle United while Villa have 55.
Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez displayed nerves of steel to win a marathon doubles match on Saturday and propel Spain into the Davis Cup semi-finals.
They battled for almost five hours before grinding out a 6-7 7-6 6-4 2-6 12-10 win over Philipp Kohlschreiber and Philipp Petzschner, giving Spain an unbeatable 3-0 lead over Germany in Bremen.
The twice former champions are now eager to meet holders the United States and avenge last year's 4-1 quarter-final defeat.
The Americans lead their tie against France 2-1 in Winston-Salem and, despite going down in the doubles, will be favourites to seal their passage into the last four.
Top-ranked Mike and Bob Bryan missed out on a chance to become the most successful American doubles pairing when they lost 6-7 7-5 6-3 6-4 to Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra.
They had shared a 14-1 win-loss Davis Cup record with John McEnroe and Peter Fleming but must now wait before securing a 15th win.
Argentina and Russia moved a step closer to meeting in the other semi-final after both nations won their doubles clashes to take a 2-1 lead into Sunday's reverse singles.
David Nalbandian and Guillermo Canas made the most of the raucous Buenos Aires atmosphere to beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman and Robert Linstedt 7-5 6-4 6-4 in an ill-tempered match.
Visiting teams have often complained about the crowd's overzealous behaviour in Argentina and on Saturday it was the Swedes who found the Estadio Parque Roca an inhospitable place.
Tempers frayed in the second set when Sweden captain Mats Wilander, amid jeering and whistling, complained to the umpire that Nalbandian was using time-wasting tactics to disrupt his team's rhythm.
I think they got a bit unnerved, Nalbandian told reporters.
I wanted to make the public happy by winning, so we played every point as if it was the last.
Canas said the atmosphere was comparable to a soccer match.
It was somewhat like football because representing Argentina is something unique, something which you feel in your skin, he said.
In Moscow, the Czechs found Russia to be perfect hosts and were given a roaring welcome when they stepped on court but the generosity in spirit stopped there.
World number four Nikolay Davydenko teamed up with Igor Andreev to outsmart Czech duo Pavel Vizner and Radek Stepanek 3-6 6-3 7-5 6-4.
Russia captain Shamil Tarpishchev had left Davydenko out of Friday's singles after the player flew in late to Moscow following his triumph in Miami last weekend.
Feeling fresh after enjoying a rest day, Davydenko proved his doubles game could be as lethal as his singles and he took great pleasure in stifling the Czech challenge.
Igor and I play well together.
After the first set we were able to relax, we had fun playing and we weren't nervous, Davydenko told reporters.
Andreev added: If I was to judge our play today I would give us five and them four minus.
Metz's slender hopes of playing first division football for the second straight season disappeared on Saturday with a 2-1 loss to Marseille seeing them slip through the relegation trap door.
Cedric Barbosa gave the home fans at the Stade Saint-Symphorien some hope when putting Metz into a three minute lead but Marseille hit back through former Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse and Samir Nasri for their 22nd defeat of the campaign.
With a mere 19 points to their name Metz' position is hopeless with an uncatchable 16 point gap to the fourth from bottom club, Paris Saint Germain with only a maximum 15 points left to play for this term.
Marseille moved up to 55 points and go third on goal difference ahead of Nancy, beaten 2-1 at Lille.
Metz coach Yvon Pouliquen, summing up the sombre mood, said: 'Disappointment is everywhere after this defeat.
I'm upset at the result but not with the manner of the defeat.
Marseille scored twice from three chances in the match, that efficiency made the difference.
Real Madrid stayed on course to retain the Spanish title after they recovered from a first-half sending-off to clinch a 1-0 win over relegation-threatened Real Murcia at the Bernabeu on Sunday.
Real, who had won just one of their previous four matches, looked to be in trouble when fullback Miguel Torres was given a straight red for ploughing into Murcia midfielder Dani Aquino on 20 minutes.
But despite a poor performance they managed to make off with the points thanks to a flash of brilliance from Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder who curled a shot into the corner on the hour after dispossessing a defender on the edge of the area.
With six matches left to play, Real lead the table on 69 points, nine ahead of Barcelona, who were held 2-2 at Recreativo Huelva on Saturday, and 10 clear of Villarreal who are away to Almeria in Sunday's late match.
Behind the top three, the race for the remaining Champions League place hotted up after Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at Valladolid while Sevilla clinched a 3-2 win away against Real Mallorca.
Atletico looked to be on course for a narrow win after Argentine midfielder Maxi Rodriguez put the visitors in front with a spectacular half-volley midway through the second half.
But Valladolid snatched a valuable point when Nigerian striker Bartholomew Ogbeche got in behind the Atletico defence to steer home at the near post.
Atletico remain in fourth place on 54 points but are only one ahead of Racing Santander, who beat Valencia 2-1 on Saturday, and three clear of Sevilla.
The Andalucians claimed an important away win over Mallorca thanks to goals from Renato, Frederic Kanoute and Daniel Alves.
Espanyol continued their desperate run in the second half of the season when they lost their eighth game in 10 outings in a 1-0 defeat at home to Osasuna.
Basement side Levante claimed their first points in six games after a 1-0 win away to Real Betis but they remain seven points adrift of Murcia at the bottom.
Real Zaragoza are also in serious trouble after being held to a 0-0 draw at Getafe.
They have won just three of their last 22 games and remain in the relegation places, three points behind Recreativo Huelva.
Argentine forward Fernando Cavenaghi struck twice to give Girondins Bordeaux a 2-1 win over Caen 2-1 on Sunday that closed the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon to four points.
Cavenaghi deflected in a free kick by Brazilian midfielder Wendel to give Bordeaux a 52nd minute lead before converting a 77th minute penalty after Caen defender Nicolas Seube handled the ball in the area.
Defender Jeremy Sorbon reduced the arrears for the visitors with a volley from close range a minute from time.
Second-placed Bordeaux, who were thrashed 5-0 at Caen earlier this season, moved on to 64 points from 33 games, four behind Lyon, with five matches left.
Lyon, chasing a seventh consecutive title, were held to a 1-1 home draw by Stade Rennes on Saturday.
Bayern Munich moved closer to winning their 21st German championship on Sunday by thrashing
Borussia Dortmund 5-0 and opening up a 10-point lead over second-placed Werder Bremen.
Bayern were 4-0 up after 22 minutes, Italy striker Luca Toni scoring twice after Lukas Podolski and Ze Roberto had given them a two-goal lead inside 10 minutes.
Andreas Ottl got the fifth in midway through the second half.
The two teams will meet again next Saturday in the German Cup final in Berlin.
Bayern are top with 60 points, with six matches remaining.
Werder Bremen, after a 5-1 win over Schalke 04 on Saturday, have 50 points, two ahead of Schalke in third.
Schalke sacked coach Mirko Slomka on Sunday after that debacle.
This was an important step for winning the championship, said Bayern's usually cautious sporting director Uli Hoeness.
We've got a 10-point lead with only three away matches. 
I don't think there's much that could happen to stop us now. 
Bayern are chasing three titles. They are also in the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup.
In Sunday's other match, Bayer Leverkusen beat VfB Stuttgart 3-0 to move into fourth place on 47 points.
Even without playmaker Franck Ribery, rested after Thursday's 3-3 draw at Getafe in the UEFA Cup quarter-final, Bayern were awesome at the start.
Podolski opened the scoring in the third minute in front of another sell-out crowd of 69,000 with a curling long range shot from the right to the far post.
Ze Roberto doubled the lead five minutes later when he tapped in a superb Phillip Lahm cross from the left.
Toni got his 17th and 18th league goals of the season in the space of five minutes, opening up a three-goal lead in the top scorers' chart ahead of Stuttgart's Mario Gomez.
Toni first beat Dortmund defender Christian Woerns on the right and fired in from short range and then volleyed home a Ze Roberto lob.
Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said: We went out at a high pace even though the match at Getafe was so exhausting.
The first goal was excellent and once we got ahead everything clicked. 
Dortmund coach Thomas Doll said: I'm still trying to figure out what we were doing here. It felt like an execution. 
Dortmund midfielder Florian Kringe was also blunt about his team's performance.
If you're going to let Bayern play like that you shouldn't even make the trip to Munich, he said. You're better off not even getting out of bed. 
Second seed Tommy Robredo got his 2008 campaign off to a forgettable start when he was beaten in straight sets by Agustin Calleri in the Qatar Open on Tuesday.
The Spanish world number 10 never recovered after losing his first service game and went on to a 6-4 6-4 defeat against the unseeded Argentine.
Russian top seed Nikolay Davydenko and third seed Andy Murray of Britain cruised into the second round with resounding wins over Benedikt Dorsch of Germany and Olivier Rochus of Belgium.
Davydenko posted a 6-3 6-0 win in one hour 14 minutes to set up a second-round clash against French veteran Fabrice Santoro while Murray took four minutes longer to sail past Rochus 6-0 6-2.
Murray will take on wildcard and former champion Rainer Schuettler of Germany, who beat Romania's Andrei Pavel 1-6 6-2 6-0.
Calleri, who went 2-0 up against Robredo, jumped to a 4-2 lead and then broke Robredo again in the seventh game to be serving for the set at 5-2.
But he faltered with two double faults and handed the game to Robredo, who held his serve for 5-4.
But Calleri did not err again as he served out the set 6-4 in 42 minutes.
Calleri broke the Robredo serve again in the fifth game of the second before serving out the match and completing victory with an emphatic overhead.
I am very disappointed being out of this tournament.
Robredo told reporters, I was trying all the time.
After I lost my serve in the first game and it put me under a lot of pressure.
I will be playing in Sydney next and will try to do my best there before the Australian Open, Robredo said.
In other matches on Tuesday, Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia beat Santiago Ventura of Spain 3-6 6-3 6-4 and Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka beat another Spaniard, qualifier Alberto Martin, 6-2 6-2.
Los Angeles Lakers forward Lamar Odom has been suspended for one game for flagrantly fouling Ray Allen of the Boston Celtics, the league said Tuesday.
Odom threw himself into Allen, knocking him to the court, late in the fourth quarter of the Lakers's 110-91 loss to the visiting Celtics on Sunday.
An eight-year veteran who averages 14.1 points and nine rebounds a game, Odom will serve his suspension on Jan 4 when the Lakers host the Philadelphia 76ers.
Olympic 100 metres champion Justin Gatlin has been banned for four years for a 2006 positive test for testosterone, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said on Tuesday.
USADA general counsel Bill Bock said a three-member U.S. arbitration panel, in a 2-1 split decision, had banned Gatlin for four years.
The suspension through to May 24, 2010 could end the career of the 25-year-old Gatlin if he does not successfully appeal to the International Association of Athletics Federations or the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The decision has not been released publicly.
The Washington Post reported on its Web site that two out of the three American Arbitration Association arbitrators had said they could not give less than a four-year ban because of a previous positive test.
A third dissented, the Post reported.
It took them five months to come to this? It's ridiculous, jeanette Gatlin said in a telephone interview from her Pensacola, Florida home.
I think everybody is blindsided by this opinion.
Gatlin, who has denied knowingly, taking performance-enhancing drugs, still hopes to compete again, his mother said.
There is no doubt about that, she said. We will be talking to his lawyer later today. 
Gatlin could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, John Collins, declined to comment.
Gatlin failed a drugs test in 2001 for a prescribed medication for Attention Deficit Disorder. He was reinstated by the International Association of Athletics Federations the following year.
The American won the 2004 Athens Olympic 100 metres title and completed a 100-200 double at the Helsinki world championships in 2005.
He won each of his five 100 metres competitions in 2006, including tying the then world record of 9.77 seconds in Doha and winning the U.S. title.
But after it was announced that Gatlin had returned a positive test for the male sex hormone testosterone at the 2006 Kansas Relays he was suspended while his case was referred to arbitration.
Defender Atsuto Uchida and Brazilian midfielder Danilo were on target as Kashima Antlers defeated Sanfrecce Hiroshima 2-0 to win the Emperor's Cup on Tuesday.
Uchida's clinical finish after eight minutes put Kashima in front and substitute Danilo added a late second as the Antlers completed a league and cup double and inflicted more heartbreak on Sanfreece just weeks after they were relegated to the second division.
The Emperor's Cup triumph was Kashima's first since they wrapped up an unprecedented domestic treble with a 3-2 win over Shimizu S-Pulse here in the 2000 season.
Kashima's opener came out of nothing, Uchida finding space to ram past Takashi Shimoda from a tight angle but a New Year's Day crowd of over 46,000 had little else to get excited about in a tepid first half at National Stadium.
Tomoaki Makino spurned a free header for Sanfrecce on 17 minutes and although Japan international Yuichi Komano caused Kashima plenty of problems on the right flank, he was unable to provide the telling pass in the final third.
Hiroshima started strongly in the second period but it was Kashima that twice went close to doubling their lead through Daiki Iwamasa and Yuzo Tashiro.
Motherwell midfielder Phil O'Donnell died from heart failure, the club said on Tuesday after a post-mortem.
The 35-year-old former Celtic player collapsed on the pitch during the Scottish Premier League match against Dundee United on Saturday and was pronounced dead at hospital having failed to regain consciousness.
The post-mortem revealed that Phil had suffered left ventricular failure of the heart, Motherwell club doctor Robert Liddle said on the club's Web site.
Several matches in Scotland have been postponed on Wednesday as a mark of respect for O'Donnell, including Motherwell's away game at Hibernian and the Old Firm match between Celtic and Rangers.
Tributes were also paid to O'Donnell before Tuesday's Premier League matches in England.
Jelena Jankovic suffered an injury scare ahead of this month's Australian Open when she was forced to retire from her singles match at the Hopman Cup on Wednesday because of injury.
The Serbian suffered the injury in the first game of her match with Tatiana Golovin of France, clutching the top of her right hamstring.
Jankovic received treatment from the physiotherapist after the first game and though she tried to play on, she was forced to withdraw midway through the second game.
If Jankovic is unable to play in the mixed doubles with Novak Djokovic, France will win the match and be favourites to reach Friday's final.
Both Serbia and France had won their opening matches of the eight-nation mixed team event.
The Australian Open begins in Melbourne on Jan. 14.
Russian number two Mikhail Youzhny overcame early season rust to beat unseeded Frenchman Edouard Roger-Vasselin 7-5 1-6 6-2 and reach the ATP Chennai Open third round on Wednesday.
Defending champion Xavier Malisse of Belgium continued his impressive comeback from a long injury layoff, upstaging Austrian Jurgen Melzer 7-6 6-2 to set up a third round clash with the Russian fourth seed.
Unseeded Malisse, whose dream start to 2007 turned sour following a serious wrist injury that left him ranked 112th in the world, showed his class to oust the sixth seed.
Former Spanish world number one Carlos Moya, twice a winner in Chennai, also went through after quelling an unexpected late challenge from Russian qualifier Alexandre Kudryavtsev.
The third seed won 6-3 6-7 6-2. Fourth seed Youzhny, the world number 19, made a sluggish start and had to dig deep in the first set after his 97th ranked French rival raced to 5-0.
The 25-year-old produced sublime tennis as he fought back, reeling off the next seven games and conceding just four points to his 24-year-old opponent.
Roger-Vesselin still raised hopes of only his second win over a top-20 player as Youzhny's game again tailed off in the second set, only for the Russian to restore order in the decider.
I'm still not 100 percent, he told reporters.
I'm trying to recover my best game but sometimes I'm not fast enough.
That is why my game is up and down.
Although I was not at the same level all match today, I'm happy I still showed my best game in the first week of the year.
Malisse, who was restricted to just five tournaments in 2007 after a fresh knee ligament injury late in the year, clinched a tight first set 7-3 in the tie-break.
He then wore down left-handed Melzer, the world number 60, in the second set as the Austrian made desperate forays to the net.
I'm very happy today, he said. I was more aggressive than the first match and served really well.
Top seed Nikolay Davydenko and third seed Andy Murray reached the quarter-finals of $1.5 million Qatar Open in contrasting style on Wednesday.
Davydenko, ranked fourth in the world, knocked out France's Fabrice Santoro with a regulation 6-3 6-3 scoreline to set up an all-Russian clash against Dmitry Tursunov on Thursday.
The eighth-seeded Tursunov got a walkover from Germany's Nicolas Keifer who pulled out of Wednesday's match because of a shoulder injury.
Murray, however, won a topsy-turvy match against former champion Rainer Schuettler of Germany 1-6 6-0 6-1.
Murray will take on Sweden's Thomas Johansson, a 6-3 7-5 winner over Michael Berrer of Germany, in the quarter-finals.
In other quarter-finals, defending champion and fourth seed Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia will meet sixth seed German Philipp Kohlschreiber while Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka will take on Argentine Augustin Calleri.
Ljubicic got a walkover from Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic, who pulled out with a fever, while Calleri continued his fine run with a 6-3 6-1 win over South Korean Hyung-Taik Lee.
Calleri upset second-seeded Spaniard Tommy Robredo in the first round.
Murray was a slow starter and Schuettler benefited from the Briton's erratic game in the opening set.
The German broke Murray in the second and sixth games to claim the set 6-1.
But world number 11 Murray broke the German three times in the second, fourth and sixth games.
In the decider too Murray gained an early upper hand with breaks in the second and sixth games and never looked back, wrapping up the set and match with a cross-court passing shot.
I am pleased with the way I hung in there and won.
I changed my style of play in the second and third sets.
I came to the net more and used the slice shots, Murray said.
Davydenko broke Santoro once in the first set and had two breaks in the second.
There are 250 points here and I would like to win the tournament, the Russian said.
Today, I was confident playing from the baseline.
I could control the game, he added.
South Korean boxer Choi Yo-sam, who suffered a brain haemorrhage during a title fight last week, died on Thursday after being taken off his life support machine, a hospital official said.
Choi's organs, including his heart, have been donated to six people in need, said a spokesman for Asan Medical Centre, the Seoul hospital which has been treating the boxer since he lapsed into a coma after his Dec. 25 title defence.
Choi, won the World Boxing Organisation intercontinental flyweight title on a unanimous decision over Heri Amol, but the Indonesian challenger dominated the 12th round, sending Choi to the canvas with a right to the jaw seconds before the final bell.
Choi staggered to his feet but collapsed shortly after the bout and was taken out of the gymnasium on a stretcher, He was declared brain dead on Wednesday.
Choi's death revived memories of a 1982 title bout in Las Vegas between lightweight champion Ray Boom Boom Mancini of the United States and South Korean Kim Duk-koo, who died from injuries sustained in the fight.
Late goals from Ernesto Chevanton and Frederic Kanoute gave holders Sevilla a place in the last 16 of the King's Cup on Wednesday with a 4-3 win over third division Denia.
The Andalucians, who were held 1-1 in the first leg, looked to be departing the Cup after they surrendered a two-goal lead to trail 3-2 against their modest opponents with eight minutes left on the clock.
But an 88th minute strike from Chevanton and a stoppage time penalty from Kanoute earned last season's UEFA Cup winners a place in the next round.
League leaders Real Madrid also left it late to seal their place in the next round, a superbly taken strike by midfielder Guti earning the Spanish champions a 2-1 win at home to third division Alicante.
Real, who scrambled a 1-1 draw in last month's first leg, took the lead when Dutch winger Arjen Robben cracked home on the half-volley to score his first goal for the club.
An ambitious Alicante refused to wilt, however, and equalised 20 minutes into the second half when striker Borja steered a near-post header low past keeper Jerzy Dudek.
With seconds of stoppage time left on the clock, the game looked certain to be heading for extra time but Guti took advantage as the Alicante defence dropped their guard and dinked a perfectly measured shot over the keeper and into the net.
Arch-rivals Barcelona went through despite being held to a 2-2 draw by third division Alcoyano at the Nou Camp.
Barca, who held a comfortable 3-0 advantage after the first leg, put the result of the tie beyond doubt when reserve forward Santiago Ezquerro struck twice in the first 11 minutes.
But a penalty from Perona and a last-minute goal from Arnau earned their modest opponents a rare draw at the Barca stadium.
Last year's losing finalists Getafe cruised into the last 16 after a 4-1 win at home to Burgos earned them an emphatic 5-1 victory on aggregate over their third division opponents. 
Real Mallorca scored four goals in 30 minutes to wipe out a two-goal first-leg deficit and turn the tables on fellow Primera Liga side Osasuna with a 4-0 win at Son Moix.
An extra-time strike from Raul Tamudo gave 2006 winners Espanyol a 3-2 aggregate win over Deportivo Coruna, while Valladolid edged a 4-3 aggregate victory over Real Murcia in the remaining all-first division clash.
Atletico Madrid, Villarreal, Valencia, Recreativo Huelva, Racing Santander, Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao all managed to see off opposition from the lower divisions.
The controversial Dakar rally gets underway on Saturday for its 30th edition with security and safety issues once again priority for organisers.
The first two stages will be held in Portugal before taking in Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal - Mali was excluded for security reasons.
In April two stages that were supposed to take place in the western African country were cancelled following recommendations from the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry.
There is still a certain amount of instability in this region and we feel it's very important to race in total security, said Etienne Lavigne, the French director of the event.
Mali's absence bodes well for Mauritania which will host a rest day on January 13 at its capital Nouackchott.
However Mauritania is not without its risks either.
Organisers only gave the green light last week to proceed as planned through the African state despite security fears prompted by recent Al-Qaeda linked attacks.
Mauritania has announced that it would mobilise 2,000 soldiers and 2,000 plainclothes police to monitor the rally as it passes through the country between January 11 and January 19.
We are going ahead with the Mauritanian stages of the rally.
It now seems that the security situation is back on track, Lavigne told AFP.
There is nothing to fear, every precaution has been put in place, added Interior Minister Yall Zakaria.
Zakaria said he told the rally inspectors that all necessary measures have been taken by the government to ensure that the event's passage through Mauritania takes place in the best possible conditions.
But whatever safety precautions are taken by officials the rally's death toll steadimph and win his third title in four years in the bike category.
However Peterhansel and Despres will have stiff competition which includes former two-time world rally champion Carlos Sainz and 2006 bike winner Marc Coma.
Spaniard Coma crashed out of last year's Dakar which he had dominated up to that moment.
will be looking to make amends for that error while compatriot Sainz admitted that he was confident it would be a case of third-time lucky in the Dakar Rally.
The 45-year-old believes that the stages in Mauritania - from January 11-19 - hold the key to a Dakar triumph.
Victory will be played out during these stages, said Sainz, who will be behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Touareg.
It's all to play for, said Sainz, who conceded that he has less experience than Peterhansel, winner last year for Mistubishi.
Sainz, the world rally champion in 1990 and 1992, won five stages of last year's Dakar Rally, but finished ninth after mechanical problems.
For me the important thing isn't winning stages but winning the Dakar, that's why I've been preparing for this all year, the Spaniard added.
The 2008 edition of the rally will set a benchmark for the number of vehicles registered with around 272 motorbikes, 214 cars, 102 trucks and 20 quads, with around 50 nationalities represented.
The Detroit Pistons turned in another dominating performance with a 106-93 win over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday, their 10th victory in a row.
Detroit held a comfortable lead for the entire second half and had seven players in double figures to extend their longest winning streak since an 11-game run two years ago.
Whenever you get in a situation like we're in now, it's because you take it one game at a time, Detroit coach Flip Saunders told reporters.
We've been on some runs, so it's not like they are uncommon.
The Pistons, who have an average recent victory margin of 16.8 points, were never threatened by the Wizards, who have not beaten a team with a winning record in over a month.
The first quarter I thought went pretty well and we didn't do much after that, Washington coach Eddie Jordan said.
There was probably one skirmish there where we played pretty well, got the lead down, but it was disappointing how we responded to one of the best teams in the league.
Detroit used a late 10-0 surge to take a 57-47 lead at the half and did not allow the Wizards to get any closer, shooting 49 percent from the field and making 11 of 22 three-point attempts.
Richard Hamilton led the Pistons in scoring for the sixth straight game with 20 points, moving him up to 10th place on the franchise scoring list.
He also had nine assists and seven rebounds.
Chauncey Billups and Rasheed Wallace added 16 points each for Detroit, and Jason Maxiell contributed 15 points off the bench.
Caron Butler had 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists for the Wizards, while Antawn Jamison had 21.
The Boston Celtics beat the Houston Rockets 97-93, winning their seventh straight game and improving to 27-3.
The Dallas Mavericks beat the Golden State Warriors for the second time this season as Dirk Nowitzki had 29 points, eight rebounds and six assists in a 121-99 win.
Golden State stunned Dallas in last year's playoffs.
LeBron James scored 36 points, 32 in the second half, as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Atlanta Hawks 98-94.
The Milwaukee Bucks snapped a four-game losing streak with a 103-98 win over the Miami Heat.
The New Jersey Nets snapped the Orlando Magic's four-game winning streak, rallying for a 96-95 win.
The Chicago Bulls won for the third time in four games under interim coach Jim Boylan, downing the Charlotte Bobcats 109-97.
The New York Knicks lost their fifth straight game, going down 107-97 to the Sacramento Kings for whom John Salmons scored a career-high 32 points.
An injury-time goal from Real Zaragoza striker Sergio Garcia earned his side a heart-stopping 3-2 aggregate victory at home to third division Pontevedra in the King's Cup on Thursday.
Zaragoza, who lost the first leg 1-0, looked to be heading out of the Cup when striker Igor de Souza put Pontevedra ahead from the penalty spot in the 18th minute.
Needing to score three goals to make it through to the next round, Zaragoza piled forward into attack, but did not manage to level the game until Diego Milito scored from the spot eight minutes into the second half.
They were given further hope when Ricardo Oliveira lashed home with 17 minutes to go, but Pontevedra looked as though they would hold out and win through on the away goals rule until Garcia headed home a rebound deep into stoppage time to make it 3-1 on the night.
Zaragoza's win was soured by the last-minute sending off of Milito who will miss Sunday's league match against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.
Victor Fernandez's side will be joined in the next round by 15 other Primera Liga sides including basement outfit Levante who claimed an equally dramatic victory over Almeria in Thursday's other tie.
Trailing 2-1 after the first leg, Almeria looked to have secured a place in the last 16 when Ruben Pulido headed in from a corner three minutes into added time.
But Levante defender Alvaro cut short the home side's celebrations when he drilled home from the edge of the area with the last kick of the game to earn his side a 1-1 draw on the
night and a 3-2 win on aggregate Holders Sevilla, last season's losing finalists Getafe, Real Madrid and Barcelona were among the sides to secure their places in the last 16 on Wednesday.
Britain's Andy Murray overcame a sluggish start before sweeping past Sweden's Thomas Johansson to claim a place in the semi-finals of the $1.5 million Qatar Open on Thursday.
Third seed Murray, who will meet either top seed Nikolay Davydenko or eighth seed Dmitry Tursunov in the last four on Friday, beat the former Australian Open champion.
In the other semi-final, defending champion Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia will meet Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka.
Fourth seed Ljubicic overcame a spirited challenge from sixth-seeded Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany in two hours and 16 minutes, while Wawrinka ended the run of Argentine Agustin Calleri in just over an hour.
The 20-year-old Murray, who lost the opening set to Rainer Schuettler on Wednesday, had another slow start against the Swede, who won the Melbourne Park grand slam event in 2002.
Johansson, who won the only previous meeting between the two at Queen's Club in 2005, matched Murray from the baseline in the opening set.
The Swede saved break points on his serve in two games before forcing the tie-break, but the Scot reeled off three points from 4-4 to wrap up the opener before speeding through the second to win in an hour and 28 minutes.
He served really well in the opening set.
Obviously, he won a high percentage of points on his first serve.
I expected it to be tough and it was that way, Murray told reporters after the match.
I was more aggressive in the second set.
I was also more confident.
When he served I was aggressive in my returns.
After that early break, I had the momentum and I saw his head go down, he added.
The Chennai Open is proving to be graveyard for seeded players as fifth seeded Nicolas Mahut of France and eighth seeded Werner Eschauer crashed out of the championship.
Nothing went right for Mahut, who went down to Croat Marin Cilic 6-2, 6-4 in 76 minutes.
Cilic awaits the winner of unseeded Robin Haase Netherland versus qualifier Lovro Zovko scheduled for later Thursday night in the quarterfinal.
Haase had put paid to the aspirations of second seeded Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 6-3, 6-4 in the first round.
In a gruelling 152 minutes encounter, Spaniard Guillermo Garcia Lopez came from behind to scalp Eschauer at to progress to the quarterfinals where he meets compatriot and top seed Rafel Nadal who defeated Indian-American Rajeev Ram in 65 minutes.
In the 13-year tournament history, seven out of eight seeds bit the dust in the 2001 event and in 2005 six seeded stars excepting the top seeds, Carlos Moya and Paradorn Srichaphan were ousted.
This year, five seeds were sent packing home by unseeded players.
I had some troubles early in the second set but I adjusted my game to break Mahut in the fifth game.
Mahut was playing at his best but for me a victory is a victory and it does not matter whether it was an easy or a tough match.
Cilic had qualified for six ATP tour events last season and had twice beaten Nikolay Davydenko, a top ten player.
China's Zhang Yining, the reigning Olympic champion, has qualified for the Beijing Games despite losing her number one table tennis ranking for the first time in five years.
The top five women in the rankings released on Thursday by the sport's ruling body were all Chinese and so were the top four men, but only the top two gain automatic qualification.
Guo Yue, the 19-year-old new number one, is the other automatic Chinese qualifier in the women's singles.
Wang Hao and Ma Lin qualify directly from the men's rankings, meaning Wang Liqin, the reigning world champion, must try to take the third and last Chinese spot at the Olympics via the Asian qualifying event.
The surprise men's singles gold medallist from the 2004 Games, Ryu Seung Min of South Korea, has qualified, ranked eighth in the world.
Timo Boll of Germany is the highest-ranked non-Chinese player at five.
The top 20 in January's rankings automatically qualify for the Beijing Games in August.
Because of the large number of Chinese in the rankings, Zoran Primorac of Croatia, ranked 23rd, has qualified for his sixth Games.
Two other players who have competed in every Games since table tennis was introduced to the Olympics in 1988, Sweden's Joergen Persson and Belgium's Jean-Michel Saive, are tied in the
final qualification position in the men's singles, They will stage a play-off for automatic qualification before the European qualifying tournament in April.
Lens' Ivory Coast international Kanga Akale has been loaned to French League rivals Marseille, both clubs confirmed on their website on Thursday.
According to a statement on the Mediterranean club's website Akale will soon be at Marseille for a medical, prior to signing.
The statement added: Of course, he will not be available for selection for Saturday's French Cup away tie at Beauvais.
Jose Anigo, Marseille's sporting director, also confirmed that the club's winter spending spree will effectively be over if Akale's deal goes through.
Once Akale passes his medical he will be loaned out for six months with the option to buy for an additional two years.
The 26-year-old striker arrived at Lens at the start of the season from Auxerre.
Lens are currently struggling this season in the relegation zone with 20 points from 18 games while Marseille have trouble finding their stride and are 11th in the league 14 points off leaders Lyon.
France has warned organisers of the Dakar rally against holding stages in Mauritania after four French tourists were killed there last month, government spokesman Laurent Wauquiez said on Thursday.
Three attackers, who authorities suspect are linked to al Qaeda, gunned down four French tourists and injured a fifth as they enjoyed a Christmas Eve picnic by the roadside in the south of the country, near the border with Senegal.
Gunmen killed three soldiers three days later in the remote and sparsely populated north of the country, bordering Algeria and Morocco's breakaway territory of Western Sahara.
France has since advised its citizens not to travel to Mauritania because the terrorist risk cannot be ruled out.
The Dakar, founded by the late Frenchman Thierry Sabine and organised by Amaury Sport Organisation, starts in Portugal on Saturday and is due to arrive in Mauritania on Jan. 11. Many of the competitors are French.
The organisers of the rally were informed of the risk assessment during a meeting at the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs, government spokesman Laurent Wauquiez told a news conference.
The ministry strongly advises all French people against travelling to Mauritania until further notice.
That goes for all French people, as well as for the organisation of the Lisbon-Dakar rally, he added.
Organisers said in a statement on the Dakar Web site that they would be contacting the authorities for further information.
The organisers of the Dakar have taken into account the declarations of the French government recommending French citizens not to go to Mauritania on the occasion of the rally, they said.
In order to comprehend the situation, they will contact the French and Mauritanian governing authorities to get information on new elements that might have motivated this communication despite the insurances given the Mauritanian government.
Last month's separate attacks have shaken the peaceful West African country as it prepares to host part of the rally, which gives an annual boost to its nascent tourism industry.
A promise of 3,000 security personnel to ensure safe passage was enough for the rally's security chief, who has given the green light to its Mauritanian stages.
Stages originally due to be held last year in neighbouring Mali were cancelled after French security services cited a threat from Algerian rebels.
The French government can only reiterate, with the greatest firmness, the advice given to travellers by the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs, Wauquiez said.
Ronaldinho, who came under fire after a poor performance in the recent 1-0 defeat against Real Madrid, also missed out on his side's King's Cup match against Alcoyano in midweek.
Striker Thierry Henry, who has not played since Nov. 24, is available after recovering from headaches that prevented him from training earlier in the week.
Real Zaragoza's leading striker Diego Milito will be able to play against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu after the Federation's Disciplinary Committee overturned his red card in the King's Cup victory over third division Pontevedra on Thursday.
Milito has scored nine league goals this season, although Zaragoza his team are currently on a seven-match winless streak.
Real Madrid winger Arjen Robben is hoping that scoring his first goal for the club since making his 36 million euro move from Chelsea will help him claim a regular place in the starting line-up after missing much of the first part of the season because of injury.
I feel in good shape after recovering from my last injury and I'm ready to play more, the Dutchman told sports daily AS after scoring in the Cup win over Alicante.
I need to play more and more and that's the only way I will become the sort of player I was before.
Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido said Wednesday's scare in the King's Cup against third division Denia gave his team the perfect wake-up call before Sunday's city derby against Real Betis.
The lesson in humility that Denia gave us showed us that we will have to play from the first minute to the last on Sunday, said Del Nido.
Sevilla surrendered a 2-0 lead to trail 3-2 against Denia and needed an 88th-minute strike from Ernesto Chevanton and a stoppage time penalty from Frederic Kanoute to reach the last 16.
Betis have not beaten Sevilla in the league at the Sanchez Pizjuan for 11 years.
Villarreal's striker Nihat Kahveci will miss his side's league clash against fellow high fliers Espanyol because of a muscle tear in his right leg.
Scottish champions Celtic signed Germany defender Andreas Hinkel from Sevilla for an undisclosed fee on Friday.
I am delighted to sign for Celtic and am really looking forward to joining up with my new team mates, the 25-year-old Hinkel told the club's official Web site.
Having already played against Celtic in European competition I am well aware of the magnificent stadium and wonderfully passionate support which the club enjoys.
Hinkel, who has signed a three and a half year deal with Celtic, has played 17 times for his country but failed to establish himself in Spain after joining Sevilla from VfB Stuttgart in 2006.
Celtic cannot use Hinkel in next month's Champions League clash against Barcelona because he has already appeared twice in this season's competition.
Manager Gordon Strachan said he had been tracking the defender for some time.
We are sure he has all the qualities to be a great success, said Strachan.
World number two Rafael Nadal saved four match points to defeat Spanish compatriot Carlos Moya and reach the Chennai Open final on Saturday.
The 21-year-old French Open champion won 6-7 7-6 7-6 after former world number one Moya pushed him to the brink in a thrilling contest between two friends.
Nadal staved off four match points in the second set tiebreak and then rallied from a break down in the decider against the 31-year-old Moya, third seed and ranked 17 in the world.
He eventually clinched the final tiebreak 7-1 to end the marathon contest lasting almost four hours.
In Sunday's final, Nadal will continue his build up for this month's Australian Open when he faces Russian fourth seed Mikhail Youzhny, who brushed aside Croatian Marin Cilic 6-2 6-3 in the first semi-final.
It was one of the most emotional matches of my career, a relieved Nadal told reporters.
It was unbelievable.
It is great to get off to such a start.
It is very good to play in the final at the start of the season.
A dejected Moya said: I had many chances to win.
Against Nadal if you don't take advantage of them, you will lose.
Moya, winner in Chennai in 2004 and 2005, played inspired tennis as he was vociferously backed by an adoring crowd.
He troubled his fellow Mallorcan with deceptive shots, often pinning Nadal to his backhand with deep returns and clever net play.
Nadal, knocked out in the semi-finals last year, began well but Moya bounced back from a break down and saved two set points before clinching the first set tiebreak 7-3.
In the second set, Nadal broke Moya's serve to go 3-2 up and was serving for the set when the former French Open champion broke back in the 10th game to force the tiebreak.
Moya raced to a 6-3 lead to almost clinch the issue but Nadal produced a series of stunning rallies to frustrate Moya on the match points.
Nadal eventually closed the tiebreak 10-8, pumping his fists in celebration.
In the decider, Moya continued to play high quality shots and broke serve in the fifth game but was tiring and the persevering Nadal grabbed his chance to break back in the 10th game.
He then raced through the tiebreak 7-1, falling to the ground in relief and joy after Moya's return sailed long.
Briton Andy Murray enjoyed the perfect start to his season when he tamed Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka 6-4 4-6 6-2 to win the Qatar Open trophy on Saturday.
Third seed Murray captured the fourth title of his career after edging out Wawrinka with his more aggressive baseline tactics in a error-riddled contest.
The result handed Murray a timely boost ahead of the Australian Open which starts on Jan. 14.
It has been a really good week for me.
I had never won a tournament in the first week of the season.
It is great going into the Australian Open, Murray, who beat the Swiss for the first time in three meetings, told reporters.
Today the quality of tennis was high.
To start with I was nervous and I was not confident hitting the ball.
In the final set I played aggressive tennis.
Wawrinka set the tone for the match when he dropped his serve in the opening game In total, the first set featured five breaks before the 20-year-old Murray bagged the set.
Murray looked to be on course for a straight sets win but lost his focus following a controversial call and allowed the unseeded Wawrinka to draw level.
Following an early exchange of breaks in the decider, Wawrinka faded to hand Murray victory.
Despite the loss, Wawrinka was delighted to have reached the final after falling in the first round in his three previous appearances.
He has been playing well last year and this year he is looking better, said the 22-year-old Wawrinka.
Overall I am happy with the week, having reached the final.
I am focused on reaching the top 20 this year.
Murray took home $171,000 while Wawrinka got $92,400.
Goals from centre back Rafael Marquez and striker Samuel Eto'o gave Barcelona their third away win of the season when they beat Real Mallorca 2-0 in the Primera Liga on Saturday.
In the showdown of the third and fourth-placed teams, Espanyol won 3-0 at home to Villarreal to extend their unbeaten run to 14 matches.
Striker Raul Tamudo opened the scoring on nine minutes with a low shot.
Midfielder Valdo flicked in the second after Luis Garcia had hit the bar before Tamudo took his tally for the season to 10 by heading home a 36th-minute corner.
Real Madrid, who host an out-of-sorts Real Zaragoza on Sunday, lead the table on 41 points.
Barca are four points behind, one ahead of Espanyol and five in front of Villarreal.
Barca went into their game under heavy pressure, having lost 1-0 at home to arch-rivals Real Madrid in the final match of last year, and made a sluggish start against the islanders who were sharper for much of the first period.
Mallorca striker Daniel Guiza gave the visitors an early scare when he sent a shot skidding past the post while midfielder Angelos Basinas lashed the ball wide midway through the half.
The hosts continued to look dangerous at the start of the second period but Barca snatched the lead after 63 minutes when Marquez took advantage of slack marking to head a corner past keeper German Lux.
Substitute Thierry Henry, making his first appearance in over a month, went close to extending the lead before Eto'o sealed the win two minutes into added time.
The former Mallorca player blasted home a powerful long-range effort after good work by Bojan Krkic on the left.
Mallorca made it very difficult but it was an important win for us, Barca coach Frank Rijkaard told reporters.
In-form Ligue 1 side Caen fell prey to knockout specialists Sedan in the last 64 round of the French Cup on Saturday.
The second division team, who reached the final in 1999 and 2005, dominated the game throughout.
They opened the scoring in the 22nd minute, went 2-0 up on the half-hour and were leading 3-1 when Caen, who ended the first half of the Ligue 1 season in fourth place, scored their second two minutes from time.
Three other Ligue 1 clubs survived scares against lower division opposition.
Le Mans needed extra time to overcome amateur fifth division side Selongey, drawn from a town of 2,500 inhabitants in eastern France, who were level at 1-1 after 90 minutes but finally bowed out 3-2 after extra time.
Strasbourg only defeated amateur side Rouen 5-4 on a penalty shoot out, while Nice struggled until the 100th minute before sealing a 2-1 victory over Ligue 2 side Le Havre.
The only two all-Ligue 1 ties were won by both the home teams with AJ Auxerre defeating Saint-Etienne 3-2 after extra time and Lorient edging Valenciennes 2-1.
Olympique Marseille captain Lorik Cana and striker Djibril Cisse scored for their side in the 2-0 win over third division Beauvis, while Paris St Germain's Clement Chantome and Sylvain Armand put their side through with a 2-0 victory over fourth division Epinal.
The round of 64, when top flight sides enter the French Cup, continues on Sunday with Olympique Lyon launching their campaign at third-division Creteil and holders Sochaux playing away at sixth division Maubeuge.
Valencia have agreed to sign Argentine midfielder Ever Banega on a five and a half year deal from Boca Juniors, the Primera Liga team said on Saturday.
Boca announced on Thursday they had agreed to sell the highly-rated 19-year-old to Valencia for a fee of 18 million euros.
Banega, who had a medical on Saturday, is expected to fill the gap left by former Valencia captain David Albelda and out-of-favour Portugal international Manuel Fernandes.
Coach Ronald Koeman has told Albelda he will not play for the club again this season while Fernandes, dropped this week after being involved in an incident at a local nightclub, is expected to leave this month.
Valencia, without a win in five league matches, are seventh in the table.
Frenchman Michael Llodra won his second ATP Tour title on Sunday when he outplayed third seed Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 6-3 6-4 to win the Adelaide International.
Llodra, who only entered the main draw after his countryman Richard Gasquet pulled out on the eve of the event through injury, served and volleyed his way to victory in 76 minutes.
I came here 10 times and I lost my first final here, Llodra said in a courtside interview.
So it's great to win here Jarkko is a fantastic player, even if he didn't win today.
It has been a great week, and it's nice to play in such great weather.
It's terrible in Paris right now, so it's really nice to play here.
The title was the first for world number 93 Llodra since he won his maiden Tour event in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands, in 2004.
Llodra, who did not lose his serve all week, raced out to a perfect start, breaking Nieminen in the second game on his way to a 3-0 lead.
The world number 27 Finn, who has now lost eight of his nine career finals, made little impression on Llodra's serve as the Frenchman took the first set in 34 minutes.
Another early break in the second set put Llodra in full command and he held his nerve to serve out for victory, clinching the title with a winning volley.
I'd like to congratulate Michael, Nieminen said.
He had a great week and really deserves to be the champion.
I had a great week not perfect, but still great.
It was really great to start the year like this.
China's former world championship bronze medallist Sun Yingjie, who is returning from a two-year doping ban, believes she may still be able to make August's Beijing Olympics.
The 28-year-old, who tested positive for the banned steroid androsterone at China's National Games in 2005, was 10th in the Xiamen International marathon on Saturday, her first outing since returning from suspension.
It was a good training for me to prepare for Olympic qualification, she told Monday's China Youth Daily.
I'm not sure but I will do my best.
Now I need to come back gradually.
If I can return to my best, I think I can take part in the Olympics.
I was really excited about taking part in this race because I had been away from a competitive atmosphere for such a long time, she added.
The four-times winner of the Beijing marathon is unlikely to qualify for the longest Olympic event but could still make the grade for the 10,000 or 5,000 metres.
Despite China's avowed determination to stamp out doping, the return of Sun is good news for a country which has few world-class track athletes and was unable to enter a single women in the 5,000 or 10,000 metres at last year's world championships.
Sun won the last of her four consecutive Beijing marathon titles on Oct.16, 2005 and the next day finished second in the 10,000 metres at the National Games in Nanjing.
One of her fellow athletes subsequently admitted to spiking Sun's drink to help her out. Although a local court cleared her of doping, the Chinese Olympic Committee handed her a statutory two-year ban.
Former world number one Gustavo Kuerten will make 2008 his personal farewell tour, stopping off at the tournaments he holds most dear, the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper said on Sunday.
The 31-year-old, who has seen his ranking collapse to 680 after three injury-ravaged years, hopes to crown his 12-year professional career with an emotional return to Roland Garros where he won three French Open titles.
I have a 99-percent chance of playing at Roland Garros this year, said Kuerten who would need a wildcard to take part in a tournament he won in 1997, 2000 and 2001.
I love Roland Garros.
It's where I have had the best performances of my career.
Kuerten will kick off his season on home ground in the Brazil Open on February 11 and then take part in the Miami Masters from March 27 before returning to Brazil for the Santa Catarina Open at Florianopolis from April 23.
He also wants to play the claycourt event in Stuttgart from July 7 in honour of his family who are of German origin.
I hope also to play in the Davis Cup.
I feel that I'm fit and if I am called-up, I will go.
Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's future with the Premier League leaders is set to be decided within days, according to Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.
The temperamental German international made the most of a rare start in a season where he has spent much of the time behind Manuel Almunia to keep a clean sheet as Arsenal advanced into the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 2-0 win away to Championship side Burnley.
Lehmann has been linked with a transfer window return to Germany with Borussia Dortmund and his current manager admitted he was still uncertain over the veteran's future with the north London giants.
Wenger said: Lehmann gave a faultless performance and he performed in a 100 percent professional way.
Will he leave? My wish is that he stays, but we will know the outcome in the next few days.
The Frenchman added his side were given a scare by Burnley after goals from Eduardo and Nicklas Bendtner at Turf Moor secured Arsenal's place in Monday's fourth round draw.
Burnley, struggling to climb from their mid-table status in the second tier, gave Arsenal a severe test of their ability even after the 60th minute dismissal of midfielder Kyle Lafferty.
And Wenger conceded Burnley's performance was a surprise that could have turned out much worse for the 10-times FA Cup winners.
Burnley played well and they had a big moment when they missed early chance with the header that hit the bar, said the Gunners boss.
It would have played a big part in the game if it had gone in because, at 1-0 down against Burnley in the manner that they played, it would have been difficult for us.
Even when we took our chance, Burnley pushed again and we missed another chance, but they deserve credit for the way that they played.
They gave everything, they played at a high pace and they played in a fair way.
I'm surprised that they are where they are in the Championship.
That division must be a tough league and I think we are much better off in the Premier League!
But it was a good test for the young players.
What surprised me was the way that Burnley threw players forward and really tried to take the game to us.
I have a squad and I am not scared to use it, though, even in the Premiership.
At Everton last week, I used Eduardo and Bendtner, but we also had Toure, Lehmann and Eboue here.
They are all top Premiership players, so there would have been no excuses.
Defeat leaves Burnley to concentrate solely on securing a play-off spot in the Championship, but manager Owen Coyle admitted he was heartened by Wenger's praise for his team.
Arsene Wenger came up to me after the game and he said that 'We got lucky,' so I take that as a compliment.
There is no doubting Arsenal's quality, but we missed a big chance early in the game and, once we had Kyle sent off, ten men against Arsenal's eleven was always going to be very difficult.
LeBron James scored a team record 24 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter to lead a Cleveland Cavaliers rally for a 93-90 road victory over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday.
I just felt like I was out there by myself like in practice, James told reporters.
James connected on eight of 10 field-goal attempts in the quarter as the Cavaliers rallied from a 70-57 deficit after three quarters, outscoring the Raptors 36-20.
LeBron in the fourth quarter was amazing, Cavaliers coach Mike Brown told reporters.
James hit three three-pointers in the quarter, including back-to-back shots that took Cleveland from an 80-78 deficit to an 84-80 advantage with 3:21 to play.
His running jump shot gave the Cavaliers the lead for good at 86-84 after Toronto had tied the score with 2:09 to go.
I was able to control the tempo in the fourth quarter with my penetration, getting into the lane and kicking out for threes, James added.
He had made only six of 19 shots in the first three quarters.
Chris Bosh scored 23 points for the Raptors who led by 20 points in the second quarter.
The Cleveland comeback was the largest ever by a Raptors opponent in Toronto.
Pau Gasol's 28 points and 13 rebounds led the Memphis Grizzlies to a 101-94 home win over the Miami Heat, who lost for the seventh consecutive game.
Tony Parker scored 26 points and Tim Duncan contributed 17 points and 17 rebounds in the San Antonio Spurs' 88-82 road win over the Los Angeles Clippers.
Manu Ginobili returned from a finger injury to add 23 points for the Spurs.
Allen Iverson's 38 points powered the Denver Nuggets to a 109-96 home victory over Iverson's former team, the Philadelphia 76ers.
Kobe Bryant had 26 points and Andrew Bynum added 23 points and 13 assists in the Los Angeles Lakers' 112-96 home win over the Indiana Pacers.
Caron Butler's 33 points led the Washington Wizards to a 108-86 rout of the Seattle SuperSonics.
England striker Jermain Defoe wants to remain at Tottenham Hotspur despite being told by manager Juande Ramos he can quit the English Premier League club.
The manager has said I can leave if I want but I want to prove him wrong, Defoe told the Sun newspaper on Tuesday.
I want to stay here.
He just said, 'You can leave if you want to'.
Yet I have no intentions of leaving this club because I love it here.
The 25-year-old Defoe, one of four top strikers at Spurs including Robbie Keane, Dimitar Berbatov and Darren Bent, has been unable to claim a regular place in the starting lineup in the last year and a half.
The former West Ham United forward said he could not sign a new, long-term contract with the club unless Ramos started playing him regularly.
How can I be expected to stay for the next few years if I am going to be on the bench all the time? , said Defoe.
I don't think any player would accept that.
Slovak international defender Martin Skrtel is set to join English Premier League side Liverpool, his agent Viktor Kolar claimed on Monday.
The transfer is imminent, Kolar told the daily newspaper Sport.
Skrtel currently plays for Russian champions Zenit Saint-Petersburg.
The newspaper reported that the 23-year-old's transfer would be in the region of 10 million euros, adding that he could be in Merseyside by the end of the week.
English Premier league side Bolton announced Monday they have rejected a bid from Chelsea for their French striker Nicolas Anelka.
Chelsea confirmed they had made a move for the 28-year-old, who signed a four-year contract with Bolton earlier this season, but insisted negotiations were ongoing and they were still hopeful of landing the player.
We can confirm we have made an official offer for the transfer of Nicolas Anelka, which is being discussed with Bolton Wanderers, read a statement on Chelsea's website.
Chelsea's bid was not disclosed but according to sources close to Bolton the club have fixed a price tag on the mercurial Frenchman at 17 millions euros.
The Londoners are eager to bring in a top-level scorer to cover for Didier Drogba who will play for the Ivory Coast in the African Nations Cup later this month and the injured Andriy Shevchenko.
And Anelka seems to fit the bill for Avram Grant's side having scored 11 goals despite his side struggling in the first half of the new campaign.
Anelka joined Bolton in 2006 but despite signing a new contract this season the forward has made his interest in joining a bigger club known.
Anelka has a reputation for not becoming too attached to clubs having also played for Manchester City, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Paris Saint Germain and Turkish club Fenerbahce during his colourful career.
The controversial striker has also had a strained relationship with several France national coaches, notably Jacques Santini and Roger Lemerre.
Premier League Portsmouth have signed teenage striker Danijel Subotic from Swiss side Basel, the club said on Monday.
The 18-year-old signed a three-and-a-half year contract with Portsmouth who will pay Basel an undisclosed fee.
He was recommended to us so we brought him over for a few days' training and he did well, Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp said on the club's Web site.
We've taken a gamble on him and hopefully he's one for the future.
We'll see how he goes.
Portsmouth have been particularly hard hit by the African Nations Cup with four first-team regulars departing for the tournament in Ghana, which starts on Jan. 20, and Redknapp is busy scouring the market.
We need to get three or four in to help during the games that the African players will miss but it's not easy to find them, he said.
Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis has replaced an ill Roger Federer in the draw at the Kooyong Classic, organisers said on Tuesday.
Federer withdrew from the eight-man invitational event on Monday with a stomach virus, though he said he expected to resume training later this week as he finalised preparations for next week's Australian Open, the season's opening grand slam.
Baghdatis lost in four sets to Federer in the 2006 Australian Open final and despite losing in the first round of the Chennai Open last week, he said making the final of the doubles with France's Marc Gicquel had at least given him some match practice.
I didn't play too well in Chennai last week though I played good in the doubles, Baghdatis told a news conference.
I had some matches okay, he added, laughing.
No, I'm feeling really good and I'm looking forward to playing some matches with the guys and having some fun and getting ready for the Open.
The tournament, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2008, guarantees players three matches against a field stacked with top-10 players before the Australian Open.
The big thing here is that you want to get through matches here against this type of field, said 2007 champion Andy Roddick.
That's great preparation for next week and that's what the main thing is.
World number four Nikolay Davydenko, who has replaced Tommy Haas in the tournament, will meet Baghdatis in Wednesday's first match and be followed by Roddick against Croatia's Ivan Ljubicic.
We have played a few times and know each other pretty well.
I think there will be a lot of long rallies, kick serves and staying back five metres behind the baseline, Ljubicic said when asked about the style of match between the two.
No, of course it will be a powerful game, the world number 19 added with a smile in reference to Roddick's booming serve.
I hope I can play well this week and when we get to Melbourne Park I will be in peak form.
Chile's Fernando Gonzalez meets Argentine David Nalbandian and Britain's Andy Murray plays Russian Marat Safin in Wednesday's other matches.
Manchester United hung on to top spot in the Premier League with late goals from Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo sealing a 2-0 victory at Reading on Saturday.
United failed to put any daylight between themselves and Arsenal, however, with Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor scoring twice as the Gunners returned to form with a 3-0 rout of Fulham at Craven Cottage.
Third-placed Chelsea rode their luck to beat Birmingham City 1-0 away thanks to Claudio Pizarro's late header.
They stay four points behind the top two who have 54 points from 23 matches.
There is a yawning gap to fourth-placed Liverpool who are facing a stiff battle for fourth spot with Everton, Aston Villa and Manchester City.
All four clubs are on 39 points.
Liverpool, who have only played 21 matches, are at Villa on Monday, while Everton travel to Wigan Athletic on Sunday when Manchester City host West Ham United.
Kevin Keegan's homecoming party went flat when Newcastle United were held 0-0 by Bolton Wanderers in a torrid encounter at St James' Park.
The stadium was rocking but in reality Bolton were very disciplined and we weren't good enough to break them down, Keegan, back for a second stint in charge, told Setanta Sport.
While the top three all won, the bottom three all lost.
Fulham are five points from safety while bottom club Derby County are 13 adrift after Portsmouth's Benjani Mwaruwari scored a hat-trick in Portsmouth's 3-1 victory.
Sunderland stay in the bottom three on goal difference after a 2-0 loss at Tottenham Hotspur, for whom Robbie Keane scored his 100th goal.
Middlesbrough drew 1-1 at Blackburn Rovers.
United, stifled by Reading in a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford on the opening day of the season, took the lead with 15 minutes remaining when Rooney produced a cool finish after an instinctive pass by Carlos Tevez.
Ronaldo, the country's top scorer, broke away in stoppage time to take his league tally to 17.
We kept making chances but you start to worry if you are going to get the goal, United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports News.
We got the goal at the right time and hung on.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was a happy man after his side outclassed Fulham.
Two textbook headers from Adebayor and a Tomas Rosicky volley underlined their superiority.
This was a very strong response to our last game and shows that this team is up for it, Wenger, whose side were held by Birmingham last week, told the BBC.
Pizarro earned Chelsea a gritty victory with his first league goal since the opening day, also against Birmingham and, despite not playing well, they are still very much in the title race.
At this stage of the season it was very important to win. 
We knew it would be a very difficult game because they drew against Arsenal last week, manager Avram Grant told the BBC.
Villarreal moved up to third spot in the Primera Liga and heaped the pressure on beleaguered Valencia when they crushed their regional rivals 3-0 at the Madrigal on Saturday.
A superbly-crafted opener from midfielder Robert Pires, a Joan Capdevila tap-in and a classy strike from the outstanding Nihat Kahveci completed an emphatic victory for home side.
For Ronaldo Koeman's Valencia, defeat meant they have now gone eight games without a win and have taken just three points from a possible 24.
Earlier, Sevilla missed their chance to climb the table when they continued their miserable run away from home, slumping to a last-gasp 3-2 defeat at Getafe.
The Andalucians, who have just one win on the road in the league, started brightly and took the lead after 16 minutes when leading striker Luis Fabiano got his 13th of the season with a close-range header.
But former Sevilla midfielder Francisco Javier Casquero put Getafe back on level terms with a fabulous first-time shot into the top corner from the edge of the area.
Getafe went in front just before the hour mark, Uruguayan midfielder Juan Albin stealing behind Sevilla fullback Ivica Dragutinovic to score with a diving header.
Dragutinovic seemed to have atoned for his error when he headed in from a corner a minute from time but the celebrations were cut short when substitute Cosmin Contra nodded home deep into stoppage time.
The win lifted Michael Laudrup's Getafe side four points clear of the relegation zone, and just two behind Sevilla who remain eighth in the standings.
Villarreal's former Arsenal player Pires said earlier this week he was concerned about his lack of form but the Frenchman put his worries behind him when he curled a superb shot inside the far post after a great run down the left.
The electric Nihat hit the woodwork twice and was denied by a great fingertip save from Timo Hildebrand before Capdevila made it 2-0 when he stabbed in after a corner.
The Turkish striker capped a brilliant performance when he chipped in over the keeper after Giuseppe Rossi had raced clear into the Valencia area.
Girondins Bordeaux moved up to second place in Ligue 1 on Saturday after a 2-1 win at Le Mans despite playing with 10 men for the entire second half.
The win put them on 39 points from 21 matches, three behind leaders Olympique Lyon who visit struggling Racing Lens on Sunday.
Third-placed Nancy, on 36, travel to sixth-placed Nice on Sunday.
Bordeaux made a perfect start, scoring two goals in 22 minutes through Argentine striker Fernando Cavenaghi and Brazilian midfielder Fernando.
Le Mans got back into the game when 22-year-old midfielder Martin Douillard scored in the 35th minute and were further boosted when Bordeaux defender Franck Jurietti was handed a straight red for slapping Douillard's face.
Le Mans lost their numerical advantage 15 minutes from time when Gregory Cerdan was sent off for bringing down Brazilian midfielder Geraldo Wendel.
Two goals by Djibril Cisse helped Olympique Marseille to a 3-1 home win over Valenciennes, who slipped to fifth in the table.
Cisse opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a well-struck shot and made it three 15 minutes from time after Julien Rodriguez headed home a Bruno Cheyrou corner in the 51st minute.
The win lifted Marseille to 10th. 
Caen moved up to fourth after a 1-1 draw at Toulouse, while an own goal by Gregory Bourillon put the brakes on Paris St Germain's recent recovery of form as they lost 1-0 at Lorient.
The 23-year-old defender deflected a cross from Rafi Saifi in the 20th minute.
PSG, who ended the first half of the season 16th in the 20-team league, just two points clear of the drop zone, were on a run of four wins in all competitions.
They recorded their first home Ligue 1 win last weekend and qualified on Wednesday for the French League Cup semi-finals.
A return to an aggressive game plan and a run of good results had helped Juan Carlos Ferrero recapture his best form in dumping David Nalbandian out of the Australian Open, the Spaniard said on Sunday.
The former world number one blasted the 10th-seed off the court 6-1 6-2 6-3 in their third round clash, capitalising on six of his 10 break opportunities, chasing down everything Nalbandian returned and producing an outstanding service game.
Right now, I'm trying to go to the court and be very aggressive all the time, be more aggressive than maybe the other guy, Ferrero told reporters after the one hour 44 minute match.
I was trying to be as aggressive as I was before when I was number one or reaching my best results that is giving me good results.
Nalbandian had suffered muscle spasms in his back the week prior to the tournament, and seemed unable to respond to anything the Spanish baseliner threw at him.
The match had been postponed from Saturday due to rain and the delay seemed to have hampered the Argentine, who followed women's second seed Svetlana Kuznetsova and sixth seed Anna Chakvetadze as third round casualties.
Ferrero added he had been particularly pleased with his serve and his ability to convert his break opportunities, though said it should not have been a surprise given his recent form.
I'm playing good tennis since, I don't know, two months, something like this, the 27-year-old said.
At the end of the last year I played good matches against top players.
I came playing well.
Ferrero made the final of the Auckland Open in New Zealand last week, losing to Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber, which he said had given him confidence coming into the season's first grand slam.
When you play matches against the top players like today, you know, you want to make your best.
I think I did it very well. 
First half goals from Raul Gonzalez and Ruud van Nistelrooy gave Spanish league leaders Real Madrid a hard-earned 2-0 derby victory at neighbours Atletico Madrid on Sunday.
The Spanish giants now have 50 points from 20 games and retained their seven-point lead over rivals Barcelona who beat Racing Santander 1-0.
It wasn't spectacular but we did what was necessary.
We had to suffer for much of the game but in the end we had a winning formula, admitted Real coach Bernd Schuster.
What made me happy was that unlike on Wednesday we made the most of our chances.
We might only have had two in the first half but we scored two goals.
It wasn't a lucky victory.
In the second half, they didn't have a good chance to score and we almost got a third.
Raul got Real off to the best possible start by finding the net after just 32 seconds, with Atletico leaving him unmarked to side foot the ball into the net from two metres after Robinho had done the hard work down the left.
Atletico immediately went on the attack to try to get back on level terms and relentlessly kept the pressure on for the next 40 minutes.
However, against the run of play, Real added a second when van Nistelrooy got his 12th goal of the season four minutes before the break.
Atletico goalkeeper Christian Abbiati succeeded in getting a hand to the left foot effort but he could only push the ball onto the post and it rebounded into the net.
Atletico now lie in fourth place, 13 points off the lead, and have not won a derby clash with Real in front of their own fans since October 1999.
Henry can thank the luckless Racing defender Cesar Navas, who badly miscued his clearance following a Deco corner, for his sixth goal of the season and his team's three points.
The Frenchman was on hand to tap the spinning ball into the net from close range after Navas' slice ended up at his feet.
Barca looked unimpressive until Lionel Messi came on after 66 minutes for his first game in a month after recovering from a torn left thigh muscle.
The Argentine winger, who was second in the voting for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year last month, immediately added a bit of pace and bite to the Barca attack although they failed to add another goal.
Goals from Robert Pires, Joan Capdevila and Nihat Kahveci helped Villarreal to an emphatic 3-0 victory over local rivals Valencia on Saturday.
The win meant Villarreal move up to third while Valencia's winless streak, which began in November, has now gone to eight league games.
Espanyol's ambitions of moving up to third virtually vanished 7.3 seconds into their game at Valladolid on Sunday, when Joseba Llorente scored the second fastest goal in Spanish first division history.
Malaga's Dario Silva holds the record of the fastest goal in La Liga when he found the net after 7.2 seconds, ironically against Valladolid, on December 10, 2000.
Llorente got another after 33 minutes, to help Valladolid on their way to a 2-1 win over the Barcelona-based side.
Espanyol's Marc Torrejon got one back for the visitors after 58 minutes but they couldn't find an equaliser and remain fifth while Valladolid, after their fourth successive win, climb to seventh.

Swedish tennis player Joachim Johansson, who once reached number nine in the world, announced his retirement on Friday at the age of 25 because of a long-standing shoulder injury.
I can practice for a few weeks and play an individual tournament but after that my shoulder gets overworked forcing me to rest for a longer period of time, said the Swede who has been dogged by injury for three years.
Taking that into account it is hard for me to reach my objectives and for that reason it makes it impossible for me to continue my challenge.
Johansson's shoulder problems started at the beginning of 2005 season, with 
the first of his three surgeries performed in July, 2005.
The 6ft 6in right-hander won three career singles titles and reached the semi-finals of the 2004 US Open, when he beat defending champion Andy Roddick before falling to Lleyton Hewitt.
The following year at the Australian Open, Johansson hit an ATP co-record of 51 aces in his four-set loss to Andre Agassi in the fourth round.
Americans Kevin Sutherland and Charles Warren remained atop the leaderboard here Friday after the completion of the darkness-halted first round of the six million-dollar US PGA FBR Open.

Ten-man Werder Bremen allowed Bayern Munich to open a three-point gap at the top of the Bundesliga after they were humbled 2-1 at struggling VfL Bochum on Sunday.
Bremen's Danish striker Daniel Jensen put the hosts ahead just before half-time, but Bochum fought back and equalised when forward Benjamin Auer's right-footed shot beat goalkeeper Tim Weise on 68 minutes.
Werder's Brazilian international defender Naldo was dismissed when he was shown a straight red card with twenty minutes left after a bad tackle on Bochum striker Stanislav Sestak.
And Bochum's Algerian international defender Anthar Yahia gave his side victory with a header on 84 minutes to put his side 11th in the league.
The result keeps Bremen second while Schalke 04 are up to fifth after their comfortable 4-1 win over VfB Stuttgart with Kevin Kuranyi and Heiko Westermann celebrating their call-ups for Germany's friendly against Austria next week with goals.
Kuranyi headed Schalke into a 32nd minute lead and made it 2-0 with a shot on 52 minutes, before picking up a yellow card as Stuttgart midfielder Antonio da Silva levelled the scores with a free-kick on 61 minutes.
But uncapped Westermann, who is expected to make his debut in Vienna on Wednesday, put his side into a 3-1 lead with a header on 76 minutes before Brazilian midfielder Ze Roberto scored on his debut with a goal in the 92nd minute.
On Saturday, Hamburg slipped back to fourth in the table as Bayer Leverkusen claimed third spot with late 3-2 win at Energie Cottbus with German striker Simon Rolfes converting a late penalty.
Bayern had to survive a fightback in Rostock on Friday before the German giants came away with a 2-1 win.
Bayern cruised into a 2-0 half-time lead courtesy of goals from Franck Ribery and Luca Toni.
But coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's side made a nervous start to the second-half as their defence leaked an early goal by Rostock's Enrico Kern.
A penalty by Hanover's Hungarian midfielder Szabolcs Huszti just before half-time gave his side the lead in Hamburg before Croatian striker Ivica Olic bagged his eighth league goal of the season as Hanover had Sergio Pinto dismissed late in the game.

Nuremberg stay in the bottom three after their 2-0 defeat at Karlsruhe, who are sixth.
Hertha Berlin were humbled 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt as their 20-year-old Czech international striker Martin Fenin enjoyed a dream debut which leaves both sides in mid-table.
And Arminia Bielefeld were beaten 1-0 at home to VfL Wolfsburg to hang just above the relegation zone.
Veteran striker Alessandro Del Piero and in-form striker Antonio Cassano were the surprise ommissions from coach Roberto Donadoni's 20-man squad to face Portugal in a friendly in Zurich, Switzerland on Wednesday.
Del Piero has been in fine form for Juventus this season but he did not make the cut for the reduced squad for a Euro 2008 warm-up.
Cassano's fans have been clamouring for him to be included again, after more than a year in the international wilderness, but despite his goal-scoring feats at Sampdoria this season, he too failed to earn a call-up.
Ten-man Ghana came from behind to beat arch-rivals Nigeria 2-1 in the African Nations Cup quarter-finals on Sunday while Ivory Coast scored four times in the last 20 minutes to thump Guinea 5-0.
As the tournament continued to throw up goals and drama in equal measure, Junior Agogo scored an 82nd-minute winner for the hosts to stun the disappointing Super Eagles.
Salomon Kalou scored twice and his Chelsea team mate Didier Drogba also hit the target for Ivory Coast after they had toiled for 70 minutes against Guinea.
Ghana will face Cameroon or Tunisia in Thursday's semi-final in Accra while Ivory Coast will play Egypt or Angola in Kumasi.
Ghana's win sent thousands of fans out onto the streets of Accra to celebrate, some carrying replica coffins covered in the green and white of Nigeria.
It's a fantastic team effort, they are really 11 heroes, said Ghana coach Claude Le Roy, who criticised the second-half sending off of defender John Mensah for a professional foul on Peter Odemwingie.
John did not make a single mistake in the game and I have seen players not sent off for professional fouls much worse than that, he said.
Nigeria coach Berti Vogts, whose team managed only three goals and failed to reach the last four for the first time in five Nations Cup tournaments, said: We made one or two mistakes and that is not allowed in international football.
Yakubu Aiyegbeni and Ike Uche wasted good early changes for Nigeria while Ghana's Asamoah Gyan blasted a powerful drive against the post after a stunning piece of control.
Nigeria went ahead in the 35th minute when Yakubu was pulled down by Eric Addo with a rugby-style tackle.
He took the penalty himself and made no mistake as he scored into the bottom left-hand corner.
Michael Essien headed Ghana level in first-half injury-time, the ball hitting the inside of the post and trickling in, but the game swung back in Nigeria's favour when Mensah was dismissed for tripping goalbound Odemwingie on the hour.
However, Nigeria never made the advantage count and with eight minutes left, Agogo, who plays for Nottingham Forest in the English third division, tapped in from close range after Sulley Muntari had squeezed a pass through the Nigeria defence.
In Sekondi, Abdelkader Keita gave Ivory Coast a 25th minute lead when he pounced on a defensive mistake to score with a shot which slipped between out-of-position goalkeeper Kemoko Camara and the near post.
The Olympique Lyon player celebrated with a double somersault and by aggressively kicking over a giant inflatable soft drinks can.
Camara, currently club-less, atoned with world class saves to deny Drogba and Aruna Dindane before halftime.
Guinea dominated the opening of the second half but capitulated after Drogba scored a clinically taken second in the 70th minute.
Kalou added two more, the first from Drogba's pass,and Bakary Kone fired in the fifth.
Aston Villa lost ground in the race for a Champions League place as they were beaten 2-1 at Fulham on Sunday.
Newcastle United scored their first goal under Kevin Keegan, but they had to settle for a point as they drew 1-1 with north-east rivals Middlesbrough.
Villa, who began the day three points behind fourth-placed Everton, looked on course for victory when Aaron Hughes scored an own goal on 69 minutes.
Simon Davies levelled for Fulham four minutes later and Jimmy Bullard curled in a superb free-kick four minutes from the end to improve Fulham's chances of avoiding relegation.
At St James's Park, Michael Owen put Newcastle ahead with a header from Emre's free-kick on the hour mark.
But Robert Huth scored a late equalizer to earn Middlesbrough a share of the points.
We never dominated but looked the most likely to create chances,Newcastle manager Keegan said.
In the last 10-15 minutes it turned into a real derby match and I think we deserved the three points.
I think Middlesbrough were fortunate with their goal, Huth was offside, but when you're in a bad run you do not get those kind of decisions.
Fifth division outfit Carquefou produced the shock of the French Cup in knocking out first division high-fliers Nancy on Sunday, while league leaders Lyon just avoided a similar fate with a narrow win over a fourth division side.
After a goalless 90 minutes at Carquefou the match came to life in extra-time when, instead of Nancy's superior fitness proving decisive, their hosts from a small town in Brittany, northwestern France, shocked them by first taking the lead, then going back in front after the professionals had levelled.
Laurent Delanoe opened the scoring after 101 minutes of hard-fought action which had seen Nancy look nothing like the side standing third in the French table and dreaming of possible participation in the Champions League next season.
They emerged from their slumber briefly when Marc-Antoine Fortune levelled inside four minutes with a fortiutous lob, just before the end of the first period of extra-time.
But if the first division side thought they had earned at least a replay Sebastien Le Paih had other ideas and netted the winner with three minutes to go at a Stade du Moulin-Bousseau packed with 3,000 fans.
It's a shock, said Carquefou coach Denis Renaud.
Nancy were being touted as a mountain to climb and we can hardly take in the fact we have beaten them.
It will take a few days to sink in.
Now we're just three matches away from the Stade de France.
Nancy coach Pablo Correa slammed his side.
I have to congratulate Carquefou.
They wanted it more than we did.
Lyon meanwhile thanked a goal ten minutes from time by Brazilian Fred as they edged out fourth division Croix de Savoie 1-0 while in the late game ten-times winners Marseille were meeting neighbours Monaco in the tie of the round.
On Saturday, Paris Saint Germain made it into the last 16 by ending the dreams of fifth division Le Poire-sur-Vie, 3-1 away, while holders Sochaux also advanced, on penalties, against Montpellier.
American JB Holmes had back-to-back birdies on the same hole just 30 minutes apart to edge Phil Mickelson in a playoff and capture his second FBR Open title in three years.
Holmes birdied the 18th hole to force a playoff then defeated Mickelson with by draining a seven-foot putt on the first hole of the playoff in the six-million dollar event.
Holmes also won this event in 2006 Asked to compare the two wins he said this one really tested his determination.
It is a little different, said Holmes, who shot a 71 Sunday to finish at 14-under 270.
I won the first time here and then everybody questioned why I couldn't win again.
This one is more redemption to prove everyone was wrong Holmes watched his seven-foot putt sail straight in then stepped forward and punched his right fist in the air.
He sank a 10-foot birdie putt on 18 in regulation to pull even with Mickelson who started the day four shots adrift of Holmes.
Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy will be unable to play for the Netherlands in next week's friendly against Croatia because of an ankle injury, the Primera Liga side said on Sunday.
Dutchman, who is Real's leading scorer with 12 goals this season, suffered a blow to his right ankle in Saturday's 2-0 defeat against Almeria.
Real said Van Nistelrooy was on crutches and would not travel to hook up with the Dutch squad who play Croatia in Split on Wednesday.
Genoa striker Marco Borriello was handed his first Italy call-up on Sunday by coach Roberto Donadoni for Wednesday's friendly against Portugal in Zurich.
The 25-year-old has scored 12 goals in Serie A this season, including the penalty that gave his side a 2-1 win over Catania on Sunday.
Donadoni upset media predictions that he would recall in-form Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero, who has not played for the world champions since his poor performance in a goalless Euro 2008 qualifier against France in September.
Antonio Cassano was also excluded from the 20-man squad, despite having shown some of the form that made him one of Italian soccer's brightest prospects since joining Sampdoria on loan from Real Madrid in the close season.
Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and defender Giorgio Chiellini, along with AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso, are unavailable because of injury.
American Levi Leipheimer launches his defence of the Tour of California title on Sunday as he and his Astana teammates try to rebound from the shock of their ban from the 2008 Tour de France.
Astana, including reigning Tour de France champion Alberto Contador, were Wednesday barred from competing in this year's race as a result of doping scandals over the past two years.
Leipheimer, who said Thursday he was shocked by the ban, vowed that he and his teammtes will continue to fight, with the eight-day California race offering a chance to show the mettle of the outfit handled by Johan Bruyneel.
The race starts with Sunday's prologue, an individual time trial in Palo Alto, California, just south of San Francisco.
It will conclude February 24 in Pasadena, just northeast of Los Angeles.
This year, the Quick Step team will include world road racing champion Paolo Bettini of Italy and Belgian Tom Boonen.
CSC's lineup includes German Jens Voigt, who was second last year, American Bobby Julich, Australian Stuart O'Grady, and world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland.
In 2007, Leipheimer, then riding for Discovery Channel, took the lead in the prologue and never relinquished it.
British fourth seed Andy Murray moved into semi-finals of the ATP tournament in Marseille following a win over Nicolas Mahut of France on Friday.
The world number 11 edged out his French opponent in just under an hour and a quarter.
The British number one will now meet another Frenchman as he awaits the winner of the clash between Gilles Simon and number eight seed Paul-Henri Mathieu.
Murray served up 14 aces, four more than his 26-year-old opponent.
The match went with serve in the first set before Mahut served to stay in the set at 5-4 before tying the match, and again at 6-5 when the Scot broke to win the set 7-5.
The 21-year-old Scot then won the ninth game to love and Mahut found himself serving to stay in the match.
Murray moved to 40-15 to claim two match points but the home favourite reeled off three points for game point before the Briton hauled him back to deuce.
However, Mahut went back ahead and levelled the game at 5-5 but Murray held serve to go 6-5 up.
A close-fought 12th game saw Mahut squander a chance to level at game point but he held his nerve to draw level at 6-6 and force a tie-break.
The Angers-born player won the first two points before Murray hit back for 4-2.
Mahut, though, hit back to level at 4-4 with his 10th ace of the game but Murray won the next two points to move to match point at 6-4.
Croatia's Mario Ancic, ranked 135th in the world but formerly a number seven, won against Robin Soderling of Sweden, by firing down 25 aces and moving into the semi-finals.
Ancic will meet the winner of the final quarter-final between sixth seed Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus and Russian third seed Mikhail Youzhny.
Chelsea captain John Terry has made a surprise early recovery from a fractured foot and is included in the squad for Saturday's FA Cup fifth round tie at home to League One Huddersfield Town.
He has surprised us all, maybe he is a bionic man, Chelsea coach Avram Grant said of the England defender on the Premier League club's Web site on Friday.
He heals very, very quickly and well and maybe he will be available for tomorrow.
We didn't decide about it yet but each injury depends on the person and he is very strong, not just mentally, also physically.
Grant believes Terry's return to the squad is a big boost at a key time ahead of Tuesday's Champions League first knockout round, first-leg tie at Olympiakos Piraeus and the League Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley on Feb. 24.
He is a very, very important player.
I have been all over the world and I have not seen a captain like him, said Grant.
He is a big influence on the team and, for me, a captain is not just about talking, it is about being an example.
We miss him a lot on the pitch.
Terry, England captain under former manager Steve McClaren, has missed the chance to impress new England manager Fabio Capello after breaking his foot against Arsenal on Dec. 16.
On Sunday, Grant said he was unlikely to be fit for the League Cup final, adding.
I think it will be too soon I think he will be back in about three weeks.
Inter Milan took another huge step closer to the Italian title after extending their lead at the top of Serie A to 11 points on Saturday.
Luca Toni scored a second-half hat-trick to give Bayern Munich a 3-0 win away to Hanover 96 on Sunday, restoring their three-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.
Bayern were struggling to make headway in heavy conditions before Toni produced a perfect strike on the turn for the opening goal in the 58th minute.
The Italian World Cup winner doubled the lead when he beat the offside trap again six minutes later and slipped a shot past Robert Enke.
Toni completed the hat-trick, and took his goals tally for the season to 13, when he headed over Enke on the rebound eight minutes from time.
Victory gave Bayern 43 points from 20 games.
Werder Bremen are second on 40 after winning 2-0 at home to Nuremberg on Saturday.
Hamburg SV moved up to third place on 37 points by winning 3-0 at home to Bochum in Sunday's other match.
Ivica Olic put them ahead five minutes before the break and a second-half double from David Jarolim made certain of Hamburg's first league win in 2008.
An own goal by Preston North End's Darren Carter four minutes into stoppage time gave Portsmouth a fortunate 1-0 away win in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Sunday.
Keeper Andy Lonergan missed Niko Kranjcar's last-ditch corner and the ball curled towards the far post where midfielder Carter kicked a desperate attempt at a clearance into the roof of the net.
England goalkeeper David James, the man of the match, saved a penalty on the hour to keep Portsmouth in the game against Preston, who are only one point above the Championship relegation zone.
James went to his right to parry Simon Whaley's spot kick after Sylvain Distin had brought down Billy Jones.
In the day's earlier match, Middlesbrough were held to a 0-0 draw at Championship side Sheffield United and will host the replay at the Riverside stadium on Feb. 26.
At Preston, the first real chance fell to Portsmouth but Lonergan tipped over Sulley Muntari's 36th-minute free kick.
However, Preston created the greater number of chances in the second half with James making a string of fine saves including a full-length dive to get to Neil Mellor's shot.
They really didn't deserve to lose that game but then that's football, Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp said.
It was a good performance from Preston.
If they played like that every week they wouldn't be in a re legation battle, would
they Of James's penalty save, he added: You're quietly confident that he's going to save it.
You wouldn't want anybody else in the goal at that time.
Sheffield United dominated a tight match at Bramall Lane in which their former England striker James Beattie hit the post with a free kick in first-half stoppage time.
Boro striker Mido had a bicycle kick tipped over by United keeper Paddy Kenny near the hour and defender Emanuel Pogatetz's header was cleared off the line at the end.
Only four Premier League sides go into Monday's quarter-final draw, holders Chelsea and last year's finalists Manchester United both having won their ties on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson held off a strong challenge from playing partner Jeff Quinney to win the Northern Trust Open by two shots at Riviera Country Club on Sunday.
The world number two, who squandered an early three-stroke cushion to trail by one after the turn, recovered to clinch his 33rd PGA Tour title with a one-under-par 70.
Mickelson, beaten by fellow American Charles Howell III in a playoff at Riviera last year, piled up three birdies and two bogeys in sun-soaked conditions for a 12-under total of 272.
Quinney, a stroke behind Mickelson overnight, had to settle for second place after rolling in a 25-footer to birdie the last for a 71.
Britain's Luke Donald birdied the final two holes for a 68 to share third place at seven under with British Open champion Padraig Harrington.
This is pretty cool, a beaming Mickelson said in a greenside television interview after triumphing for the first time at Riviera.
I have wanted to win this for such a long time.
It was a tough fight today because Jeff played so well.
He gave a few back at the end but it was a good battle.
Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara, riding for CSC, Sunday won the prologue of the 2008 Tour of California, a 3.4km individual time trial on the streets of Palo Alto.
With a time of 3min 51.211sec, the world time-trial champion was more than four seconds ahead of Briton Bradley Wiggins, with American Tyler Farrar more than five seconds back.
Levi Leipheimer, winner of the prologue and the race title last year, was fourth.
Leipheimer, who rode for Discovery Channel last season, is riding this year for Astana, and he and his teammates hope to use the California race to shake off the disappointment of being banned from this year's Tour de France over doping scandals.
Monday's stage one will take the riders 156km from Santa Rosa to Sacramento. The race concludes on February 24 in Pasadena in suburban Los Angeles.
Five players were sent off in a Bogota derby match in which Millonarios beat La Equidad 2-1 with a last minute penalty to scrape their first win of Colombia's Apertura championship season.
Millonarios' Argentine coach Mario Vanermerak is renowned for bringing out the gritty qualities in his players but it was La Equidad who collected four of the red cards in Sunday's bad-tempered game.
Millonarios were a goal down at halftime and Gerardo Bedoya's equaliser for the home side looked suspiciously offside, with referee Adalberto Rincon's indecisive stance only making matters worse.
Millonarios' full-back Fernando Monroy was the first to be sent off, followed by dismissals for La Equidad players Jerson Cordoba and Roman Torres.
Rincon then awarded Millonarios a last-minute penalty following a foul on Roberto Carlos Cortes and the ensuing row resulted in La Equidad defender Jonathan Werpajosky and goalscorer Roberto Polo being sent off.
La Equidad coach Alexis Garcia was also dismissed.
Ricardo Ciciliano scored the winner from the spot to move Millonarios up to mid-table, with four points from three games.
Medellin and Santa Fe are joint leaders in the Apertura with a maximum nine points each and both teams collected away wins at the weekend.
Medellin edged out Cucuta by a single goal and Santa Fe collected a 2-1 win at Deportivo Pasto.
Holder Mikhail Youzhny made a shock first-round exit at the World Indoor Tournament on Monday, losing 7-6 6-4 to unseeded Serb Janko Tipsarevic.
The fourth-seeded Russian broke serve in the fifth game but Tipsarevic hit back to level before taking the tiebreak 7-3.
Youzhny, who routed world number two Rafael Nadal 6-0 6-1 in last month's Chennai Open final, also dropped his serve in the first game of the second set as his opponent took command from the baseline.
Although I've hardly played in recent weeks through illness I still felt the good vibes from Australian Open, Tipsarevic told reporters.
The Serb reached the third round of the grand slam event in Melbourne but had to pull out of the Davis Cup tie with Russia in Moscow earlier this month due to a stomach bug.
Physically it was tough today but mentally I stayed positive, said Tipsarevic.
Mikhail is an aggressive player and I had to prevent him taking control.
I just had to keep him moving.
Former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero was also beaten 7-5 6-1 by Russian qualifier Teimuraz Gabashvili.
The seventh seed from Spain, now ranked 20th in the world, had little answer to number 132 Gabashvili.
I didn't play my best tennis from the beginning and felt slow today after I had stomach problems yesterday, said Ferrero.
I played some good points but overall I made too many mistakes.
Monday's defeat followed Ferrero's second-round exit at last week's Marseille Open.
My goals for this season are just getting back in the top 10 and until this match I had played well, he said.
Unseeded Croatian Ivo Karlovic thumped 12 aces as he went through with a 6-1 6-2 victory over Olivier Rochus of Belgium.
A lucky Homare Sawa goal three minutes into stoppage time gave Japan a 3-2 victory over regional giants North Korea in the opener of the East Asian Women's Football Championship here Monday.
Sawa trapped a throw-in from the right touchline before looping a 30-metre shot over goalkeeper Han Hye-Yong and into the far-side corner of the net in the dying seconds of the game.
The last-gasp win avenged Japan's 1-0 loss to North Korea in the opener of the last East Asian Championship, in 2005, which was won by South Korea.

Honda's former world champion Nicky Hayden set the pace on the final day of MotoGP's official pre-season test at the Jerez circuit in southern Spain on Monday.
The American, who lost his crown to Ducati's Australian Casey Stoner last season, clocked the fastest time of the test with a lap of one minute 38.848 seconds at the end of the afternoon.
The test was the first time this year that the top teams and riders had come together at the same circuit, only weeks before the season starts in Qatar on March 9.
The final pre-season test in Doha in 10 days' time will be held under floodlights to help riders prepare for MotoGP's first night race.
Yamaha's 20-year-old Spanish rookie Jorge Lorenzo, the 250cc world champion who will be the youngest rider on the MotoGP grid this year, was second quickest at the end of a breezy session in Jerez with a time 0.404 slower.
Italian Andrea Dovizioso was third on a JiR Honda with compatriot and former champion Valentino Rossi fifth on a Yamaha.
We've finished the three days second after a very fast lap this afternoon with the Michelin qualifying tyre, so I'm really happy about this, said Lorenzo in a statement.
With the race tyre, however, we're not in such good shape and we have quite a lot of work to do.
We need to be faster but to do this I need to have more grip and more confidence.
British MotoGP newcomer James Toseland was sixth fastest for Tech3 Yamaha despite crashing on his second lap of the day.

I hope to be able to do another contract in 2013.
This is proof that Kaka will keep delighting our fans for all of his career.
The World Player of the Year was the driving force behind Milan's victorious Champions League campaign last season, scoring 10 goals on the way to the final.
Real Madrid tried to tempt Milan to sell Kaka throughout the close season with an 80 million euro offer and the Italian club even acknowledged that Kaka'a father and agent had held talks with the Spanish champions.
Davis suffered a neck injury in November and is still only at 80 percent strength.
It still niggles a bit but everything is better, it's more a case of getting back the strength, he said.
We all want to hit the ball hard, It is a bomber's game now and you can't afford not to, he said.
Three-times major winner Ernie Els of South Africa, New Zealander Tim Wilkinson and Americans Kevin Sutherland, Jimmy Walker and Brett Quigley all carded 67s.
Hertha Berlin moved to tenth in the Bundesliga standings on Friday with a 2-0 victory against bottom club MSV Duisburg.
The victory with two goals in the space of two minutes by Marko Pantelic and Raffael in the 35th and 37th minutes will have taken some pressure of a Berlin side that has been performing well under its capabilities this season.
Brazilian striker Raffael opened the scoring in the 35th when his header crashed against the cross-bar, bounced to Pantelic, who then pushed it to the Brazilian who in turn had a simple tap in from close range.
Two minutes later it was Raffael who turned provider with a defence-splitting pass that sent Pantelic into space and the Serbian made no mistake.
In the second half Hertha sat back and played counter attacking football, while Duisburg, who remain rooted to the bottom of the table with 17 points, were simply not strong enough to put the Berlin goal under any real pressure.
Berlin are in tenth place on 30 points.
Bayern Munich, who are away to Schalke on the weekend, head the table with 44 points, four ahead of second-placed Werder Bremen.
Svetlana Kuznetsova will face Elena Dementieva in an all-Russian final at the Dubai Open on Saturday after the pair won marathon semi-finals.
Second-seed Kuznetsova overcame Serbian fourth seed Jelena Jankovic 5-7 6-4 6-3 on Friday, and eighth-seeded Dementieva was also stretched before beating unseeded Italian Francesca Schiavone 5-7 7-5 6-2.
Both matches took almost three hours. 
Kuznetsova twice took the lead in the opening set before immediately dropping her own serve.
After missing out on a set point at 5-4, she was left to rue her missed opportunity when Jankovic came back strongly to wrap up the first set.
Instead of hanging her head, the Russian responded by jumping to a 3-0 lead in the second.
But her advantage was short-lived as Jankovic broke twice to streak 4-3 ahead.
This time it was Jankovic who let her chance slip away as Kuznetsova claimed the next three games.
After an early exchange of breaks in the deciding set, Jankovic visibly waned.
Kuznetsova survived three break points at 2-2 and then broke to lead 4-2.
She squandered six match points on the Jankovic serve before serving out to love for victory.
The match was going longer and longer and I was feeling better and better.
I cannot explain it, Kuznetsova told reporters.
I was far from my best game and it was very important to stay focused because usually when I play her I have so many chances and when I don't use them I get so frustrated.
Today it was very important for me to get through it.
I thought I did it pretty well, and in the third set I just had to stay calm and play my game.
Dementieva and Schiavone engaged in a succession of very lengthy but highly entertaining rallies, some stretching to over 30 exchanges.
Dementieva led 5-3, but she allowed the Italian, who knocked out world number one Justine Henin on Thursday, to snatch the next four games and the set.
After a series of service breaks in the second set Schiavone dropped her serve at 4-4, and although Dementieva failed to serve out the set at 5-4 she broke again to lead 6-5 and then levelled the match.
Schiavone, who received treatment for a tight quad muscle, was able to earn just seven points as Dementieva swept to a 4-0 lead in the deciding set.
The toughest part was losing the first set, said Dementieva.
I was 5-3, serving for the set and had so many opportunities and didn't use them.
I had to be able to stay calm and positive after losing that set and that was not easy.
I'm glad I was able to fight and win the second set. 
That gave me so much confidence and I was finishing strongly in the third.
Brazil playmaker Kaka, who this week extended his contract with AC Milan until 2013, wants to spend the rest of his career at the club.
Last year the Milan Channel asked me if I wanted to stay for life and on that occasion I didn't have the confidence and drive I have today, FIFA's World Player of the Year told the club's in-house television station on Friday.
Today I can say it.
I want to stay Rossonero all of my career.
I want to stay here for life.
According to Italian media reports, the 25-year-old will earn nine million euros a year net under the terms of his new deal with the European champions.
Kaka also said he wanted to skipper Milan one day.
This is my fifth season at Milan, he said.
I want to become a symbol, a standard-bearer and one day a captain of this club.
Kaka was the driving force behind Milan's victorious Champions League campaign last season, scoring 10 goals.
The seven-times European champions have fended off several attempts by Real Madrid to buy the player, with the Spanish champions making an offer of 80 million euros in the close season.
The Iranian Football Federation has appointed Iranian-American Afshin Qotbi as new head coach for Iran's national football team, state television reported Friday.
Deputy FFI president Mehdi Taj told state television that Qotbi, trainer of Persepolis Tehran, has prevailed over four other local contenders for the post.
The 45-year-old Qotbi will head the national team in the first round of the World Cup qualification games against Kuwait, Syria and the United Arab Emirates, Taj said.
In case of success, the 45-year-old would also take the team into the second round and eventually to the games in South Africa, Taj added.
Iran, which had been the only national side in Asia without a head coach since last July, started its World Cup qualification games with a disappointing goalless draw against Syria earlier this month.
The second game will be against Kuwait next month.
Qotbi, 45, is an electrical engineering graduate from the United States, who however soon turned to his real passion which was football.
He has strong coaching credentials, including a spell at Korean side Samsung and was technical assistant to South Korea under Dutchman Guus Hiddink.
Football observers in Iran consider Qotbi as a much better option than second-hand foreign coaches.
The FFI had in the recent weeks tried to employ Portuguese Artur Jorge and Spanish Javier Clemente but both efforts failed, especially with Clemente who had even signed a contract but his main demand not to live in Iran permanently was eventually rejected by the Iranian side.
Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano signed a four-year contract with Liverpool on Friday.
This is the best moment in my career, he told the Premier League club's Web site.
I am very, very happy and now I can concentrate just on playing football, said the 23-year-old.
He joined Liverpool on loan from fellow Premier League club West Ham United in January 2007 before helping his new team reach the Champions League final in May.
Liverpool spokesman Ian Cotton said: Javier Mascherano came to Liverpool on a fixed term contract under an agreement disclosed to and approved by both the Football Association and Premier League.
His contract has now been extended under the provisions of that agreement We have no further comment to make, he added in an email to Reuters.
Mascherano joined West Ham in a controversial double move with compatriot Carlos Tevez in August 2006 in which they were loaned to the London club by Media Sports Investments.
Liverpool gave no financial details on the deal, leaving undisclosed the size of any transfer fee paid to MSI.
British media reports in the January transfer window said Mascherano could cost about 17 million pounds.
Argentina striker Tevez now plays for Manchester United.
Mascherano, a key member of the Argentina side voted FIFA's team of the year in 2007, began his career at River Plate before joining Brazilian club Corinthians in 2005.
A member of the Argentina side that reached the 2006 World Cup quarter-finals, Mascherano has 36 caps.
Olympique Lyon opened a six-point lead at the top of Ligue 1 when a first-half Fred goal earned a 1-0 win over Lille at the Stade de France on Saturday.
The six times champions now have 55 points from 27 matches with second-placed Girondins Bordeaux, who host Paris St Germain on Sunday, on 49.
The game broke the Ligue 1 attendance record with 77,850 fans showing up to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the stadium where France won the 1998 World Cup.
The previous record was set at the Stade Velodrome when 57,609 watched Olympique Marseille play Lyon on Aug. 15, 2005.
Lyon went ahead after 32 minutes on Saturday when Brazilian striker Fred netted with a low cross shot after being set up by right back Francois Clerc.
It was the third goal in two matches for Fred, who had played only nine league games this season before scoring a double against Metz last weekend.
Lille almost equalised when Pierre-Alain Frau's effort struck Gregory Coupet's bar on the hour.
With Lyon facing Manchester United in a last 16 Champions League tie at Old Trafford on Tuesday, following a 1-1 draw in the first leg, coach Alain Perrin made changes after an hour.
He replaced France striker Karim Benzema with Hatem Ben Arfa and 14 minutes later Abdulkader Keita came on for winger Sidney Govou.
Arsenal scored a late goal to force a 1-1 draw against Aston Villa although their lead at the top of the Premier League was cut to one point after Manchester United won 3-0 at Fulham on Saturday.
Substitute Nicklas Bendtner netted with seconds remaining to deny Villa victory and take Arsenal to 65 points, one more than United who stay second.
Third-placed Chelsea won 4-0 at West Ham United despite having Frank Lampard, who scored the opening goal against his former club, sent off after 33 minutes for what appeared to be an innocuous push on Luis Boa Morte.
Chelsea have 58 points and a game in hand on the top two.
For much of the afternoon, Arsenal struggled against Villa and looked to be heading for their first home league defeat of the season and only their second at the Emirates since moving there at the start of last season.
Villa went ahead when Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos turned a Gabriel Agbonlahor shot into his own net after 27 minutes and were in control with some excellent football.
However, Arsenal kept pushing forward and were rewarded just before the end with Bendtner's close-range goal.
We were dominated physically and technically by Aston Villa but came back in the second half.
The point could be of vital importance at the end of the season, relieved Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports News.
Manchester United, who had not been beaten at Fulham since 1964, never looked like losing that record after Owen Hargreaves put them ahead with a clever free kick in the 15th minute, his first goal for United.
Park Ji-sung's 44th minute header and a Simon Davies own goal after 72 minutes gave United a straightforward victory, leaving Fulham deep in relegation trouble.
It was a professional performance and we did the job well, United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports.
Hamburg SV won 4-1 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt to regain third place in the Bundesliga on Sunday, as close rivals Bayer Leverkusen slipped to a 2-0 defeat away to VfL Bochum.
Peruvian international Paolo Guerrero struck twice and Nigel de Jong and African Nations Cup winner Mohamed Zidan were also on target to help Hamburg stretch their unbeaten run to seven league matches.
The result was enough to give Hamburg a three-point advantage in third place the final Champions League qualifying slot after Leverkusen fell to Bochum goals from Thomas Zdebel and Christoph Dabrowski in the final 25 minutes.

The Azurean side remain sixth with 39 points from 27 games, one adrift of Le Mans, who lost 1-0 to Racing Strasbourg on Saturday.
St Etienne, who dominated most of the game but proved too clumsy in the box, stay 10th in the standings on 36 points.
Villarreal missed their chance to tighten their grip on a Champions League berth on Sunday when they were held to a 0-0 draw at home by struggling Osasuna.
Manuel Pelligrini's side lacked their usual fluency and bite in attack and were unable to break down a dogged Osasuna defence in a dour affair at the Madrigal.
Despite the draw Villarreal remain in third spot in the table, but are now just three points clear of Atletico Madrid who thumped second-placed Barcelona 4-2 at the Calderon on Saturday.
Real Madrid cashed in on Barcelona's slip-up with a 3-2 win at Recreativo Huelva on Saturday that allowed them to restore their five-point advantage over the Catalans at the top of the table.

Surprise package Racing Santander moved up to sixth place thanks to a 1-0 victory at Valladolid on Sunday, Argentine midfielder Aldo Duscher striking a late winner when he ballooned a shot into the far corner four minutes from time.
The match of the day, though, was at the Coliseum in Madrid where 10-man Real Mallorca scored two quick-fire goals late in the second half to spoil Getafe's impressive run of recent form and earn themselves a point in an entertaining 3-3 draw.
Getafe looked to be on course for an easy win after strikes from Mario Cotelo and Juan Albin and an own goal from Ivan Ramis put them 3-1 up against the islanders, who were reduced to 10 men when Lionel Scaloni was sent off late in the first half.
But Mallorca were thrown a lifeline 13 minutes from time when striker Juan Arango let fly with a superbly struck free kick from 25 metres out.
Minutes later the Venezuelan international provided the assist for defender Ramis to skim a header into the net after another great free kick.
Despite the draw Michael Laudrup's Getafe, who are in the last 16 of the UEFA Cup and on the verge of a securing a place in the final of the King's Cup for the second season in succession, remain in 10th place in the table.
They are a point clear of an improving Real Betis who crushed relegation-threatened Real Murcia 4-0 in Seville.
Real Zaragoza were dragged into the danger zone after they slumped to their fourth defeat in a row when they went down 2-1 away to basement side Levante and are now languishing in 17th place in the standings.
Levante remain anchored to the foot of the table with 19 points, four adrift of Murcia and 10 behind Recreativo, but there are seven other sides within three points of the relegation zone.

I started off really nervous and she played better and better in the first set, King told reporters after winning her second Tour match out of six this year. 
At the end of the first set, I changed my strategy and that worked out well.
I was really happy to come out with the win after just fighting.
King, who next meets 31st seed Tathiana Garbin of Italy in the second round, was sidelined for three weeks last month with a viral illness.
My body isn't 100 percent but I've been trying the best I can, the Californian said.
I think I'm ready.
Every day I've been playing better and better.
I'm just happy to be out here.

Italy's Raffaele Illiano prevailed in a sprint finish to take the second stage of the Tirreno-Adriatico race from Civitavecchia to Gubbio on Thursday.
The Diquigiovanni rider beat compatriot Enrico Gasparotto and team mate Niklas Axelsson of Norway after being part of a six-rider attack that formed 20km from the finish of the 203km stage.
Gasparotto is the new race leader with Axelsson second at two seconds back and Germany's Linus Gerdemann six seconds down.
Illiano was in tears after taking the most important victory of his seven-year professional career.
I'm incredibly happy.
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
I've only ever won minor races but now I think I've earned my place in the professional peloton, he said.
I crashed during the first stage and I've got five stitches in my right knee but I felt good and so went with the late attack.
Team Barloworld rider Gasparotto was disappointed not to win the sprint but added the race leader's blue jersey to the pink jersey he won in the prologue of the Giro d'Italia last year and the red, white and green Italian national champion's jersey he won in 2005.
I was suffering with cramp in the final kilometres of the stage and that definitely affected my chances in the sprint.
However I'm happy to have the leader's jersey and will try and keep it for as long as possible, Gasparotto said.

Bulgaria striker Blagoy Georgiev intercepted the ball in midfield and made a superb solo run down the left before beating goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with a fine shot inside the far post.
We had a hard time finding the openings, said Schalke coach Mirko Slomka after Duisburg played with 10 men behind the ball for much of the game.
And after we fell behind our fans weren't amused.
But in the second half we threw everything we had at them and were able to turn it around.
Duisburg coach Rudi Bommer blamed second-half mistakes.
We played very well defensively in the first half and had some good scoring chances as well, he said.
But in the second half we didn't have the courage we had in the first half.
Schalke stay fifth with 41 points, nine behind leaders Bayern Munich who visit bottom club Energie Cottbus on Saturday.

Defending champion Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia and fourth-seeded Russian Maria Sharapova breezed through their opening matches in the Pacific Life Open second round on Friday.
Hantuchova swept past American wildcard Angela Haynes 6-1 6-2 in windy conditions at the Indian Well Tennis Garden before Sharapova crushed French qualifier Stephanie Cohen-Aloro 6-1 6-0.
The 24-year-old Hantuchova, who won the tournament for a second time by beating Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova in last year's final, broke three times in each set to seal victory in just over an hour.
That felt great, the fifth seed told reporters.
It was an incredible feeling to be back on the center court.
Hantuchova advances to a third round match with China's Zheng Jie, who upset 30th-seeded Ukrainian Kateryna Bondarenko 6-2 6-4.
It definitely feels like it's my home out there, the Slovakian added.
I wish I could play every match of the year on this court.
I don't know what it is.
I guess it's the bounce.
It's not too slow, not too fast.
The only problem for Hantuchova on a sun-drenched day was the swirling wind.
It was very, very tough, she said.
In a wind like this, you never know what to expect.
It evens the match, really, because even though you might hit a good shot, it can still go out or it can be too short.
I'm very glad how I handled the conditions.
Sharapova, who won her third grand slam at the Australian Open in January, broke Cohen-Aloro twice in the first set and three times in the second to wrap up the match in 58 minutes.
This has been an incredible start to the year and it's great to be playing in my second home of California, said the Russian, who is unbeaten in 15 WTA matches this season.
A couple of weeks ago we were playing a tournament in Doha and I've never played tennis in so much wind, she added.
You get used to it and it was the same for my opponent.

Favourites Bayern Munich will face Spanish debutants Getafe in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup next month.
Friday's draw pitched the Bundesliga leaders, four-times European champions and 1996 UEFA Cup winners against a club enjoying their first taste of European competition.
The outstanding tie of the round is PSV Eindhoven against Fiorentina.
Germany's other representatives Bayer Leverkusen, the 1988 UEFA Cup winners, meet Zenit St Petersburg while Rangers, the sole British survivors, face Sporting Lisbon.
The first legs will be played on April 3 and the second legs a week later.
We have been drawn against one of the strongest teams, Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld told the club's Web site.
Germany striker Miroslav Klose said: I said before the draw hopefully not Getafe or St Petersburg.
That's no easy hurdle but certainly one we can overcome.
Getafe coach Michael Laudrup was delighted with the draw.
What more could we want?, said Laudrup.
The chance to play against the favourites, the first leg over there and the second leg here.
If we go out there is no better way but if we win what more can I say? .
PSV and Fiorentina won penalty shootouts against English clubs on Wednesday.
Dutch side PSV beat Tottenham Hotspur 6-5 in a shootout after losing 1-0 at home for a 1-1 aggregate draw.
Fiorentina went down 2-0 at Everton to draw their tie 2-2 on aggregate before winning the shootout 4-2.
Both clubs have tasted European glory in the past, the Italians winning the first Cup Winners' Cup in 1961 and PSV lifting the 1978 UEFA Cup and 1988 European Cup.
Rangers and Sporting are previous winners of the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup.
The Portuguese side also lost the 2005 UEFA Cup final to CSKA Moscow.
Should the two German clubs win they will meet in the semi-finals.
The final is at the City of Manchester Stadium on May 14.
Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o would have preferred facing Chelsea or Manchester United rather than Schalke 04 in the Champions League quarter-finals.
There are lots of other people who would have wanted Schalke, but I can assure you there are no easy games, the Cameroon international told reporters after Friday's draw.
I would have preferred to be drawn against Chelsea or Manchester United because at least then you would have been going with the idea that it is going to be tough.
Games like these can be a trap and I hope we don't fall into it because Schalke deserve to be there just like any other team.
Spanish media were unanimous Barca had a favourable draw by avoiding the four British teams and getting the unfancied Bundesliga side making their first appearance in the last eight.
To support his argument, though, Eto'o referred to last year's King's Cup tie against semi-final debutants Getafe when Barcelona let a 5-2 first-leg lead slip as they went out of the competition after embarrassing 4-0 defeat in the return.
We saw what happened in the King's Cup last year when we played Getafe, he said.
When we play to our best and concentrate, there is no one who can beat us, but we have to be 100 percent focused.
Barca are scheduled to visit Gelsenkirchen on April 1, with the return at the Nou Camp on April 9.
Real Betis's Primera Liga match against Athletic Bilbao was abandoned on Saturday after visiting goalkeeper Armando was struck by a bottle thrown by a fan.
Bilbao were leading 2-1 during the second half at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera stadium when a fan behind the goal threw what looked like a small plastic bottle full of liquid at Armando.
The keeper, who had gone to get the ball for a goalkick, was treated on the pitch and taken off on a stretcher. 
Referee Carlos Clos Gomez stopped the game with about 18 minutes left.
Armando suffered a blow to the right eye and has bruising and a cut in the same area. He has had stitches, Bilbao said on their Web site.
Betis's Web site said: The aggressor was immediately detained by the stadium's private security and will be prevented from attending future sporting events. 
It is not the first time such an incident has occurred at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera.
Last season, Sevilla coach Juande Ramos, now at Tottenham Hotspur, was knocked out after being hit by a bottle thrown from the stands during a King's Cup quarter-final match there.

Real Madrid lost 1-0 against Deportivo Coruna in the Primera Liga on Saturday as they failed to break their jinx at the Riazor.

Real stay eight points clear of second-placed Barcelona, who have 54, but Frank Rijkaard's side can close to within five with a win in Almeria on Sunday.
I don't think we played a good game but I think a 0-0 draw would have been a fair result, Real coach Bernd Schuster said.
The match between Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera was abandoned midway through the second half with the score at 2-1 after Bilbao goalkeeper Armando was hit in the face by a bottle thrown from the stands.
Armando had stitches for a cut near his eye.
In the late game, Brazil striker Luis Fabiano took his tally for the season to 22 with both goals in Sevilla's 2-0 win at Valencia.
The first was a well-taken free-kick in the 11th minute and the second came soon after as he diverted Seydou Keita's long-range shot past Timo Hildebrand.
Although defender Raul Albiol pulled one back right at the end, Valencia and their under-fire coach Ronald Koeman left the pitch to a barrage of whistles from the home crowd.
Sevilla climbed to fourth place with 45 points, one ahead of Atletico Madrid and Racing Santander who play Levante and Getafe respectively on Sunday.

Marseille now have 46 points to Nancy's 49 after the Lorraine side drew 1-1 at Sochaux on Saturday.
Lens stay 16th on 34 points, two above the relegation zone.
At Bordeaux's stade Chaban-Delmas, defender Henrique headed home from an Alejandro Alonso corner kick on 28 minutes and the Brazilian's second goal three minutes from the interval was a carbon copy of the opener.
Argentine striker Fernando Cavenaghi made it three 15 minutes from time by firing home from a bad clearance for his 10th goal in his last 10 league matches.
Bayer Leverkusen jumped ahead of slumping Werder Bremen into third place behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich and Hamburg SV with a 4-1 home victory against Nuremberg on Sunday.
Bremen started the weekend in second but squandered their chance to capitalise on Bayern's shock 2-0 defeat at Energie Cottbus on Saturday.
Bremen were beaten 1-0 at home by VfL Wolfsburg, their third league defeat in the last four matches.
Bayern lead the table with 50 points, Hamburg are second with 45, Leverkusen third with 44 and Bremen, who were also knocked out of the UEFA Cup on Thursday, are fourth on 43.
Brazil's Grafite scored the match winner in the rain for Wolfsburg five minutes after the intermission, firing home from the right at the end of a high-speed one-two with compatriot Marcelinho that began in midfield.
They were handicapped by having to play on Thursday and with all the injuries they've had, Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath told Premiere Television.
Wolfsburg have the league's best record since the winter break with 16 points from seven matches.
But our team played extremely well, added Magath, whose team face Bayern Munich in the semi-finals of the German Cup on Wednesday.
We had several chances to get the second goal and I think that shows we deserved to win.
Brazilian international Marcelinho is under investigation by German police and faces a possible grievous bodily harm charge following a late-night attack in a Berlin nightclub.
German tabloid Bild reported the 32-year-old VfL Wolfsburg midfielder, who has five caps for Brazil and scored one goal, is being investigated after a 44-year-old man received five stitches in a head wound in the early hours of Easter Monday.
The man reported the incident to the police and a spokesman confirmed an investigation has been launched.
The incident at the Cazz Club in Charlottenburg left the man - simply known as Ingo H - covered in blood and he received treatment at a hospital in the suburb of Kreuzberg.
The man claims he was attacked by the Brazilian star with a beer bottle after a disagreement, but Marcelinho is adamant he did nothing wrong.
The man provoked me and there was a set to, the Brazilian told Bild.
If this man wants to go to the police, the matter will be clarified by the police.
David Beckham will win his 100th cap for England in Wednesday's friendly against France here at the Stade de France coach Fabio Capello said on Tuesday.
The Italian confirmed Beckham, who has been recalled to his squad, would play at some stage although he did not say whether he would be in the starting line-up.
David will play a part, Capello said, It would have been very cruel of me to make him come all the way from the United States and not played him.
The LA Galaxy midfielder was left out of Capello's squad for his first game in charge against Switzerland, but has been brought back in despite his lack of match fitness.
Beckham will be the fifth England player to win a ton of caps after Billy Wright, Sir Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore and Peter Shilton.
Porto president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa will stand trial for allegedly bribing a referee before a Portuguese Premier League match in 2004, a Porto tribunal source told Reuters on Tuesday.
The referee, Augusto Duarte, who was in charge of the match between Beira Mar and Porto that year which ended in a goalless draw, will also stand trial for corruption, the source said.
Pinto da Costa's lawyer declined to comment while Duarte was not immediately available to comment.
The decision, by a criminal court in Portugal's northern city of Porto, follows an investigation branded Apito Dourado which began in 2003 and involves several soccer directors and referees, according to media reports.
The Lusa news agency quoted Portugal's public prosecutor's office saying Pinto da Costa was suspected of giving an envelope containing 2,500 euros to Duarte before the match.
No date has been set for the trial, Lusa said.
The trial follows publication of a book by an ex-girlfriend of the president of Premier League leaders Porto, which alleged the team had often benefited from bribes paid to referees.
Former champions Renault canstill win grands prix this year despite a difficult start to the Formula One season, team boss Flavio Briatore said on Tuesday.
I think so, yes, in Barcelona we have the new package and absolutely yes we can win, he told Reuters.
Briatore was speaking after announcing a new 20 million pounds five-year sponsorship deal with Italian clothing company Lotto for his English Championship second division soccer club Queens Park Rangers.
The Spanish Grand Prix, a home race for Renault's double world champion Fernando Alonso, is the fourth round of the season on April 27.
Renault, champions in 2005 and 2006 with Alonso, have not won a race since October 2006 and chalked up just one podium finish last year after the Spaniard had left to drive for McLaren.
Alonso has now returned to the French team, where he is partnered with Brazilian rookie Nelson Piquet, but struggled to eighth place in Malaysia last weekend after finishing fourth in the Australian season-opener.
His view of the future seemingly differed from Briatore's, with the Spaniard telling the As sports daily on Monday he was not expecting any big step forward.
In Barcelona we will have some improvements for the car, the same ones all the teams will have, so the championship is going to stay more or less the same, he said.
We saw it last year and we see it every year.
The cars that win the first two or three races stay on top.
We are not going to see big surprises during the year.
Briatore would not be drawn on whether he thought QPR would be in the Premier League before Renault were champions again.
It's difficult to say because nobody expected Renault to win the championships in 2005 and 2006.
I don't know, let's see, he said.
The Italian also brushed aside talk about Alonso's future, with media speculation in Spain still linking the Spaniard to a move to Ferrari as a replacement for Brazilian Felipe Massa.
Massa has failed to score a point in two races this year but has a contract with the Italian team to the end of 2010.
This story you remember was already last year and in the end he signed with Renault, said Briatore.
The team boss is a co-owner of QPR with Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone and Indian steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal.
Bernie is an incredible asset for QPR and we have fun as well, Briatore said of their partnership.
In life you need to have fun, but you have fun only if you are successful.
I think there is a lot of synergy because we want to be competitive and be the best and this is the same in football as well as Formula One.
Former world champions Zab Judah and Shane Mosley will meet May 31 at Las Vegas to see who might earn another world title chance with unbeaten welterweight champions Floyd Mayweather and Miguel Cotto.
Mosley, 44-5 with 37 knockouts, has won world crowns in three weight classes but the 36-year-old veteran lost a decision last November to unbeaten World Boxing Association champion Cotto.
It's extremely high stakes for Zab and myself in this fight, Mosley said.
We have similar styles in terms of speed and power.
I am hungry for this victory and confident I'll get it.
Judah, is 36-5 with 25 knockouts and has won world titles in two weight classes, once holding the undisputed welterweight throne before losing all three crowns in three different fights.
Judah lost unanimous 2006 decisions to Mayweather, the World Boxing Council champion, and Carlos Baldomir and was stopped in the 11th round by Puerto Rico's Cotto last June.
I'm willing to gamble everything on this fight and I know I have to win it to set my career back on the winning path, Judah said.
I respect Shane as a great fighter but I know he can't go 12 fast rounds with me.
I plan to take him into deep waters and be the first one to stop him.
A first-half penalty by Franck Ribery spoiled David Beckham's 100th appearance for England by giving France a 1-0 friendly win at the Stade de France on Wednesday.
Midfielder Ribery hit the winner from the spot against the run of play on 32 minutes after Nicolas Anelka was brought down in the box by England goalkeeper David James.
The 32-year-old Beckham started the match to become the fifth English player to achieve a century of appearances for his country.
He worked tirelessly on the right wing and received a first-half booking before being replaced by David Bentley on 63 minutes.
England, who failed to qualify for the European championship finals and have not beaten France in Paris since a 3-1 friendly win in 1949, fought bravely before the break but gradually tired.
David Villa scored a stunning left-foot volley to give perenial under-achievers Spain a morale-boosting 1-0 victory over Spain here on Wednesday.
In a match between two of the favourites for the Euro 2008 title in June in Austria and Switzerland it took a moment of genius from the Valencia star to settle the affair.
In fairness, though, neither side showed much to suggest they would be the team to look out for in the summer in what was at times a cagey, uneventful match.
Spanish coach Luis Aragones said the better side had won.
We deserved to score even if the match was finely balanced, said Aragones, Italy are a difficult adversary.
However, the ever enigmatic coach refused to say whether the squad for the Euro 2008 finals would be effectively the one he had selected for this match.
I do not know whether that is the definitive squad or not.
There is still time before the championships.
I am not a divine being.
His Italy counterpart Roberto Donadoni claimed his side had deserved more than they got.
It was a good match and we didn't deserve to lose, he said.
But it was a great goal and all we can do is congratulate him.
Donadoni, a former elegant attacking midfielder who was part of the Italy side that reached the 1990 World Cup semi-finals, refused to be drawn on his contract situation.
The Italy's boss's deal runs out at the end of June and he has not signed an extension.
I don't know what to say, there's nothing to say, he said.
I'm doing my job with passion and committment.
Italy actually had the ball in the net on 13 minutes but Bayern Munich striker Luca Toni's header was mysteriously disallowed.
Spain were next to threaten but Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon came to the visitors' rescue twice in quick succession on 37 minutes.
First he blocked a shot from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres and then he was alert to stop a poked finish from Arsenal playmaker Cesc Fabregas on the follow-up.
Chances were few and far between but six minutes after the break world champions Italy came within a lick of paint of taking the lead.
Lyon full-back Fabio Grosso got down the left and crossed into the centre where Argentina-born Juventus midfielder Mauro Camoranesi smashed his volley onto the bar before substitute defender Raul Albiol blocked Toni's follow-up with his face.
Camoranesi had another couple of half chances as Italy took the ascendancy but the Spanish back line held firm.
But the goal came 14 minutes from time as Fabio Cannavaro failed to clear the danger properly from Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta's speculative long ball forward.
Villa set himself on the edge of the area and waited for Cannavaro's headed clearance to drop before thrashing a volley into the top corner.
Late on Villa had another chance to extend the lead from a glorious long pass from Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso but Buffon was out quickly to narrow the angle and block with his legs.
Germany's Tommy Haas pulled out of the ATP Masters Series hardcourt tournament because of a sinus infection, organizers announced here on Wednesday.
The 29-year-old, ranked 36th on the ATP Tour, retired from a quarter-final match against Swiss world number one Roger Federer last week at Indian Wells, California, for the same reason.
The German standout, who looked to be returning to the sort of form that saw him rise as high as number two in the world when he beat Andy Roddick in Indian Wells, was replaced for a night match on Wednesday in the main draw by Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, who will face Haas' compatriot Nicolas Kiefer in a first-round match.
Haas admitted earlier this month that he didn't think he would ever return to his peak because of undergoing a third shoulder operation and a series of poor results since then.
David Beckham showed he could still play a role for England when he won his 100th cap in a 1-0 defeat to France in a friendly on Wednesday.
The LA Galaxy midfielder looked a little rusty at times but gave a typically hard-working performance at the Stade de France and was involved in much of England's attacking play before being replaced by David Bentley in the 63rd minute.
The 32-year-old, who made his England debut against Moldova in a World Cup qualifier in September 1996, became only the fifth English player to achieve a century of appearances for his country.
Beckham won his 99th cap in England's 3-2 home defeat against Croatia in a Euro qualifier at Wembley last November.
I am very proud of this 100th cap.
It does not happen to everybody.
It was amazing, he told reporters.
It was special to win it here, where Zidane played, and I have also got a house in France.
The most important thing was to prove my fitness and I thought I did.
I felt very fresh, a lot fresher than I thought I would be.
Tonight I enjoyed myself, that's the biggest thing.
Camera flashes sparkled around the stadium when the former Manchester United favourite took his first corner kick, which was cleared by the French defence in the sixth minute.
Beckham then fell just short of netting his 18th goal for his country when he failed to connect at the far post with a low Ashley Cole cross.
Wearing golden boots to mark the milestone, Beckham also got the opportunity to show his defending skills, often switching to a full back position with former United team mate Wes Brown.
It is something we've played with Wes when we were with United.
I also used to do it with Gary Neville, he said.
He picked up a yellow card eight minutes before the interval when his lack of condition forced him to pull Franck Ribery's shirt.
Beckham saved his team from the threat posed by Nicolas Anelka by beating the Chelsea forward to the ball just before being replaced by Bentley to a standing ovation from both the French and English fans.
His last contribution was a trademark 50-metre crossfield pass to Stewart Downing.
Then his number flashed up on the replacement board and he left applauding the fans who were cheering him.
David played like I know he can play, said coach Fabio Capello.
I only substituted him because I wanted to see other players and I know him well.
France defender William Gallas approached Beckham at fulltime to swap shirts but the England man declined.
He didask me but I think he forgot what game it was for me, he told Sky Sports.
The last-chance return to tennis of Paradorn Srichaphan may make the Davis Cup task of Australia a bit tougher when the nations meet in three weeks in an Asian zonal tie.
The April 11-13 throwdown in Townsville will be the test of fire for former top Thai Paradorn, who has not played in a year after a wrist injury and ensuing surgery.
But the 28-year-old has now been included in the side which will travel to Queensland in hopes of derailing Australian chances of returning to the World Group.
Paradorn, a one-time world No. 9, last competed a year ago in Miami, losing in the first round and realising he had to cure his right wrist problem.
Australian captain John Fitzgerald will now have one more problem to puzzle through on his team which is led - again - by Lleyton Hewitt with backup from No. 68 Chris Guccione.
It creates interest in the tie, doesn't it?, said the Aussie skipper.
I think they've maybe made bookings for him but I don't know if he'll come.
Paradorn now vows to give his return a final push before eventual retirement as a national sporting hero at home with a former beauty pageant queen Russian-Canadian wife.
He will benefit from an injury-protected ranking of 75, which will allow him to enter nine ATP events.
To be back in the top 50 will not be easy as I'm a senior player now, and there are many new guys who are only 18-19.
Regional heavyweights Japan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia all suffered surprise defeats as lower-ranked teams dominated Asia's World Cup qualifiers on Wednesday.
Three times qualifiers Japan, missing their European-based players, went down 1-0 to Bahrain in Manama with Aala Hubail's 77th minute strike moving the gritty Gulf side to the top of the Group 2 standings.
Saudi Arabia, who have been to the finals four times, were thrashed 3-0 by Uzbekistan, while the misery continued for unsettled Asian Cup holders Iraq, who are now rooted to the bottom of Group 1 after losing 2-0 to Qatar.
Problem-plagued Iran ended their humiliating scoring drought but threw away a two-goal lead to draw with Kuwait.
Mark Schwarzer's late penalty save helped injury-hit newcomers Australia scrape a point away to struggling China to keep the Socceroos top of Group 1.
Middlesbrough keeper Schwarzer looked to have lost Australia the match when he brought down Qu Bo in the area, but he instantly made amends by stopping Shao Jiayi's spot kick with a minute remaining in high-altitude in Kunming.
To lose that match to a late penalty would have been a disaster for us because I thought we deserved to get something out of the game, Schwarzer told Australian television.
In Tashkent, the Saudis lacked their usual firepower and were stunned when the Uzbeks scored three times either side of halftime.
Timur Kapadze netted just before the break, Maksim Shatskikh added another on 65 minutes and Server Djeparov converted a spot kick two minutes later to move the Uzbeks three points clear at the top and a step closer to their first finals.
Bosnian-born striker Aleksandar Duric scored his third qualifying goal to help Singapore see off Lebanon 2-0 in the other Group 4 match.
South Korea were held to a surprise 0-0 draw by archrivals North Korea in a politically-charged Group 3 qualifier played in Shanghai after a row over flags and national anthems.
The draw humbled South Korea, Asia's most successful World Cup team, but the point was enough to stay top on goal difference ahead of their northern rivals.
Turkmenistan were beaten 2-0 at home by Jordan in the other Group 3 game.
Oman struck after just 26 seconds to condemn Thailand to their second successive defeat and all but rule out their chance of reaching their first World Cup.
Seconds after the kick off, Ismail Al Ajmi broke free in the area to convert a right-wing cross to defeat a resilient Thai side who failed to find the net in more than a dozen clear-cut chances.
This has been a big boost to our chances of World Cup qualification, Oman's Uruguayan coach Julio Cesar Ribas told reporters.
The visitors soaked up 89 minutes of constant pressure from the Thais, with goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi fending off a barrage of attacks from strikers Teerathep Winothai and Teerasin Dangda.
It was a very difficult game
We were under pressure all the time, but we did just enough to win, Al Habsi told Reuters.
In the all-Middle East Group 5, in-form part-timers Syria earned a 1-1 draw with Gulf champions the United Arab Emirates.
Iran entered their ninth month without a win, despite going two up inside the first five minutes through Alireza Vahedi and Seyed Hosseini.
Ahmad Al Azemi pulled one back for Kuwait just before halftime and Fahad Alrashidi levelled on 81 minutes.
Qatar defeated Asian champions Iraq 2-0 in Doha on Wednesday to move back into the reckoning in the Asian zone World Cup Group One qualifiers.
Qatar, the Asian Games champions, found a matchwinner in Brazilian-born midfielder Fabio Montesin, who secured the points with goals in the first and 65th minutes.
Iraq were shocked by the goal after 58 seconds.
Montesin worked the ball up on the right and let fly a 20-metre shot which sailed past Iraq goalkeeper Hassan Noor, who was challenged by Qatar's Uruguayan-born striker Sebastian Soria.
Iraq failed to recover and Qatar controlled the game, keeping possession for long periods with some clever passing.
The second followed a melee inside the Iraq box following a free kick by Qatar striker Marcio Emerson.
The naturalised Brazilian struck a low shot through a packed area and Montesin got the better of two defenders before finding the back of the net with an opportunist strike.
Qatar's Uruguayan coach Jorge Fossati opted for the more offensive 4-3-3 format with Soria, Emerson and the Europe-based Hussain Yasser up front and the trio of Montesin, Talal Al Balosuhi and Wesam Rezak manning the midfield.
Iraq's hopes rested on striker Younis Mahmoud.
But the key figure in their Asian Cup triumph was starved of passes and was also tightly marked by the Qatar defenders.
Qatar had lost their first group match 3-0 to Australia while Iraq were held to a 1-1 draw by China.
Australia top the group with four points after their 0-0 draw with China on Wednesday.
Qatar are second with three points, China have two and Iraq one.
Russian Nikolay Davydenko cruised into the semi-finals of the ATP Sony Ericsson Open on Thursday by defeating Serb Janko Tipsarevic 6-2, 6-1 on the main stadium court.
The 26-year-old Davydenko is off to a career best 17-5 start this season.
He became the first Russian man to reach the final four in the 24-year history of the event.
The world No. 5 had little trouble as he fired nine aces and converted five of six breaks points in dispatching the 23-year-old Tipsarevic in 72 minutes.
Davydenko is still looking to reach his first final, but the win assures an all-top 10 semi-finals here for the first time since 1988.
Davydenko, the world number four, will face the winner of a match between world number one Roger Federer and American Andy Roddick for a place in the final.
The other semi-final will see Spaniard Rafael Nadal square off against Czech Tomas Berdych.
Federer and Roddick have played 16 times in their career dating to 2001 and the Swiss superstar owns a commanding 15-1 series lead, including 11 consecutive wins.
The 26-year-old Federer has not gone this deep into a season without a title since 2000.
Federer has enjoyed past success here, winning back-to-back titles from 2005-06 and finishing as runner-up in 2002,He carries a 30-7 overall mark at this hardcourt event into his match with Roddick, who has won just six of 43 sets played in the series.
Roddick, the 2004 champion, did not play a seeded player en route to his fifth quarter-final in nine career appearances here.
The 25-year-old American has enjoyed a solid season thus far, with an 18-3 mark and titles in San Jose and Dubai.
Defending champion Serena Williams advanced to the final of the WTA Sony Ericsson Open here Thursday, rallying for a 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over Russian third seed Svetlana Kuznetsova.
The 26-year-old American, an eight-time Grand Slam champion, will try to defend her title Saturday against the winner of a later semi-final between Serbian fourth seed Jelena Jankovic and Russia's Vera Zvonareva.
Williams, who needed two hours, 46 minutes to subdue Kuznetsova, improved to 13-1 this year and will seek the 30th singles title of her career, and her fifth Miami title, having captured the crown here in 2002, 2003, 2004 and last year.
Williams was ousted in the Australian Open quarter-finals by Jankovic but bounced back to win her first title of the year at Bangalore.
I'm not 100 percent happy with the way I played today, said Williams, who was far less dominant than she was in beating world number one Justine Henin in the quarter-finals.
I mean, I'm glad I won, but I feel like I could have done a lot better.
I'm just going to try to make little adjustments.
Williams, who converted just five of 16 breakpoint chances, also had treatement after tweaking her back early in the match.
I just got stuck, like out of nowhere I just got stuck, the American said, adding that after the physio worked on her it improved.
Once she came out it got better straightaway, and it got even better after that, Williams said.
The players also were given a heat break during the match because of the steamy conditions.
I do think it was about being mentally tough and making the right shots at the right time and just never giving up, Williams said.
I played a really good opponent today who has been down several match points in this tournament already, so I knew going in she wasn't just going to give it to me.
The 2006 champion of this event, Kuznetsova was attempting to reach her third final in as many events, having finished as runner-up at Dubai and Indian Wells.
Jankovic is 0-3 in semi-final matches this season.
The Serbian, who admits that she has been sick this week, caught a break Wednesday when No. 10 Elena Dementieva - trailing 6-1, 3-1 - retired from their quarter-final match with a shoulder injury.
Jankovic, was just 3-5 in five prior appearances at this event and had never been beyond the third round.
Zvonareva, who defeated No. 13 Dinara Safina in straight sets Wednesday, has split four meetings with Jankovic.
The 23-year-old Russian already has reached two finals this season, most recently finishing as runner-up to Maria Sharapova at Doha.
Zvonareva also advanced to the championship match at the Tier IV Hobart tournament in January, but conceded a walkover win to Eleni Daniilidou after spraining her left ankle in practice.
Roger Federer saved two match points before suffering only his second career loss to Andy Roddick as the persistent American posted a win at the Miami Masters on Thursday.
Federer's record dropped to 15-2 against the American who had not beaten him since summer, 2003.
Roddick stunned the top seed to reach a semi-final against Russian Nikolay Davydenko, who beat Serb Janko Tipsarevic 6-2, 6-1.
Roddick relied in 17 aces as he upset the odds against the 12-time Grand Slam champion who has yet to win a title this season.
Roddick won the opening set in a tiebreaker with Federer then levelling at a set apiece.
In the third, Roddick's never-say-die fight paid dividends with a break for 5-3 and a long-sought victory three points later.
Federer's win streak against Roddick was stopped at 11 straight, identical to his run over LLeyton Hewitt and Davydenko.
Australia will play Ghana in a friendly in Sydney on May 23, Football Federation Australia.
The Socceroos will also take on China in a World Cup qualifying match in Sydney on June 22.

The Chicago Bulls took advantage of an ailing LeBron James to claw their way back from a 17-point deficit and beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 101-98 on Thursday.
James scored 32 points in the first three quarters but suffered back spasms in the fourth.
He managed to score only one point in the final quarter as the Bulls roared back to secure the win over the playoff-bound Cavs.
It just started to spasm, James told reporters.
If you ask anybody how bad that is for me, being the explosive player I am, it's tough to do some of the things I wanted to do, especially in the fourth quarter.
Hopefully I can try to get it better and get it ready for Saturday.
Chicago's Larry Hughes, acquired from the Cavaliers on Feb. 21, scored 25 points, eight rebounds and nine assists on his return to Cleveland.
Ben Gordon scored 24 points, including five late free throws, while Luol Deng and Andres Nocioni both had 15.
The Bulls said they were not about to quit despite a season of disappointment.
The whole season we're pros, let's act like pros and conduct ourselves in that matter and I thought tonight we really showed that, said Bulls interim coach Jim Boylan.
Zydrunas Ilgauskas added 23 points for the Cavaliers.
You got to give that team credit, Cleveland coach Mike Brown said of the Bulls.
That team did a heck of a job in the fourth quarter against us.
It's frustrating for me.
We were up by 17 points late and we had plenty of opportunities to put the game away.
Energie Cottbus prevailed 1-0 at MSV Duisburg on Friday night and with the first away win of the season got a big boost in their relegation battle.
Albanian striker Ervin Skela scored the winner with a diving header five minutes into the match as Cottbus claimed their third win in four matches - including a stunning 2-0 victory over leaders Bayern Munich last month.
Things are going well right now.
We already showed against Munich that we can match every team in the league.
Today's win was very important.
The early goal helped us, but we were very lucky as well.
We must now confirm this form in the next games, said Skela.
Duisburg, who had upset Werder Bremen last weekend, had several chances to get the equalizer, most notably on a freekick from Ivica Grlic in the 78th minute.
Duisburg remained in the drop zone in 16th place with 22 points, while Cottbus are now 14th with 26 points.
The other eight matches are Saturday and Sunday.
Munich, who lead by seven points, host mid-table VfL Bochum, while second-placed SV Hamburg face a difficult match at holders VfB Stuttgart.
Two early Bafetimbi Gomis goals helped St Etienne move up to fifth place in Ligue 1 with a 2-0 home win over strugglers Racing Lens on Wednesday.
Forward Gomis struck twice in the first 15 minutes under heavy rain to bring his season's tally to 13 league goals.
He first netted a powerful long-range shot on 13 minutes and doubled the advantage two minutes later, following up after an effort by Geoffrey Dernis was saved by Lens goalkeeper Vedran Runje.
St Etienne are on 46 points from 32 games and can still dream of winning a place in Europe.
Lens are 17th in the 20-strong league and hold the last safe spot with six games left but are out of the relegation zone only on goal difference.
France's Australian Open finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was on Wednesday ruled out of this weekend's Davis Cup quarter-final against the USA because of a right knee injury.
Tsonga, who beat world number two Rafael Nadal in the Aussie Open semi-finals before losing to Novak Djokovic in the final, has been replaced by Arnaud Clement for the tie that gets underway here on Friday.
Tsonga felt pain in his right knee which was similar to the pain he felt playing doubles in Miami last week, said the French Tennis Federation .
Clement will team up with Michael Llodra in the doubles while Richard Gasquet and Paul-Henri Mathieu will play the singles rubbers.
Andy Roddick and James Blake will play singles for the USA while brothers Mike and Bob Bryan will play doubles.
This will be the 15th meeting in history between France and the USA with the French having won the last encounter in the 2002 semi-finals at Roland Garros.
The two countries split their 14 previous meetings with seven wins each.
They have faced each other nine times in the Davis Cup final.
The USA will be captained by Patrick McEnroe while Guy Forget will guide the French team.
Twice grand slam winner Amelie Mauresmo overcame a first-set wobble to defeat Agnieszka Radwanska 3-6 7-5 7-6 and reach the quarter-finals of the Amelia Island Championships on Thursday.
Mauresmo, seeded 11th, successfully landed 86 percent of her first serves in the opening set but her Polish opponent was able to record the only service break.
The 28-year-old Frenchwoman recovered in the second set and won the third-set tiebreak over the seventh seeded Radwanska 8-6.
In the quarters, Mauresmo will face the winner of the match later on Thursday between second seed Anna Chakvetadze and Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia.
Favourites Bayern Munich scraped through to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup after a heart-stopping extra-time away goals win over Getafe on Thursday.
Getafe played all but six minutes of the game with 10 men but looked to be heading for a famous victory.
Only for Bayern to twice come back from the dead first to force the game into extra time and then to snatch an equaliser to level the match 3-3.
Midfielder Cosmin Contra put Getafe ahead with a virtuoso solo goal just before halftime, but just as the home fans were celebrating a memorable upset Bayern midfielder Franck Ribery equalised in the 88th minute.
Getafe went for broke at the start of extra time and goals from midfielder Francisco Casquero and substitute Braulio put them 3-1 up within three minutes.
But striker Luca Toni pulled a goal back for Bayern late in the second period and struck again at the death to end Getafe's dreams and secure his side a semi-final showdown against Zenit St Petersburg.
I have to compliment Getafe and Laudrup as they played a great game and were on the point of humiliating us.
They were the best team tonight, said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
Getafe coach Michael Laudrup said his team was desperately disappointed at the cruel manner of their exit.
It is difficult to pick ourselves up after this but life goes on and after a couple of days the team will realise that they did something incredible out there, said the Dane.
The game at the Coliseo got off to a frantic start with Bayern almost going ahead inside the first minute when Toni had a close-range shot cleared off the line.
Getafe suffered a setback five minutes later when influential defender Ruben De la Red was sent off for bringing down Bayern striker Miroslav Klose as he bore down on goal
The home side were dealt another blow when Nigeria striker Ikechukwu Uche pulled a hamstring as he tried to chase a long kick up field and was replaced by centre back David Belenguer.
Getafe weathered the storm, however, and took a shock lead just before the break when Contra picked the ball up on the halfway line, cut between two defenders and lashed a fierce shot high into the net.
Visiting Bayern fans reacted violently to the goal by tearing up seats at one end of the stadium before they were quelled by the police.
Getafe should have extended their lead midway through the second half when substitute Braulio sprinted clear and rounded Oliver Kahn only to slip over on the wet turf as he lined up his shot.
They had several more chances to extend their lead late in the second half and paid the price when Ribery snapped home just over a minute from time to force extra time.
Instead of wilting in the face of the disappointment, Getafe piled forward into attack at the start of extra time
Casquero restored the home side's lead with a wonderful strike from the edge of the area and Braulio hit a third almost straight from the restart.
But Bayern were thrown a lifeline five minutes from the end when Getafe keeper Roberto Abbondanzieri dropped a Mark van Bommel cross at the feet of Toni and the Italian striker fired in from close range.
With time running out keeper Kahn piled forward into the opposition area, disrupted the Getafe defence as he got a touch on the ball and Toni headed in to earn his side a remarkable comeback win.
Striker Luca Toni scored twice late in extra time against Getafe on Thursday to spare Bayern Munich's blushes and send the four-times European champions into a UEFA Cup semi-final with Zenit St Petersburg.
The Italian's double strike put favourites Bayern through on away goals after a thrilling 3-3 draw in Spain against a Getafe side who, despite the early dismissal of defender Ruben De la Red, had looked on course to continue a fine first season in European competition.
Bayern now take on Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg, the only team left in the competition never to have won a major European trophy.
Zenit eased through 4-2 on aggregate against Bayer Leverkusen, despite losing their home leg 1-0 on Thursday.
Prolific Romania striker Adrian Mutu sent Fiorentina, losing finalists in 1990, into a last four meeting with Rangers after his double strike sealed a 2-0 away win at PSV Eindhoven for a 3-1 aggregate success.
Rangers won 2-0 in Lisbon against Sporting after a goalless first leg in Glasgow.
Bayern had French winger Franck Ribery, as well as Toni, to thank for their lifeline.
Trailing to Cosmin Contra's late first-half goal at the Coliseo, Ribery struck just over a minute from time.
Then, in a thrilling extra period, Getafe took a 3-1 lead with strikes from Francisco Casquero and Braulio.
Bayern were given hope five minutes from the end when Getafe keeper Roberto Abbondanzieri dropped a Mark van Bommel cross at the feet of Toni and he fired in from close range.
With time running out keeper Oliver Kahn piled forward into the opposition area, disrupted the Getafe defence as he got a touch on the ball and Toni headed in to earn his side a remarkable comeback win.
Rangers have already won the Scottish League Cup this season and are in pole position to reclaim the league title from arch rivals Celtic.
Their victory over Sporting, with second-half goals from Jean-Claude Darchville and Steven Whittaker, was somewhat tarnished by yellow cards for captain Barry Ferguson and fellow midfielder Kevin Thomson which will rule them out of the semi-final first leg at Ibrox on April 24 through suspension.
Fiorentina will also be without midfielder Marco Donadel through suspension for the opening leg.
Two well taken goals from Mutu gave the Florence side a deserved win in Eindhoven.
Mutu struck with a free kick late in the first half and sealed the tie with a fine curling finish on 53 minutes.
The important thing is to have gone through but then I am very happy with my goals, especially the first which was really great, Mutu told La7 television.
We are proud of being the last Italian side in Europe and now we will try and go to the end.
Zenit could not replicate their exhilarating display in Germany last week but did enough at their Petrovsky stadium to reach the last four for the first time.
Russia striker Dmitri Bulykin gave Leverkusen some hope after their first-leg drubbing with an 18th-minute header but the German side's challenge petered out.
Zenit wasted the chance to secure a draw on the night when Anatoliy Tymoschuk's tame 85th-minute penalty was comfortably saved by Rene Adler.
India's Jeev Milkha Singh was in upbeat mood after ending Thursday's first round at the U.S. Masters three shots off the early pace.
The Chandigarh native, who became the first Indian to play at Augusta National Golf Club last year in the opening major of the season, birdied three of the four par-fives on his way to a one-under-par 71.
I drove the ball very well and hit it to the right places, the 36-year-old told reporters.
A few mistakes I think you're allowed on this course and I'm pretty pleased with my round.
I had a few chances but these greens are tough.
You can't be too aggressive out there.
I left some short but I'm still happy with one under par today.
Singh, who tied for 37th on his Masters debut last year, set the tone for a solid round by rolling in a 20-footer to save par on the opening hole.
That got me going, said the 2006 Asian Tour number one, who mixed four birdies with three bogeys on a soft Augusta layout playing extra long.
British Open champion Padraig Harrington of Ireland carded a 74 and Canada's Mike Weir, winner of the 2003 Masters, a 73.
It's the best score in five rounds for me here at Augusta National, Singh said.
Under par on this course is always good.
I'll try to do the same tomorrow and maintain my process and routine.
India's Sania Mirza will undergo wrist surgery later on Thursday, her representatives said. 
The world number 31 has struggled with the problem for over a year and will undergo arthroscopy in Miami, they said in a statement.
Mirza, the only Indian player to win a WTA tour event, is expected to be out of action for a month.
The Asia number one has struggled with a series of injuries and was sidelined for two months following knee surgery in March 2007.
Nigeria named Shaibu Amodu on Thursday as head coach of the national team two months after German manager Bertis Vogts left following a poor African Nations Cup performance in Ghana.
Amodu, who is returning to the job after two previous stints in 1996 and 2000, has a mandate to qualify Nigeria for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and the African Cup of Nations in Angola, the FA said.
Amodu will be assisted by former internationals Daniel Amokachi, an assistant coach at domestic league champions Enyimba, Alloy Agu, Enyimba's goalkeeping trainer and Fatai Amoo manager of premier league side Sunshine Stars.
They must qualify the Super Eagles for the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup and must excel in both championships, Nigeria FA chairman Abdullahi Sani Lulu said.
Amodu's last time in charge was in 2002 when he qualified the Super Eagles for the World Cup finals.
He was fired less than four months before the start of soccer's biggest tournament after Nigeria, a twice African Nations Cup winner and favourite to win the continent's top prize in Mali, finished a disappointing third.
Amodu's first game will be in June when Nigeria play South Africa in a World Cup qualifier.
An envoy of the International Automobile Federation, Piero Sadono, during a visit to Makassar on April 7-10, promised to support the city's candidacy in the 2008-2009 period to host the World Rally Championship in 2010 as well as the event's organization.
Mr Piero Sodano will assist Indonesia for two years to prepare the nation as candidate host in meeting all the requirements for the organization of the rally, Solihin Jusuf Kalla, president director of BMI, the event's promoter, said in a statement here on Friday.
The target, he said, was to make Indonesia the best host country for the series of competitions for the Asia Pacific Rally Championship 2008 and improve its capabilities in 2009 and later be ready to host the WRC 2010.
Kevin Kuranyi hit four goals to help Schalke 04 end a traumatic seven-day spell with a 5-0 rout of Energie Cottbus in the Bundesliga on Tuesday.
Schalke, who sacked coach Mirko Slomka on Sunday after losing 5-1 to Werder Bremen and going out to Barcelona in the Champions League, stayed third in the table thanks to a virtuoso display from Germany striker Kuranyi.
Victory kept them within two points of second-placed Werder, who clinched a 2-1 win at Hansa Rostock when Ivan Klasnic turned in the rebound after Naldo's penalty was saved.
Bayern Munich, who visit Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday, lead with 60 points from 28 games and are on course for a 21st league title.
Werder have 53 points from 29, with Schalke on 51 in the third and final Champions League slot.
Hamburg SV, fourth on 48 points, also missed a late penalty as they drew 0-0 at Hertha Berlin.
Schalke made the most of a large slice of luck in the 31st minute against Cottbus.
Marcelo Bordon's header from a free kick was going nowhere until Vragel da Silva inexplicably diverted it into his own net.
Kuranyi, whose place in Germany's squad has been called into question during a disappointing season, then took over the first match under caretaker coaches Mike Bueskens and Youri Mulder.
The 26-year-old prodded in a Fabian Ernst cross before blasting the third goal with a right-footer from the edge of the area four minutes before the break.
Kuranyi completed his hat-trick just before the hour and rounded off the scoring with a header from Rafinha's cross 10 minutes from time.
I'm delighted to score so many goals but this was all about the team performance, he told reporters.
It was only because we played so well that I was able to score so many.
Werder had to work hard to maintain their two-point advantage in second spot.
Torsten Frings gave them the lead with a 25-metre shot that went in off the post in the 57th minute.
Sebastian Haehnge equalised in the 76th but Frings won a penalty with eight minutes to go and Klasnic spared Naldo's blushes when he raced in to convert after a good save from the keeper.
France striker Karim Benzema sent Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon into the French Cup semi-finals on Tuesday with a 1-0 home win over Metz.

The 20-year-old Benzema collected the ball inside the area with his back to the goal and swiftly turned around to score the winner six minutes from the break.
Metz, bottom of Ligue 1 and already relegated, fought bravely and created many chances with a powerful shot by substitute forward Daniel Gygax forcing a superb save from Gregory Coupet with 10 minutes left.
A late Roy Contout goal gave Amiens a 1-0 win over Ligue 2 rivals Dijon in earlier quarter-final action.
The striker scored from the edge of the box with two minutes remaining.

Woods hopes to recover in time to compete in the US Open at San Diego, June 12-15.
Spain's MotoGP leader Jorge Lorenzo said on Tuesday he was willing to ride with just one good arm at the next race in China on May 4.
The 20-year-old - who recorded his first career victory in the Portuguese MotoGp on Sunday in only his third race at that level - underwent an operation on Monday on a muscle in his right forearm.
On leaving the hospital Lorenzo - who is level on 61 points with compatriot Dani Pedrosa in the standings - told the waiting media that he was prepared to ride in the Shanghai race even if only one arm was operational.
Former world number one Amelie Mauresmo will make her return for France in their Fed Cup World Grup play-off in Tokyo from April 26-27.
France captain Georges Goven has also selected Alize Cornet, Virginie Razzano and Nathalie Dechy for the tie.
The line-up does not include French number one Marion Bartoli, who refuses to play Fed Cup, and Tatiana Golovin, who is recovering from hip surgery.
Mauresmo was called up for the first round tie in China in February but opted to concentrate on her individual game after a lengthy injury-affected slump.
Amelie always said that it was exceptional that she did not play the match against China.
She has always been impeccable leader in this team, a model teammate, said Goven.
The two teams have met seven times, most recently in last year's first round in Limoges, when the French won 5-0 for the loss of just one set.
Since they first meeting in 1965, Japan have won just once against the two-time champions.
Portugal's 2004 Champions League winners FC Porto signed Cape Verde defender Rolando Jorge Pires da Fonseca on a four year contract on Tuesday from rivals Belenenses.

Former world doubles number one Ai Sugiyama will lead Japan's bid for Fed Cup victory against France, as the teams vie for a place in the elite World Group next season, officials said Wednesday.
Sugiyama, currently ranked 38 in singles, will join Akiko Morigami, Aiko Nakamura and Ayumi Morita for the tie on the hard courts of Tokyo's Ariake Coliseum, the Japan Tennis Assocation said.
Sugiyama skipped the World Group II first round tie against Croatia in February, saying she wanted to concentrate on winning enough points to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.
We have the same feeling that we can beat France.
We lost to France last year, so I really want to avenge that loss, Sugiyama was quoted by coach Minoru Ueda as saying.
Sugiyama, who reached a career-high of number eight in the world rankings in February 2004 and also reached the top women's doubles ranking in October 2000, lost two singles matches and a doubles clash in a 5-0 defeat for Japan in the World Group last year in Limoges, France.
Morigami, who won her first tour singles title in Prague last year, is currently ranked 51, Nakamura 81 and Morita 99.
The pair of Sugiyama and Morita is the best choice.
All the four players can play the singles.
We still have time.
I'm going to choose the singles players at the last moment, said Ueda.
France, two-time Fed Cup winners, on Tuesday named former world number one Amelie Mauresmo, up-and-coming Alize Cornet, Nathalie Dechy, and Virginie Razzano, who shocked Venus Williams in the final to win the Japan Open in October.

Getafe, who lost to Sevilla in last season's final, were thrown a lifeline when Esteban Granero scored from the spot on the stroke of halftime.
The goal gave Michael Laudrup's team a new lease of life and they put their opponents under severe pressure in the second half but it was Valencia who struck again, substitute Fernando Morientes heading in with seven minutes left.
The night ended on a low note for Getafe when midfielder Fabio Celestini was sent off just before the final whistle.
Luca Toni struck twice to help Bayern Munich secure a 3-1 comeback win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday to take a big step closer to their 21st German league title.
Bayern fell behind to a Benjamin Koehler goal in the first half but a Daniel van Buyten header and Toni's 19th and 20th Bundesliga goals of the season saw the Bavarians home.
Victory restored Bayern's 10-point lead at the top of the table and with only five matches left it looks a question of when rather than if they will clinch the title.
Werder Bremen are second on 53 points after winning 2-1 at Hansa Rostock on Tuesday while Schalke 04 are in the third and final Champions League slot on 51 following their 5-0 victory over Energie Cottbus.
Hamburg SV, who drew 0-0 at Hertha Berlin on Tuesday, are fourth on 48 points, ahead of VfB Stuttgart on goal difference after the outgoing champions won 3-0 at home to bottom club Nuremberg on Wednesday.

Top seed and holder Jelena Jankovic weathered a tight first set before crushing American qualifier Alexandra Stevenson 7-5 6-0 in the Family Circle Cup second round on Wednesday.
After initially struggling to cope with Stevenson's unconventional backhand, the 23-year-old Serb took control to wrap up victory in one hour 22 minutes.
Her backhand was really good and I kept hitting to her backhand which was wrong, world number five Jankovic told reporters.
That's what happens when you don't know the player well but then I found my way.
I saw how she was playing, her strengths and weaknesses and I was able to play the tactics a lot better.
Jankovic, runner-up to Serena Williams at this month's Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, next meets Russian Anastasia Rodionova, a 6-3 6-4 winner against Aravane Rezai of France.
I played her here last year and I thought that was a very easy match, said Jankovic, who is playing on clay for the first time this season.
But every match is different.
I'm just trying to get my timing and trying to see how to play on clay.
It's a different game and you have to really know how to move well.

Benfica equalised again three minutes later with a long-range effort by Uruguayan midfielder Cristian Rodriguez.
Sporting made sure of their 25th appearance in the final with goals by Djalo in the 85th minute and Montenegrin Simon Vukcevic in stoppage time.
Former Portuguese international striker Pedro Pauleta saved ailing French football giants once again on Wednesday as he came off the bench to score the only goal in a 1-0 win and end lower league side Carquefou's dreams of French Cup glory.
The 34-year-old marksman has been the standout player for the Parisian outfit this season - which hasn't been hard as they fight against relegation - and his goal gives them hopes of at least achieving a cup double this term, having won the League Cup earlier this season.
PSG lived dangerously though after establishing their lead and Carquefou should have levelled four minutes from time but somehow PSG 'keeper Jerome Alonzo blocked the ball at close range three times.
Whilst Carquefou may feel hard done by as they certainly penetrated the PSG area on several occasions, the team made up of students, bankers and even a barman can rest on their laurels having eliminated Marseille in the previous round and have earned around 600,000 euros for their exploits - their budget for this season was only 500,000.
Pauleta, though, rested determined that the Cup was a distraction.
Cup matches are very difficult to play and to score in, said Pauleta, Staying in the top division remains the priority, and its good for the morale.
Bordeaux's hopes of the domestic double came crashing to earth earlier on Wednesday when they lost to Second Division Sedan - finalists of the competition in 2005 - on penalties after the match finished 0-0 following extra-time.
Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc, whose side trail leaders Lyon by four points with five matches remaining, called on his side to rebound straight away from the reverse.
When we play three matches in a week, it is the third that worries me the most.
Therefore from Thursday we have to regroup, I hope that the boys are going to come out of this accepting that it was just a blip.
His Sedan counterpart Jose Pasqualetti can by contrast dream of a perfect end to his two years in charge of the 'Wild Boars' as he announced after the match that he was going to resign at the end of the campaign despite being offered a new contract.
I have a wife I love, I have children and a grandchild who I adore and I miss my family, the 51-year-old said.
I work in a fabulous sport, an extraordinary one that allows me to earn a 
living but in life, there is not only money, there is also a family, added the Corsican.
Lyon had unlike Bordeaux on Tuesday remained on for the domestic double when they edged First Division tailenders Metz 1-0.
 French striker Karim Benzema scoring with a brilliant piece of skill inside the penalty area in the 52nd minute.
Benzema, though, was frank about what remained the top priority of the club, that once again failed to deliver in the Champions League this term.
The French Cup is important to us but we also want to win the seventh league title in a row for the club and remains our priority, said the young talent, who should be one of France's stars at this year's Euro 2008 finals.
I hope of course that we do achieve the double as that is something the club has never done before, he added.
They had been joined on Tuesday in the last four when lower division Amiens beat fellow non championship side Dijon 1-0.
Fifteen-year-old Ryan Harrison has set his sights on an upset victory over fellow American James Blake to keep his dream run alive at this week's U.S. Clay Court Championships.
The qualifier is on course to face the world number nine in Thursday's second round after joining Spaniard Rafael Nadal and Frenchman Richard Gasquet as the only players since 1990 to win ATP matches under the age of 16.
Before that, though, top-seeded Blake must win his opening match against Japanese wildcard Kei Nishikori later on Wednesday.
I feel like I have a good chance, Harrison said of his prospects against Blake, a winner of 10 ATP career titles.
If I play at the level that I played two days ago, then I have a chance for a win.
Texan resident Harrison stunned Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas 6-4 6-3 in Monday's first round, having lost just eight games in qualifying wins over Phillip King and Alex Reichel.
The pressure is on them to win against me I guess, added Harrison, replying to on-line questions on ESPN Sport's Web site.
There isn't a whole lot of pressure on me.
I just go out there and play.
Harrison was delighted to qualify in Houston on his ATP debut.
That was my main goal, he said.
After that, I wanted to play as well as I can.
I always feel I can beat anybody that I play.
I am comfortable on clay so it wasn't something that I was bothered by, Harrison added, referring to his surprise victory over 95th-ranked Cuevas.
I knew it was a match that I could go out there and win so I played as hard as I could.
Aged 15 years, 11 months and seven days, Harrison broke Cuevas three times in the opening set on Monday before sweeping to victory in just under an hour.
It feels really good to have the whole experience and it also feels good to have people looking up to you, he added.
But as much as I'm enjoying this My upcoming goal is to beat my next opponent.
Top seed James Blake eased into the U.S. Clay Court Championships second round but fellow American Sam Querrey, the fourth seed, made an early exit on Wednesday.
Blake, the world number nine, beat Japanese wildcard Kei Nishikori 6-4 6-4 in an evening match to set up a meeting with 15-year-old American Ryan Harrison on Thursday.
Harrison had stunned Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas 6-4 6-3 in Monday's first round to join Spaniard Rafael Nadal and Frenchman Richard Gasquet as the only players since 1990 to win ATP matches under the age of 16.
Big-serving Querrey squandered a 2-0 lead in the decisive set before losing 5-7 6-4 6-4 to Chilean Nicolas Massu in a tight contest lasting two hours, 48 minutes.
Massu, making his third appearance at an event where he reached the final on his debut in 2000, broke back twice in the third set to secure victory.
I played well and it could have gone either way, Querrey, 20, told reporters.
It was a tough match.
I didn't serve my best but, other than that, it was pretty good.
I'm not too disappointed, added the towering American who clinched his first ATP title at last month's Las Vegas Open.
Massu, 28, next faces Brazil's Marcos Daniel, a 6-3 6-4 winner over Serb Viktor Troicki.

With three matches to play, fifth-placed Everton have 61 points, five behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
The only goal of a dour match came with Chelsea's first shot on target after 41 minutes.
Shaun Wright-Phillips's reverse pass into the box was deflected into Essien's path and the Ghanaian midfielder chested the ball down before lifting it over goalkeeper Tim Howard.
Essien was also on target in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge on Monday, when a late Wigan equaliser dented Chelsea's title aspirations.
Chelsea manager Avram Grant made five changes from Monday, but Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba were both out of the side, Lampard for family reasons and Drogba through injury.
Chelsea were still a little too sharp for Everton, but although they stretched their unbeaten league run to 18 matches, Chelsea will fail in their title bid if United win their next two matches at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea.
Neither side produced much of note and Everton rarely threatened to score as they bid to beat Chelsea for the first time in 20 matches dating back to May 2001.
Everton manager David Moyes told his club's Web site afterwards he was disappointed with the result.
We didn't play well enough to take anything out of the game, he said.
You never want to lose a goal but before the break it makes it a little bit more difficult.
It's hard to get goals against them.
The match was moved to Thursday to suit TV schedules and Chelsea paid for their fans' tickets and travel costs for making the journey to Merseyside.

Former champion Justin Leonard made the most of ideal conditions and a relaxed frame of mind to charge into a share of the lead at the Heritage Classic in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina on Thursday.
Four days after battling gusting winds to tie for 20th at the U.S. Masters, Leonard fired a sparkling five-under-par 66 to set the first-round pace with fellow Americans Lucas Glover and five-times winner Davis Love III.
American Stewart Cink, the 2004 champion, was a further stroke adrift along with nine others, including compatriots Anthony Kim, John Rollins and Charles Howell III, plus Colombia's Camilo Villegas.
It was a nice day, and wonderful weather-wise, Leonard, 35, told reporters after hitting a five-iron to two feet at the last to set up his sixth birdie of the day on the picturesque Harbour Town Golf Links.
It was great to play without a whole lot of wind after last week when you play so defensively.
You come here and play a little more aggressively.
Asked to compare this week's PGA Tour event with the opening major of the year at Augusta National, Leonard replied:
Last week was like final exams and this week is like spring break.
You come here and it's such a relaxed atmosphere.
We go on bike rides and do a lot of fun stuff with the kids.
Golf is almost secondary here.
For me, it's pretty easy to get in the mindset of coming here and kind of leaving some of the baggage from last week behind and get over here, relax and play a great golf course.
Leonard, winner of the 2002 Heritage Classic, said his most significant hole of the round was the par-four 10th where he chipped in to save par.

The former Ferrari driver said on his homepage after the end of test drives in Barcelona Wednesday evening the Italian team had a slight advantage going into the race on April 27.
Three teams - Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes and BMW-Sauber - would be fighting for the championship, which is good for the sport, he said.
Schumacher, a seven-time world champion, has been acting as adviser for Ferrari since retiring at the end of the 2006 season.
On Wednesday he took part in test drives in Ferrari's F2008 car at the Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona.

Renault's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso expressed satisfaction with modifications to his car, which allowed him to record the best time of the week on Wednesday.
But he remained cautious about prospects for the rest of season, noting that the French team was in fourth place in the constructors race, behind Ferrari, McLaren and BMW.
After a poor start to the season, Alonso, who gave way to Piquet for testing on Thursday, recently threatened to quit the team at the end of 2008 unless he had a more competitive car.

The Chicago Bulls sacked interim coach Jim Boylan on Thursday after a disappointing NBA season.
Boylan, who had been an assistant coach since 2004, took over as head coach on Dec. 27 after Scott Skiles was sacked.

Jim was put in a difficult position on Dec. 27, without the luxury of having a training camp and with some of the issues that arose during his time as head coach, said Bulls executive vice president of basketball operations John Paxson in a statement.
I think during the time he coached this year, Jim showed he is very capable in that role and I hope he gets that opportunity again in the future.

Sharapova and Williams came into the match in form.
The Russian last week clinched her first clay court title, beating Dominika Cibulkova in the final on green clay at Amelia Island, while the American also won her last tournament, two weeks ago at Miami.
Sharapova was happy to take the positives from a tough loss the day before her 21st birthday, saying: Considering the success she's had on clay, she was obviously the favourite .
The Russian had a chance to win the first set 6-4 but failed to take it and although she won the second and battled to the end Williams finished much stronger to close out the match.
If I did take that set point or if I had taken a couple of those important points, I would have won the second and the match would been over in two.
So, you know, that's the way it goes and that's the beauty of tennis.

But I was fighting until the end and I won the match.
