"Though we are sad for his loss, he left a legacy that will inflame the enemy nation and religion."
It is speculated that he was hit by a United States missile, which is now identified as being fired from a Predator drone, in the North Waziristan of Pakistan, and a dozen more militants were also reported dead.
"The missile appeared to have been fired by a drone," said a Pakistani intelligence official.
"They do have an ability to regenerate and replace these guys," said a Western intelligence official.
Al-Libi is said to have been the third highest ranking member of al-Qaeda.
The Government of Pakistan said they did not know about his death.
The details of the death have not yet been fully released.
Both teams entered Sunday's match with a seven-game unbeaten streak to give them the chance to take the final playoff spot.
In the end, Chicago Fire beat Los Angeles Galaxy to take the last playoff spot.
Chicago Fire controlled the game as they outshot Los Angeles Galaxy 22-5.
Los Angeles Galaxy recorded just a single shot on goal which came early in the 1st half.
Chicago Fire poured the shots until they scored the winner in the 93rd minute to score the eventual game winner.
The loss for Los Angeles Galaxy eliminates them from the playoffs as Chicago Fire will play DC United in the 1st round of the playoffs.
Although the United States experienced average temperatures for the December, 2006 to February, 2007 period, overall world temperatures were the warmest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
In a March 15, 2007 report, the NOAA indicated that a record warm January helped push the combined global land and ocean surface temperature for the past winter to its highest value since records began in 1880.
The ocean-atmosphere system, El Niño, played a part in the season's record warmth, according to the report's authors, but its effects did not last long, as ocean temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific cooled more than 0.3 degrees C in February and were near average for the month.
The global land-surface temperature was the warmest on record, while the ocean-surface temperature tied for second warmest in the past 128 year period, approximately 0.06 degrees C cooler than the record established during the strong El Niño episode of 1997-1998.
During the past century, global surface temperatures have increased approximately 0.06 degrees C per decade, but since 1976 the rate of increase has been about 0.18 degrees C per decade.
The greatest temperature increase occurred in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.
In an interview with Reuters, Jay Lawrimore of NOAA suggested that the data does not show greenhouse gases had an influence on the recent temperature increases, but acknowledges that by "looking at long-term trends and long-term changes, we are able to better understand natural and anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change."
A U.S. Commerce Department agency based in Washington, D.C., the NOAA conducts research and gathers data on oceans and atmosphere.
The NOAA is a participant in the Group on Earth Observations, GEO, an intergovernmental effort to coordinate the collection of Earth observations worldwide.
Clare Short, the United Kingdom's then-Secretary of State for International Development, appeared before the Iraq Inquiry yesterday, and told the panel that the Cabinet was "misled" about the Iraq War's legality prior to the 2003 invasion.
The three-hour session was held in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London's City of Westminster.
Short, an outspoken critic of the war, retired from the cabinet to become an independent MP two months before the invasion.
She claimed to have been "conned" into staying on despite her doubts about the war and told the inquiry that the Cabinet, of which she was a part, was not a "decision-making body", and that Parliament was simply a "rubber stamp".
In what is becoming an annual phenomenon in France, 400 cars were set ablaze during the New Year's night.
In 2006, an average of 112 cars a day were torched across France.
There were 15 attacks per day on police and emergency services.
Almost 3,000 police officers were injured in clashes with residents.
In four separate ambushes, officers were badly injured in the Paris suburbs since September.
Police speak of open war with youths who are bent on more than vandalism.
Police in Melbourne, Australia are on the hunt for a gunman who killed a man and injured two others in the city's central business district this morning.
Officials warned all office workers to remain indoors, and train services to Flinders Street Station were temporarily on hold, as investigations were carried out on the intersection of Flinders Lane and William Street.
Malcom Bates, who witnessed the shootings at around 8:15 a.m., said the gunman grabbed a woman from inside a taxi.
"The lady got away and he turned and shot three people basically point blank," Mr Bates said.
He said that the incident took no longer than the "wink of an eye".
Paramedics struggled to revive the one victim for almost an hour before declaring him dead at the scene.
The two injured people have been taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a critical condition.
Police believe the incident began at the Bar Code 24-hour bar in King Street, when a woman attempted to get into a taxi.
She was apparently grabbed by the hair by the gunman who then shot her and two men who attempted to come to her aid.
Police have identified the gunman as Christopher Wayne Hudson, aged 29.
They believe him to be a member of the Hells Angels bikie gang.
Police have described Hudson as about 180 cm tall, with short brown hair and wearing a dark tracksuit top and dark denim jeans.
A building worker on a construction site on the corner of Queen and Flinders Streets has reportedly discovered a handgun.
It is understood the gunman may have thrown the weapon into the site as he fled the scene.
Doctors from the Rudolfinerhaus clinic in Vienna say "there is no doubt" Ukrainian opposition leader Victor Yushchenko was poisoned with Dioxin.
Yushchenko's body had about 1,000 times more than the normal concentration of the toxin.
It is unknown if there were any other poisons in his system.
Although it has not yet been proven that the poisoning was deliberate, doctors suspect it was.
"We suspect a cause triggered by a third party," said Michael Zimpfer, head doctor at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic.
He suggested the poison may have been administered orally, through food or drink.
Today's announcements are a follow-up of an earlier press conference, where Dr. Korpan that there were three hypotheses under consideration, one of them involving dioxin.
He did not reveal what the other two hypotheses were.
Dr. Michael Zimpfer, director of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic emphasized that time there was no proof yet to specify the substance causing the illness.
Yushchenko left Kiev on Friday (2004-10-12) for further examination in Vienna.
When Yushchenko fell ill on October 6th, Ukrainian doctors had initially diagnosed food poisoning, leading to speculation that he had been poisoned deliberately.
The illness has disfigured Yushchenko's body and face which doctors say could take up to two years to heal.
He fell seriously ill on the September 6th, during his presidential campaign.
Yushchenko was taken to the Rudolfinerhaus clinic of Vienna, where he stayed for four days under Dr. Korpan's care.
He was diagnosed with "acute pancreatitis, accompanied by interstitial edematous changes."
These symptoms were said to be due to "a serious viral infection and chemical substances which are not normally found in food products" as his campaign officials put it.
In laymans terms, he developed an infection in the pancreas and got a bad skin condition that disfigured his face with cysts and lesions.
The skin condition has similarities with the chloracne associated with dioxin posioning according to a British toxicologist John Henry.
Newly named Prime Minister of France Dominique de Villepin has had his cabinet accepted by President of the Republic Jacques Chirac.
Head of the majority Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party, Nicolas Sarkozy, comes as a second-in-command as Minister of the Interior, with the honorific rank of Minister of State.
The Ministry of the Interior is traditionally one of the most important positions in the cabinet, with that of Finances; the Minister of the Interior is in charge, notably, of law enforcement and relationships with local governments.
There is some uneasiness in having the head of a party in a position that is partly in charge of electoral redistrictings.
Also, this arrangement creates a peculiar situation: it is public knowledge that Villepin and Sarkozy consider each other a dangerous political rival with respect to the 2007 presidential election, and they are widely said to loathe each other.
However, as many as 31 ministers, delegate ministers and secretaries of state were named; still, this is a reduction from the preceding 43.
While the cabinet is for a large part copied from the preceding one, some ministers who had provoked controversy and animosity were removed or moved to another less risky position.
Dominique Perben, who pushed for controversial law which opponents allege curtail fundamental constitutional freedoms while Minister of Justice, was moved to the less sensitive position of Minister of Transportation and Equipment.
It is also possible that the movement of Brigitte Girardin from Minister for the Oversea (relationships with French overseas departments and territories) to (international) Cooperation was motivated by the crisis that occurred in French Polynesia between Gaston Flosse and his opponent Oscar Temaru.
While the Union for French Democracy (UDF) party, led by François Bayrou, formally remains in the ruling coalition along with the UMP, it has decided that, because the new government would probably do more of the same policies, it would not participate in it.
The only member of the government from UDF is Gilles de Robien, as in the preceding government.
Previous head of government Jean-Pierre Raffarin had lost the confidence of the French, with polls putting him as low as 22% confidence.
President Chirac's confidence among the citizenry is also a record low of 24%.
She received 68 percent of the vote after 96 percent of the ballots were tallied.
Turnout in the elections was reported at slightly more than fifty percent.
A candidate must win at least half the vote in order to avoid a run-off election if the turnout is over 50%.
With voter turnout at less than 50%, a candidate needs at least 33% support from all persons eligible to cast a ballot.
I congratulate the Lithuanian people for their choice, she said at her election headquarters.
As reported the United Nations, January 12 Haiti earthquake left exactly 222,570 deaths, 1,300,000 refugees in harbours, 766,000 displaced people, 310,000 injured and 869 disappeared.
The report also mentioned economic loss suffered by the country, that reached 7.754 billion dollars, leaving 71 percent of the Haitians in extreme poverty.
The document was diffused in Santo Domingo de Guzmán, between the preparatives of a conference about the reconstruction of Haiti, that will take place next March 11 in New York.
Haitian Government representatives have asked to donors an additional help of 350 million dollars for the Haiti reconstruction, the most poor country in the Americas.
The damages report was prepared by the Haitian Government with the support of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank, the United Nations and the European Union.
England have beaten India by 104 runs in the first One-Day International of the Indian tour of England at the Rose Bowl, Hampshire, England.
England's batsmen started quietly, reaching 43-1 in the eleventh over when Matt Prior was caught off Zaheer Khan's bowling.
Alastair Cook and Ian Bell shared a 178-run partnership, with Cook reaching his maiden one-day century before being bowled by Yuvraj Singh.
Soon afterwards, Bell reached his first one-day century, and finished the innings on 126 not out.
Kevin Pietersen added 33 runs off 25 balls and England finished their 50 overs with a score of 288-2.
The second ODI will take place at the County Ground, Bristol, on 24 August.
Earlier in the month, India won a three-match Test series 1-0.
Kenya's new Parliament convened for the first time since the country's disputed December 27 election, but politician's on opposing sides took part in a heated discussion over who would be the new speaker of the party.
Kenyan opposition politicians argued with followers of re-elected President Mwai Kibaki over how to pick a new parliamentary speaker.
When a discussion into how the speaker should be decided started, lawmakers with Raila Odinaga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement insisted the election for speaker be held by open ballot; Mr. Kibaki's supporters demanded the vote be secret.
The discussion took place for over an hour politicians from both sides took part in a discussion where anger was clearly shown, before the two parties decided a secret ballot was acceptable.
The standing orders are very clear that members will be given a ballot.
Can you show us where it says secret ballot? 
 We went into election with secret ballot, you stole the vote, we cannot trust you anymore, said William Ruto, a senior adviser for Odigna.
After a first round of voting, the Orange Democratic Movement candidate had a narrow lead, necessitating another ballot.
If no-one gets two-thirds majority after two rounds the speaker will be elected by a simple majority in the third round.
It was an argument like that seen in Parliament that has led many Kenyans to say they have felt abandoned by their leaders in the weeks of chaos that followed the December 27 vote.
Eleven people have died after a military helicopter crashed during an anti-narcotics flight in Western Mexico.
Michoacan is a major area in Mexico's anti-narcotics operations, which are conducted by the nation's military.
Police cordoned off the scene and forensic officers have moved in to examine the site.
There are 11 men dead, including a colonel, and one soldier was injured, said a state attorney general's office spokesman.
The wounded soldier, who was the sole survivor, was flown to a Mexico City military hospital, and remains there in a serious condition.
Although authorities released no crash details, witnesses say the helicopter lost power during attempts to land.
The motor stopped and the helicopter plummeted to the ground, said one local resident named Agustin Vargas.
The flight had been headed to a marijuana field with the intention of raiding it.

A United States Apache military helicopter has been shot down in Baghdad, Iraq says a military spokesman.
Reports say that the chopper went down near the U.S. air base, Taji, located just north of downtown Baghdad.
"I can confirm that we are looking into reports that a helicopter went down north of Baghdad," said Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military.
At least 2 soldiers were on board the aircraft, but their condition is not known.
Witnesses near the scene and police say that at least 2 Apaches were flying together when insurgents began to shoot at the choppers, shooting one of them down and hitting the other, but the helicopter still managed to fly away.
The helicopters were believed to have been escorting a U.S. military convoy on the ground when shots were fired.
"The chopper was swinging around before it hit the ground one kilometer away from me and I heard a big explosion," said local farmer, Hashim Assafi who also said that he had to find shelter as shots were fired in the direction of the helicopters.
In a statement posted on an Al-Qaeda in Iraq website, insurgents claim responsibility for shooting down the helicopter.
"We say to the enemies of God that the sky of the Islamic state of Iraq is forbidden just like its land," said the statement.
This is the fourth helicopter operated by the U.S. military to crash or be shot down in two weeks.
What is believed to be the world's oldest leather shoe, over 5,500 year old, has been found in a cave in Armenia by a team of archaeologists.
The Armenian shoe is in a perfectly preserved condition and is a few hundred years older than the one found on Ötzi the Iceman, making it the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world, and the oldest footwear yet found in Europe.
The leather shoe was found in a cave dubbed Areni-1, near the village of Areni in the Vayots Dzor province of Armenia, on the Iranian and Turkish borders.
"I was amazed to find that even the shoe-laces were preserved," recalled Diana Zardaryan, the Armenian PhD student who made the discovery.
According to researchers, the shoe, made of cow-hide, consists of only one leather piece and was probably customised to the wearer's foot.
It was relatively small, measuring the corresponding to European size 37 or US size 7 women, however, it could have been worn by a man.
It was kept in excellent condition by a thick layer of sheep excrement, which acted as a seal, helping it survive the millennia.
The shoe contained grass, although the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was to used to maintain the shape of the shoe and/or prepare it for storage.
"We thought initially that the shoe and other objects were about 600-700 years old because they were in such good condition," said co-author Dr. Ron Pinhasi from the University College Cork in Ireland.
The shoe and the cave will continue to be researched.
"We do not know yet what the shoe or other objects were doing in the cave or what the purpose of the cave was," said Pinhasi, "We know that there are children's graves at the back of the cave but so little is known about this period that we cannot say with any certainty why all these different objects were found together".
Currently, the oldest known footwear are sandals made from sagebrush bark, found in Fort Rock Cave, Oregon in the United States.
These shoes were discovered in 1938, and have been dated to about 10,000 years before present.
Discoveries within the cave move early bronze-age cultural activity in Armenia back by about 800 years.
Additional discoveries yielded an extensive array of Copper Age artifacts dating to between 6,200 and 5,900 years ago.
On December 22, 2006 Microsoft has announced that it has extended its warranty for all Xbox 360 video game consoles to one year in the United States.
While this one year warranty applies to all Xbox 360 software as well, Xbox 360 accessories will still carry their original 90 day warranty.
"Customers that experience hardware issues with their Xbox 360 within one year of purchase will have their consoles repaired at no cost."
"Moreover, the new warranty policy is retroactive, so consumers that may have already paid for out-of-warranty Xbox 360 repair within one year of the console's purchase will be eligible for reimbursement of their console repair charges."
This extension should help ease customers' minds who have been concerned with the Xbox 360's reputation for hardware failures.
A partial list of hardware issues can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems
People who have paid for Xbox 360 repair will be automatically distributed a reimbursement check in about 10 weeks from the present date.
Previously in September, 2006, Microsoft had waived the cost for repairs on all Xbox 360 consoles made before January 1, 2006, and refunded any fees already paid.
A leak at an offshore oil drilling rig has caused an oil slick off Australia's coast.
According to the rig's operator, it could take weeks to fully plug it.
Gas and oil started leaking from a hole beneath the sea floor on early Friday.
It has caused an oil slick about nine miles long and thirty yards wide．
Officials, however, said that there was no threat to the environment and it was improbable the slick would reach the Australian coast.
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said that "there's no threat to the Australian coast."
"It is evaporating naturally and the work of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will merely assist in that evaporation."
69 people were evacuated from the rig on Friday, amid fears that a fire could start from the condensate oil.
The rig is located approximately 150 miles off the coast of Kimberley.
Two train derailments in two days have closed railway lines in Australia.
A Rio Tinto iron ore train derailled at Pilbara, on a spur of the Tom Price to Dampier line on Thursday 29.
The following day, a freight train with 40 wagons derailed east of Kalgoorlie, injuring three people.
The second derailment has closed the line used by the long distance Sydney to Perth Indian Pacific passenger train.
Operators Great Southern Railway expect to lose A$500,000 revenues as the line remains closed until at least Thursday.
Police say heavy rain has affected the area, and the federal Australian Rail Track Corporation say that a new access road needs to be built in order to clear the wreckage and repair the track.
Rio Tinto have sufficient stocks of iron ore already in place to keep working.
However, the freight train was carrying consumer products, which may run short in the south of Western Australia in the next few days.
The Kalgoorie crash is to be investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, while maintenance company Transfield Services will also be examining the incident.
Eight Hungarian migrant workers sacked from a Domino's Pizza franchise in Derby, England are said to have taken home virtually no pay for months because of illegal deductions.
The claim is refuted by the company who said in a statement "We have begun a thorough investigation during which we have scrutinised the franchisee's employment practices."
"The franchisee concerned is confident that he possesses the evidence required to refute these allegations."
"To the extent that we have been informed of all allegations and have reviewed all available evidence, we also believe this to be the case."
The sacked workers are being supported in their claim by the workers union Unite.
The union say the "there appeared to be a deliberate strategy of keeping the workers in debt to the company through a series of crippling deductions."
"The deductions included payments to cover the contract purchase of a car from their employer, insurance for the vehicle provided through their employer, and exorbitant rent for substandard accommodation, again provided through their employer."
In addition, some workers had to pay fees of up to £180 for an "introduction" to the company.
One worker earned just £5 in four months because of the constant and hefty deductions out of his wage packet.
Spencer Dryden, the drummer of the legendary American rock band Jefferson Airplane, passed away on Tuesday, Jan. 11.
Spencer Dryden was a member of Jefferson Airplane during the band's heyday.
He replaced original drummer Skip Spence and played with Jefferson Airplane at the legendary Woodstock and Altamont rock festivals.
Dryden left the band in 1970 to play with New Riders of The Purple Sage, a country rock band formed by members of the Grateful Dead.
He was married three times and is survived by sons Jeffrey, Jes and Jackson Dryden.
The National Weather Service announced that some 27 inches of snow was measured at 4:10 p.m. EST at Central Park in New York City today, breaking a record set in 1947.
This after a day of snowfall and storms in the Northeastern United States.
The poor weather conditions prompted the shutdown of LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark International Airports.
Delta Airlines also canceled flights in and out of Washington, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Providence, and Hartford.
In Massachusetts, heavy snow and blizzard warnings were in effect as visibility had been greatly hindered by the falling snow.
There were other reports of near-blizzard conditions in parts of Connecticut, and Rhode Island.
Adding to the storm, wind gusts as high as 60 mph in New England prompted concerns over coastal flooding.
In New York City, Department of Transportation employees worked a twelve-hour overtime shift to salt and plow the snow from streets and highways.
Alternate-side of the street parking regulations are suspended, but not the city's public schools, much to the chagrin of New York's children.
Although the streets are navigable, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) is a different story: Service between Jamaica and Penn Stations remains suspended, as is service along the Port Washington and Hempstead branches.
Additionally, all running branches are expected to be running with 30 minute delays.
The MTA Subways will cross-honor LIRR tickets, so customers will be able to take the E train from Jamaica instead.
A collaboratively-developed operating system kernel known as GNU Hurd has been made bootable using the L4 microkernel, which provides room for significant speed improvements over an existing implementation using the Mach microkernel.
The newer architecture also has a more lively developer community.
Developer Marcus Brinkmann made the historic step and finished the process initialization code, which enabled him to execute the first software on Hurd-L4.
In a message to the L4 port of GNU Hurd mailing list, Brinkmann wrote, "We can now easily explore and develop the system in any way we want."
"With my glibc port, I can already build simple applications, but most won't run because they need a filesystem or other gimmicks (like, uhm, fork and exec), and I only have stubs (dummy functions which always return an error) for that now," he added in a later posting.
Compared with Linux and BSD Unix's monolithic kernel architecture, a microkernel based operating system provides developers greater modularity and isolation from hardware, a big win with L4 already being available for a large number of hardware varieties.
There is a cost in speed for such abstraction, and this cost was higher on Mach, at around 15%, compared with only around 5% on L4 and it's predecessor L3, both developed by Dr. Jochen Liedtke.
The greater modularity and abstraction of a microkernel approach means that the microkernel itself does not need constant modification as is seen in the Linux kernel today, since it provides only the very minimum of services, and does so very carefully.
However, the Mach kernel first developed ten years earlier at Carnegie Mellon University is seen as a flawed first implementation, with the lessons learned being implemented in microkernels like L4, known as second-generation microkernels.
The GNU Hurd forms the base of the GNU operating system, much of which has been widely adopted by users of other Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.
The GNU Project has been developing the Hurd since 1983.
In 1990, the GNU Project decided to use the Mach kernel, rather than writing their own.
The Hurd is released as free software under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
The Hurd kernel is an experiment which aims to surpass existing Unix kernels in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with them.
According to the GNU Hurd project, "The Hurd should, and probably will, be ported to other hardware architectures or other microkernels in the future" .
A limited port of Linux already runs on L4, known as L4Linux.
In an appearance on the The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday night, United States President Barack Obama told host, Jay Leno, that he had bowled at the White House bowling alley and scored a 129.
It was like the Special Olympics or something, the President said.
The Special Olympics is an international organization that promotes self-confidence and social skills for people with intellectual disabilities.
It organizes the Special Olympics World Games which is recognized by the International Olympic Committee and is similar to the Paralympic Games which are for people with physical disabilities.
Even before the taped show was aired, Barack Obama called the chairman of the Special Olympics to apologize.
He phoned Timothy Shriver from Air Force One on the way back to Washington, D.C..
Tim Shriver is also the son of Eunice Kennedy Shriver who founded the Special Olympics.
"He expressed his disappointment, and he apologized in a way that was very moving. " 
"He expressed that he did not intend to humiliate this population," Shriver said on Friday in an interview on Good Morning America.
"People with special needs are great athletes and productive citizens."
"The President made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics," White House deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, said.
"He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world."
Meanwhile, Kolan McConiughey, a top Special Olympics bowler told the Associated Press that he doesn't think Obama bowls like a Special Olympian.
McConiughey has five perfect 300 games on his track record as a bowler and averages a score of 212.
"I'd tell him to get a new bowling ball, new shoes and bring him down to the lane," said McConiughey, offering bowling advice to the President.
"Keep his body straight, his arm straight and keep his steps straight". 
Maria Shriver, sister of Tim Shriver, said "The President's comment hurts millions of people throughout the world."
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is married to Maria Shriver, said, "He [Obama] loves Special Olympics, and he would do everything he can to help Special Olympics."
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters, "I know that the President believes that the Special Olympics are a triumph of the human spirit, and I think he understands that they deserve a lot better than — than the thoughtless joke that he made last night".
Two rockets hit the south of Lebanon's capital Beirut today, injuring three or more people.
The rockets landed in a district controlled by the Hezbollah organisation, a Shi'a Islamic militant and political group, with one rocket hitting a car showroom, and the other a residential building.
While it is unclear who fired the rockets, Lebanon's interior minister, Marwan Charbel, said it appeared the rockets had come from the south-east of the city.
The attacks come after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah addressed his followers yesterday, committing the militant group to fighting in Syria's conflict.
Syrian rebels have threatened retaliation against the Hezbollah group for sending fighters to assist Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is fighting to end a revolt against his rule.
The revolt started more than two years ago, and has killed 80,000 people, leaving 1.5 million refugees.
Nasrallah's speech confirmed the group are directly involved in Syria's war, and pledged they would protect Lebanon's borders from the control of rebels.
He called sending troops outside Lebanon to protect the country "a completely new phase" for Hezbollah.
In the Syrian border town of Qusayr, government and Hezbollah forces continue a seven-day battle to expel Syrian rebels from the town.
Reportedly 40 or more people were killed there yesterday, including a number of Hezbollah fighters.
Nasrallah pledged Hezbollah will continue fighting until the conflict has been turned in President Assad's favour.
A wildlife official in Zimbabwe said today that the amount of animal poaching in the country has increased substantially this year, blaming an international crime syndicate.
He said that 65 elephants and 30 rhinoceroses have been killed this year by poachers.
"From January to October this year we have lost 65 elephants through poaching," said Vitalis Chadenga, the operations director of the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Authority.
"In the same period we have lost 24 black and six white rhinos. "
"It is true that we have witnessed an escalation of poaching nationwide, particularly on private farms."
"We do have a group of international gangsters, who are funding poachers around this part of the world and taking away many horns and it is a major problem," the director continued; "we have arrested 2,500 poachers in the same period, ten poachers have been shot dead since the beginning of this year."
Zimbabwe is one of four countries in Africa that are home to large numbers of rhinos, the others being Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa.
About 100,000 elephants live in Zimbabwe, and Chandenga said that the numbers have been growing in past years.
A tornado, spawned from a large storm, has hit the United States city of Atlanta, Georgia, causing extensive damage throughout the city.
The National Weather Service confirmed Saturday morning that it was a tornado that struck the city.
After reviewing the aftermath of the storm, they classified it as an EF2 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale.
Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin says she is beginning to apply for federal disaster aid.
There have been no confirmed deaths, but the mayor's spokeswoman says there may be dead victims trapped within the ruins of a collapsed loft complex.
The Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts are located in the historic Cabbagetown neighborhood, where at least 20 homes were destroyed.
It looks like a bomb went off, it looks like World War III, said Mahsud Olufani, who has an art studio in the neighbourhood.
At least 27 people suffered injuries, mostly cuts and bruises.
Grady Memorial Hospital, where many of the injured were taken, had suffered some window damage but was still operating.
Around 50 people have been taken to a local Red Cross shelter for displaced residents.
The tornado struck during the semifinal game of the SEC Basktetball Tournament between Mississippi State and Alabama.
Play was stopped with around 2 minutes to go in overtime when heavy wind could be heard outside with rippling of the roof.
Damage was done to the roof as debris fell to the floor.
"I thought it was a tornado or a terrorist attack," said Mississippi State guard Ben Hansbrough.
A tornado warning was issued for the downtown area a few minutes before the storm hit.
"Ironically, the guy behind me got a phone call saying there was a tornado warning," said Lisa Lynn, who was attending the game at the Georgia Dome.
And in two seconds, we heard the noise and things started to shake. 
The CNN Center in downtown Atlanta was severely damaged, especially in the atrium, where the ravaged ceiling allowed water to pour in.
Police closed several streets near the CNN Center because of the debris, which included power lines, billboards, and even office chairs.
The Omni Hotel, which is attached to the CNN Center, also sustained damage, with many of its windows shattered.
Visitors at the hotel were evacuated to the exhibition hall at street level.
" There was a lot of windows breaking and stuff falling," said Terrence Evans, a valet at the hotel.
At Centennial Olympic Park, located near CNN and the Omni Hotel, two Olympic torch sculptures had fallen over, and a performance pavilion was destroyed.
A high-rise dorm at Georgia State University was damaged by the tornado, as evidenced by a large hole in the building's 14th floor.
According to Georgia Power, more than 13,000 of their customers are currently without electricity.
Crews are working to fix downed power lines, but they said it would be difficult with all the debris.
Another large storm, currently in Mississippi, is heading towards Atlanta, and is forecast to arrive around 3 p.m. 
National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Leary said Friday's storm could be "nothing to compare with what's coming in tomorrow".
All downtown events scheduled to occur Saturday have been cancelled.
The remaining SEC tournament games are to be played at Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum, located in the undamaged midtown.
Four bombs blasted at popular seaside resorts in northern Spain on Sunday.
The blasts were preceded by the warning of the Basque separatist group ETA, which allowed the police to evacuate the nearby area.
Previously, a first homemade bomb blasted in a bank in the Basque town of Getxo.
Five hours later, a warning call was received in the Basque fire service telling that four bombs were planted on the beaches of Laredo and Noja, in the northern Spanish province of Cantabria.
The four bombs exploded between 1100 (1000 GMT) and 1400.
There were no injuries because the police had evacuated the area.
ETA has routinely targeted tourist destinations in northern Spain during summer months.
Celia Franca, founder of the National Ballet of Canada and its training ground, the National Ballet School of Canada, died at age 85 Monday in Ottawa, Ontario.
She is reported to have died in an Ottawa Hospital and her cause of death is not known.
She went to the hospital last week and stayed there until she had died.
"She was its presiding spirit, its most stalwart supporter and the embodiment of its ideals and values," said Karen Kain, the National Ballet of Canada's current artistic director.
"She inspired generations of dancers by her example and her devotion to the art of ballet."
"And most importantly, she made us believe in ourselves and that no goal was ever out of reach."
Franca, born 1921 in London, England, came to Canada in 1951 to found the National Ballet of Canada.
Franca choreographed ballets in Canada such as the famous "Cinderella" and "The Nutcracker."
She was artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada for 24 years.
In 1967, Franca was named an officer of the Order of Canada, then named a Companion of the order in 1985.
The Australian Democrats deputy leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett moved in the Australian Senate a bill to amend the Marriage Act to provide for same-sex marriages.
Senator Bartlett's second reading speech which was incorporated into the Hansard described that the bill "reverses the Marriage Amendment Act 2004...which...changed the definition to that of a union between one man and one woman only", and refuted arguments against same-sex marriage proposed by some conservative Government senators.
Bartlett continued to say that "We do not want to send the message that discrimination is acceptable in Australia" to our children, or to other nations."
In an interview on June 8, Prime Minister John Howard said, "I don’t see it in any way as discriminating against homosexuals."
Debate on the bill will occur at a later date.
A bill proposed later in the sitting day by the Australian Greens to stop the Governor-General disallowing ACT state law establishing civil unions failed, by a majority of two votes.
An investigation by KPMG into contracts by Liverpool City Council produced 43 recommendations, relating to council joint ventures Liverpool Direct with British Telecom and Liverpool Enterprise with Enterprise plc.
The recommendations include reducing the informal contact between Council staff and those of the contractors, limits on the time between members of staff leaving the council and joining the contractors.
According to a recent interview, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards is said to have snorted his late father's ashes mixed with cocaine.
In an interview with the NME magazine he is quoted as saying "The strangest thing I've tried to snort? My father."
He was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow.
My dad wouldn't have cared, he didn't give a shit.
Despite the interview, Richards denies he said anything like that and that he ever used cocaine.
"I wouldn't take cocaine at this point in my life unless I wished to commit suicide."
The truth of the matter is that I planted a sturdy English Oak.
Bert, who had been the father of Richards, died when he was 84, back in 2002.
Richard's manager later told the NME that the remarks had been made "in jest", and should not be taken seriously.
A cyclone struck coastal areas of Bangladesh and India, causing flooding.
At least seventeen people have been killed as a result of the storm, and thousands have been left homeless.
Winds reaching 100 kilometres per hour in Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal province, have uprooted trees and destroyed communication lines.
"The situation is very grave, countless families have been displaced, especially in the Sundarbans," said Kanti Ganguly, the state minister of the Sundarbans region of Western Bengal.
Airport operations in Kolkata were stopped as a result of the inclement weather; several Kolkata-bound flights were diverted elsewhere, and flights scheduled to depart were cancelled.
The India Meteorological Department has said that the cyclone will likely subside within 24 hours.
 “We expect the wind speed to peak in the next 24 hours."
"This isn’t an unusually strong cyclone and we don’t expect damage to be widespread,” said the department's director general, Ajith Tyagi.
Scientists at NASA say that new satellite images of Saturn's moon Enceladus taken in 2005, has shown that the moon has begun to spew geysers which contain liquid water, and that the internal heat produced by the moon's core may be able to host life below the icy surface, but scientists also stress that life has not yet been found on the moon.
Scientists say that the heat source producing the geysers is "organic" and that the material used to spew them is caused by the decaying of radioactive material from inside the moon.
"Deep inside Enceladus, our model indicates we've got an organic brew, a heat source and liquid water, all key ingredients for life."
"And while no one is claiming that we have found life by any means, we probably have evidence for a place that might be hospitable to life," said Dennis Matson, a scientist for the Cassini project.
In a new model created by NASA scientists, data shows that Enceladus might have been created by aluminum and iron isotopes which have begun to decay causing large amounts of heat to build up in the moon and over billions of years later, the icy mass has began to melt near the moon's core, causing the water to spew into outer space.
"Enceladus is a very small body, and it's made almost entirely of ice and rock."
"The puzzle is how the moon developed a warm core."
"The only way to achieve such high temperatures at Enceladus is through the very rapid decay of some radioactive species," said Dr. Julie Castillo, the lead scientist developing the new model at the Jet Propulsion laboratory or JPL.
"The decomposition of those isotopes - over a period of about 7 million years - would produce enormous amounts of heat."
"This would result in the consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice."
"According to the theory, the remaining, more slowly decaying radioactivity in the core could continue to warm and melt the moon's interior for billions of years, along with tidal forces from Saturn's gravitational tug," said a statement on NASA"s website.
Data from Cassini's ion and neutral mass spectrometer further shows that the natural building blocks of life are also present within Enceladus.
The results show that carbon dioxide, acetylene, methane, propane and nitrogen, the basic building blocks for life, are all present within the moon.
"The team concludes that so far, all the findings and the hot start model indicate that a warm, organic-rich mixture was produced below the surface of Enceladus and might still be present today, making the moon a promising kitchen for the cooking of primordial soup," added the statement.
Cassini will make a flyby on Enceladus in march of 2008.
The mission will "measure the gas emanating from the plume," ended the statement.
Thousands of protestors demonstrated today in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
They left their houses due to unrest over the results of the November 6 parliamentary elections, which, according to the opposition, are faked.
The protest lasted about three hours before being shut down.
The protest gathered some 15,000 people, but the opposition hoped to gather 30,000 to 50,000 Azeris.
Many people were stopped by police on their way to the outskirts of Baku.
When rioters tried to enlarge the protest, police used force to stop them.
Some Azeris believe that a "three hour revolution" wouldn't change anything in the country.
They believe that the demonstration was controlled by the government.
The November 6 elections, won, according to officials, by the governing New Azerbaijan Party, have been condemned by international organizations, such as The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and by independent observers.
The Council of Europe reports that results in about 43% of polling stations were faked.
To prevent protests, re-runs were ordered in two districts by election officials.
Scientists have uncovered the largest Neolithic settlement in the United Kingdom at the Durrington Walls and believe that the village was inhabited by the people who built the Stonehenge monument.
Scientists say that the village was built around 2,600 B.C., roughly when Stonehenge was believed to have been constructed, and housed over 100 people.
Inside the areas which would have been the interior of houses at the time, scientists also found outlines of what they think were beds and cupboards or dressers.
Animal bones, arrowheads, stone tools and other relics were also discovered.
"We've never seen such quantities of pottery and animal bone and flint.
In what were houses, we have excavated the outlines on the floors of box beds and wooden dressers or cupboards," said Sheffield University archaeologist, Mike Parker Pearson.
So far, the dig has revealed at least 8 houses roughly 14-16 feet square, but scientists say that they think there may have been at least 25 altogether.
The site was likely to have been occupied only seasonally rather than year-round and evidence suggests that a lot of "partying" went on at the location.
This is where they went to party - you could say it was the first free festival.
There's a lack of craft-working equipment for cleaning animal hides and no evidence for crop-processing," added Pearson.
The Durrington Walls are approximately 2 miles from the Stonehenge site.
In a speech in Wisconsin, US President Barack Obama announced a USD50 billion plan to restore 150,000 miles of roads, lay 4,000 miles of railroad tracks and rebuild 150 miles of airport runways within six years.
The speech was given at an annual Labor Day festival in Milwaukee to union workers on Monday afternoon.
"All of this will not only create jobs immediately, it's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul," Obama said during the speech.
The president also said that "we are going to rebuild 150,000 miles of our roads — that's enough to circle the world six times...
We're going to lay and maintain 4,000 miles of our railways — enough to stretch coast-to-coast" and that he was "going to keep fighting, every single day, every single hour, every single minute to turn this economy around".
Most of the new railways that Obama talked about will be high-speed rail lines, and the president also said that his administration would "restore 150 miles of runways and advance a next-generation air traffic control system to reduce travel time and delays for American travelers — something I think folks across the political spectrum could agree on."
In the Obama Administration's plan, a new infrastructure bank will be created.
Obama stressed that the new bill will not add to the federal budget deficit, with Obama saying that "this is a plan that will be fully paid for.
It will not add to the deficit over time — we're going to work with Congress to see to that."
An Obama administration official also said that the plan will be funded by closing tax loopholes for oil and gas corporations.
Though Obama said that "these are projects and efforts that have bipartisan support that we know could possibly get support in the Congress and the Senate", Republicans expressed reservations about the new plan, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell calling it "a last-minute, cobbled-together stimulus bill".
Announced early Wednesday morning at Nokia's GoEvent, in a plan to expand the company's revenue, Finland-based company Nokia Inc. is developing a mobile phone similar to its rival iPhone, which will be available in the near future for Nokia customers.
Most of the features are the same as the iPhone's.
They include music, games, and many other features, even ones that the iPhone may not have.
Ovi (in Finnish meaning "Door") will be the door for more than 2 million songs and games available for download on the new device.
Users will be able to download wirelessly in their own home or anywhere there is access to a computer.
But this is not the first time Nokia has made an attempt like this to increase its revenue.
In October of 2003 the company revealed the N-Gage, a game-playing cell phone, but was "stocked-out" due to poor sales.
The N95 smartphone, which was released in the U.S. on April 7, 2007 (before the iPhone on June 29, 2007) includes WiFi, a GPS, a music player, and a 5 megapixel digital camera.
The three other phones that were revealed at the event in London will be in-stock next quarter.
The new N81 and the modified N95 smartphones were among the revealed at yesterday's event; the N81 is a new member to Nokia's smartphone family; the N95 has been modified by having more memory and a sleeker LCD screen.
When Nokia was asked about the striking similarity between this and the iPhone, Nokia's Executive Vice President and General Manager of Multimedia, Anssi Vanjoki, said, "If there is something good in the world then we copy with pride."
During their demo they omitted the fact that the demo was for the software to be in use, not the actual hardware.
When Wouter Van Bellingen became the first black registrar in Belgium, he knew there would be negative reactions, but he admitted that he didn't expect them to be "so direct, so soon."
In February, three couples refused to pledge their wedding vows in front of the first black alderman of the city of Sint-Niklaas, because of the colour of his skin.
After the racist incident, Van Bellingen told himself: "If people don't want to marry, then that's not my problem, it's the problem of those people."
But then someone gave him the idea to react with a positive signal against racial discrimination.
Together with local NGOs and the Center for Equal Opportunities and against Racial Discrimination, he decided to organise a multicultural group marriage happening to, as mayor of Sint-Niklaas Freddy Willockx describes it, "forge this stupid racist behaviour into an unparallelled positive signal against racism and for tolerance."
Police in Kenya have arrested a man thought to be the organiser of an attack by up to 30 men armed with clubs and spears that killed internationally renowned Scottish gemstone expert Campbell Bridges.
The 71-year-old was ambushed last week near Voi where he owns several mines.
Bridges' family had received death threats for years over a dispute over access to his gemstone mines.
Regional police chief Herbert Khaemba anounced today: "The suspect believed to be the main organiser of the brutal murder was arrested by the police at the Kenyan border town of Taveta in hiding.
The police are still pursuing other suspects who were armed with crude weapons during the attack."
The arrested man is reported to be the chairman of a group of local small-scale miners.
He is thought to have been intending to flee to neighbouring Tanzania.
The area's minerals have been disputed ever since Bridges discovered the locally unique stone Tsavorite in the 1960s.
Major distributors of the operating system Linux have agreed on a new standard that includes common elements for desktop software, in a move to make Linux a more effective competitor to Microsoft Windows.
The Free Standards Group (FSG) will unveil the Linux Standard Base (LSB) 3.1 on Tuesday at the Desktop Linux Summit in San Diego.
The first distribution to include LSB 3.1 support, Xandros, is expected to be released on May 1, followed shortly by versions by Red Hat, Novell, and others.
The status of Ubuntu's upcoming version is still unclear .
The standards aim to resolve difficulties that programmers face in developing software for Linux.
Because Linux, developed by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, defines the kernel or core of the operating system, there is a wide variety of graphical interfaces for it and differing software libraries.
LSB 3.1 standardizes core pieces of Linux to make development easier.
"One of the big things that's difficult is consistency, and that's Windows' biggest strength," Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Free Standards Group, told the Associated Press.
"If you buy a Windows program, you know it will run on a Windows computer, and Linux needs to work the same way.
If you really want to become a broadly adopted and used technology, you have to have that degree of standardization," he said.
Children who spend more time playing with other children are less likely to end up getting childhood cancers, a UK study published today in the British Medical Journal has found.
The finding supports the researchers' theory that reduced exposure to common infections in the first year of life increases the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
A total of nearly 10,000 children took part in the study, located in 10 regions across the UK.
Amount of time spent in daycare and social activity, during the first year of life, were used to gauge the level of exposure of the infants to common infections such as cold and flu.
Day care in the first year of life for at least two days a week, with at least three other kids, halved a child's chance of contracting ALL.
Those who were rated in the category "any social activity" still had an improvement over the children rated as "no social activity": they had about 3/4 the chance of getting the disease.
The study describes that effect was "more striking" for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia — a cancer affecting blood and the immune system — than it was for the set of all other cancers.
Increasing levels of activity saw decreasing chances of childhood cancers, when compared against children who during their first year had no regular social activity outside the home.
Theories have been around since the 1940s that childhood exposure to infection was related to the development of childhood leukaemia — one, like the working theory of the UK study, said that lack of immune challenge was a factor, another that leukaemia developed as a delayed result of some type of infection.
The research was conducted by the Institute of Cancer Research in London and in Sutton, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of York, Christie Hospital and Central Manchester and Manchester Children's University Hospitals NHS Trusts, and the University of Edinburgh.
An explosion yesterday in a Russian nightclub killed at least 94 people and injured a further 139, according to police reports.
The incident happened in the "Lame Horse" bar in the city of Perm near the Ural mountains.
According to the regional security minister, Igor Orlov, the club's plastic ceiling caught fire, ignited by firecrackers.
Security officials, however, commented that the blast could not have been terrorism.
"We are not talking about a terrorist attack, we are talking about a failure to observe fire regulations," said an official for an investigative body, as quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency.
A reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency remarked: "Officials have been cited as saying that the incident may have been caused by pyrotechnics that caused an explosion leading to a significant loss of life."
The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, has become the first Arab leader to visit the Gaza Strip since its occupation by Israel in 1967.
He entered the strip by car from Egypt, to an enthusiastic welcome by Gazans.
Much of the strip's infrastructure was destroyed by Israeli bombing in 2008.
The Emir of Qatar called for unity of the various Palestinian groups.
Speaking at Gaza's Islamic University, he asked, "Why are you staying divided?"
"There are no peace negotiations, and there is no clear strategy of resistance and liberation."
Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya said the visit demonstrated Gaza is "not alone" and broke Israel's blockade of Gaza.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas contacted the emir directly to point out the international community recognizes Mr Abbas as the Palestinian leader.
Spokesman Yigal Palmor for Israel's Foreign Ministry said, "This is more than strange, especially since Hamas is internationally recognized as a terror group."
"By hugging Hamas publicly, the emir of Qatar has thrown peace under the bus."
The emir founded the Al Jazeera international television news network.
The country also maintains contacts in Islamic politics and scholarship.
Qatar has the highest GDP per capita in the world at $88,000.
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has accused Japan of creating a rift between Pacific Countries.
She accuses Japan of influencing the voting of some member nations of the Pacific Island Forum at the International Whaling Commission by supplying vast amounts of aid to certain small pacific nations.
New Zealand provides a total of $23 million a year in aid to three of the six Pacific nations – Kiribati, the Solomons, and Tuvalu.
Japan pledged approximately 45 billion yen (NZ $633 million) in aid for all Pacific nations.
New Zealand's annual budget for aiding pacific nations on the other hand totals merely NZ $173 million.
Miss Clark is quoted as saying "One would hope that over time Japan might reflect on the damage this is doing to [its] relationships around the world" and that it "sprayed a lot of money around" to garner support.
The Prime Minister has ruled out any retaliation against the islands, saying it would not affect any future aid funding.
Che Guevara's "Motorcycle Diaries" companion dies
 Both were intellectually curious and interested in exploration.
In 1951 they set out on an eight-month motorcycle trip through South American that exposed them to the poverty in which most South Americans lived.
The pair worked in a leprosy colony and met wtih destitute miners and indigenous people.
Both men kept diaries which served as the basis for the 2004 film, The Motorcycle Diaries, produced by Robert Redford and directed by Walter Salles.
According to the Guardian, "Their road trip awoke in Guevara a social consciousness and political convictions that would turn him into one of the iconic revolutionaries of the 20th century."
The trip is widely believed to have inspired Guevara to go to Cuba and join Fidel Castro in his 1959 revolt against Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.
By the time the two men met again eight years later, Guevara was a revolutionary hero and chief of Cuba’s central bank.
Jiménez, who had remained in Argentina working in a clinic, accepted Guevara's invitation to move to Cuba in 1961 and founded a medical facility in Santiago.
Later he moved to Havana where he continued his medical work.
The two remained friends although they did not always agree.
Jiménez rejected Guevara’s belief that social reform in Latin America had to be accomplished through guerrilla warfare.
The book The Motorcycle Diaries was published in the 1990's.
At least 30 explosions have gone off inside the "Green Zone" in Baghdad, Iraq where the United States Embassy is located and where many Iraqi Government buildings are housed.
Iraqi military officials said no evacuations of residents were ordered from the Dora area.
The explosions are believed to be the result of a fire which broke out inside the Forward Operating Base Falcon, a U.S. ammunitions depot inside the zone, but it is not known if the fire was started due to an attack.
It's in our operating base in the Rasheed area of the city.
"The ammunition holding area contains tank and artillery rounds as well as small arms ammunition," said Lieutenant Colonel of the 4th Infantry Division, Jonathan Withington.
"[We are] trying to determine the cause or any threat to the population," said U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col, Christopher C. Garver.
Reports say that flares and helicopters could be seen coming from and into the zone.
So far, there are no reports of any deaths or injuries.
Consumer confidence rose in December to levels closer to those before hurricane Katrina according to the Conference Board Consumer Research Center's consumer confidence index.
The index was at 105.5 before the huricane hit the port of New Orleans disrupting oil production and trade for a large part of the country.
The index rose to 103.6 from a revised 98.3 for November.
"Consumer confidence continues to bounce back and is now at its highest level since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center.
Most of the change is attributed to falling gas prices and an improved job outlook.
"The resiliency of the economy, recent declines in prices at the pump, and job growth have consumers feeling more confident at year-end than they felt at the start of 2005," Franco said.
"Even though all of the improvement over the past twelve months has been in consumers' assessment of current conditions, and expectations remain below earlier levels, consumers are confident that the economy will continue to expand in 2006."
Former US president Bill Clinton was the guest of honor in a memorial ceremony attended by some 200,000 Israelis in Tel Aviv to mark the 10th anniversary of the assassination of Israeli Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
The rally was delayed one week due to Clinton's schedule.
Clinton opened his speech with some words of respect to the deputy prime minister Shimon Peres, "My dear friend Shimon Peres, thank you for servicing the case of peace all of your life and being a partner and a leader to all of us".
Regarding Rabin, Clinton said, "I loved him very much, and I was in awe of his ability to move from being a soldier to being a peacemaker, a politician to a statesman".
Clinton said that it was a great honor for him to be at the ceremony with his wife, daughter and friends from America to stand in solidarity for the memory of Yitzhak Rabin.
He said: "If he were here he would say, There is enough of all this missing."
"If you really think I lived a good life, if you think I made a noble sacrifice in death, then for goodness sakes, take up my work and see it through to the end" and concluded his speech with the words in Hebrew — "Shalom Haver" (Goodbye my friend).
Later Clinton joined Peres and the rest of the politicians, most of whom were from Rabin's Cabinet and were with him on the same stage in the original peace rally for singing "The Song For Peace", the same song that they sang with Rabin that night.
A raid involving 50 members of the Swedish National Criminal Police has taken the servers of The Pirate Bay and Piratbyrån (the Pirate Bureau) — a Swedish lobby organisation that originally developed The Pirate Bay — into custody.
The search warrant was given on grounds of alleged copyright violation and assisting copyright violation.
This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as the legality of the site has been under public debate for over three years, with the operators frequently issuing public press releases.
WiredFire, in an interview with Rickard Falkvinge, head of the Swedish Pirate Party, is reporting that police arrested three staff members, ultimately taking only two into custody.
The Associated Press, however, is reporting that Ulf Goranzon, a police spokesman, is claiming that none were arrested, they were just under suspicion of violating copyright law.
The site operators speculate that the police wish to test the legality of the operation.
Purportedly, this move comes due to political pressure exerted by United States media corporations.
However, The Pirate Bay claimed that as they only host .torrent files and not copyrighted material, they are not in contravention of copyright laws.
The Pirate Bay also served as a distribution point for freely licensed material such as some Linux distributions and independent music and film.
The Pirate Bay claims to be the world's largest BitTorrent tracker.
In the raid, the police also took several private servers unconnected to The Pirate Bay.
Some have claimed that there is no legal basis for these seizures.
Initially, there were also rumors that this could be another stunt by The Pirate Bay to promote awareness.
This possibility, however, has been already dismissed and only had some credibility given the fact that approximately one year ago today they claimed something similar like this, but instead were simply updating their servers.
At current there are already some publications made available by officials confirming the authenticity of the raid.
On June the 1st The Pirate Bay site changed its "Site down" note to "Site down - will be up and fully functional within a day or two".
The day after the raid, Mr. Svartholm is trying to limit the damage for PRQ's other customers that also had their servers confiscated, even if they didn't have any connections to The Pirate Bay.
A classified European Union report for 2009 says Israel is actively pursuing the annexation of east Jerusalem.
The report accuses Israel of implementing an intricate policy including expanding Jewish settlements and demolishing Palestinian homes.
It says policies "are undermining prospects for a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem and incrementally render a sustainable two-state solution unfeasible"; this is described as, "an integral part of a broader Israeli strategy."
Israeli Foreign ministry spokesperson, Yigal Palmor, told AFP that the report was "dishonest", "reflects the Palestinian propaganda" and "is based exclusively on Palestinian versions and figures."
This comes as EU foreign ministers prepare a statement on the Middle East.
To allow for US initiatives, EU foreign ministers have not commented on the stalemate between Israel and the Palestinians over past months; but, diplomatic sources say there are “sensitivities" over a Swedish proposal to divide Jerusalem in any peace deal.
Citing official Israeli statistics from the Ministry of Interior executive director of Israel’s HaMoked (Center for the Defence of the Individual) said Wednesday that, "Israel has stripped Palestinians of Jerusalem residency status last year at a faster rate than at any time in the history of the state".
4,577 residents of East Jerusalem have had their residence revoked in 2008, this is more than half the total revoked in the past 40 years.
The Jerusalem municipality places severe restrictions on issuing building permits for Palestinian houses in east Jerusalem, since 2000 over 600 Palestinian-owned structures have been demolished and Palestinians receive fewer than 200 of the 1,500 building permits needed per year.
The 14-page annual report dated November 23 was drafted by European envoys and consuls in Jerusalem and Ramallah and presented to Brussels EU institutions a few days ago.
This is the first time the annual report has been made public.
Haaretz says, in the past, Israel has pressed the EU not to publish fearing it would undermine the European public's view of Israel.
The report was leaked to Israel's Haaretz daily newspaper and obtained by AFP yesterday.
The EU report claims the Israeli government and Jerusalem municipality discriminate against Arab residents with regard to building permits, health services, education, sanitation and more.
Allegations of assisting private right-wing Jewish organisations, such as Ateret Cohanim and Elad, to alter the city's demographics are included.
The report advises sanctions against people and groups involved in "settlement activity", and taking other measures to protest Israeli policy and to stop the harming of the Arab population, including an "EU presence at Israeli court cases on house demolitions or evictions of Palestinian families when there is a risk of demolition or eviction of Palestinian families", and "information sharing on violent settlers in East Jerusalem to assess whether to grant entry to the EU."
The report also recommends implementing measures to strengthen the Palestinian National Authority's presence in the city.
Archaeological excavations in Jerusalem near the Temple Mount are mentioned, suggesting "archaeology in this case has become an ideologically motivated tool of national and religious struggle carried out in a manner that modifies the identity and character of the city and threatens to undermine its stability."
Police in Russia say they have identified the man behind the bombing of Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport on Monday, although they will not yet name him.
Police said the man who killed 35 was a twenty-year-old suicide bomber from the North Caucasus region.
An Investigative Committee statement delivered by spokesman Vladimir Markin said "We have established the identity of the terrorist suicide bomber who set off the explosive."
"He turned out to be a 20-year-old native from one of the North Caucasus republics," and "Despite the investigation having established the name of the terrorist, we will not name him today," because it may hamper ongoing efforts to detain people suspected of collaborating.
Markin added "I would especially like to note that it was by no means an accident that the act of terror was committed in the international arrivals hall…"
"According to investigators, the act of terror was first and foremost aimed against foreign citizens."
Eight of those killed were foreigners and several flights had just landed from European origins.
President Dmitry Medvedev sacked several transportations officials in the wake of the bombing.
The nation's transport infrastructure will deal with extra visitors when the country hosts the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2018 World Cup.
Medvedev has targeted both security officials and airport management in the wake of the bombing.
Few official details have been released by the investigation and unofficial reports in the press have been contradictory; one report suggested a suicide bomber wearing a plastic explosive-based shrapnel bomb belt.
Another said it could have been detonated remotely, while a third suggested a timer.
Russian newspapers initially suggested a bag had exploded on the floor, while local TV has shown CCTV footage of the explosion.
Unconfirmed reports also claim the Federal Security Service was searching for three people ahead of the attack and that the bomber was Vitaly Razdobudko of Stavropol.
Although nobody has claimed responsibility or been arrested for the airport attack, Markin told reporters several people have been brought in on suspicion of planning an attack on December 31, while others are being sought.
He linked them to an explosion on the 31st in a Moscow hotel, in which a bomber died after the device he was building went off prematurely.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that the attack is not thought to be linked to Chechnyan insurgency.
The attack is Moscow's second within a year, with two women from Dagestan, North Caucuses blowing themselves up on the Metro and killing 39 in 2010.
The John Lewis Partnership retail group announced massively increased profits this morning, with group sales up 11% on the financial year to £6.4billion ($12.3billion) and pre-tax profits up 27% to £319million ($614.8 million).
On the back of this, it was announced that the amount of money set aside from profits for the employees of the business would rise 29% to £155million, with each employee receiving 18% of their previous year's salary as a lump sum as part of their March pay package.
The Partnership, as the name implies, is effectively wholly owned by its own employees (termed "partners"), with all partners receiving a share of the profits yearly as a bonus along with various other benefits.
The company owns the John Lewis chain of department stores and the upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose.
It should not be confused with the Liverpool store Lewis's which has recently gone into receivership.
Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen signed a bill Wednesday authorizing the state's new budget of nearly $26 billion.
The new budget increases spending for education and fulfills Bredesen's commitment to decrease TennCare spending.
The new budget also includes an increase in spending for the state's preschool program, as much as $100 million in funding for TennCare disenrollees, and a significant contribution to the state's reserve fund.
Bredesen also signed into law a bill authorizing the General Assembly to begin drafting new ethics laws.
A judge in Germany has ordered a man from Kosovo to be jailed for life for carrying out the "first Islamic-motivated terror attack" within the country.
Arid Uka, 22, killed two US (USAF) men and wounded two more in a gun attack on their bus in Frankfurt.
Uka, a Kosovan who has lived in Germany since he was four, worked in Frankfurt Airport's mail room.
He became attracted to Islamic radicalism in a matter of months and would later cite a video appearing to show US soldiers raping women in Afghanistan as his motive for the attack.
Uka approached a USAF bus at the airport, asking a serviceman for a cigarette.
Upon learning the group was bound for Afghanistan he fatally shot the man in the head before boarding the bus with a cry of (God is Great).
There, he opened fire upon more USAF airmen, killing a second and injuring two others.
The remaining eleven passengers escaped injury when his 9mm pistol jammed.
The team had been loading their bus in front of the airport during a trip that began in the United Kingdom.
The fatalities were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21.
Edgar Veguilla received arm and jaw wounds while Kristoffer Schneider was left requiring reconstructive surgery for his face.
Uka's weapon failed whilst pointed at a fifth man's head.
Schneider has ongoing pain, blindness in one eye, a missing section of skull and a face rebuilt from titanium.
Schneider testified via videolink from a USAF base in his homeland.
Prosecution evidence included songs and text from Uka's computer, phone, and music player.
He was said to have radicalised alone through access to material such as the fake rape film, which was actually a scene from the anti-war movie .
In sentencing Uka for murder Judge Thomas Sagebiel agreed with prosecutors there were aggravating circumstances that amounted to "particularly severe guilt," a move likely to prevent parole after fifteen years as is normally possible with German life sentences.
The judge said the attack was aggravated by its ambush nature, that unarmed men were attacked and Alden was also attacked from behind, and that the wounds inflicted were serious.
Sagebiel also noted Uka's refusal to explain how he acquired the gun.
There was no drug or alcohol use involved, and no evidence Uka had been trained for the attack.
The killer described himself to the court as spending much of his time on computers, with few friends and a largely non-religious family background.
He sat motionless with his eyes down and arms folded during the 70-minute verdict and sentencing hearing.
Uka had not joined any radical organisations and the defence claimed he was not a terrorist.
Last year he blamed inaccurate propaganda for having influenced him and apologised, claiming not to understand his own actions.
His defence lawyer, Michaela Roth, also sought to have his youth, admissions, and a troubled childhood considered.
Roth had suggested sexual abuse when Uka was six had led to a return of trauma when he saw the falsified rape video.
This was undermined by psychiatric expert opinion, a report finding the abuse — and the video — of no "decisive relevance".
He was aware when he killed, and did not have a personality disorder although he was of "an immature personality," it concluded.
"The attack was not only cowardly and perfidious, but also damaged Germany's reputation," said Sagebiel, telling victims and their relatives he "hoped that by our bringing the perpetrator to justice swiftly, you can find some comfort... and will not harbour any rancour towards Germany."
Alden's brother Joe was in court and later said "justice has been served."
An American football coach has been shot at his school gym in Iowa, United States.
Ed Thomas was shot in front of his students at around 8.00 am local time.
Thomas was in the weight room at the time of the shooting.
An adult male has been arrested suspected of his murder.
Thomas was the head football coach at Aplington-Parkersburg High School.
He had coached 37 seasons of High School football in his career and has a career record of 292-84 of which 156-31 is with Aplington-Parkersburg.
He led Parkersburg to 19 state playoffs and won state titles in 1993 and 2001.
He was named NFL High School Coach of the Year in 2003 and previously coached four active NFL players including Brad Meester, Jared DeVries, Casey Wiegmann and Aaron Kampman.
Thomas was well known in the local community for his work.
When Parkersburg was hit by a tornado in the summer of 2008 Thomas worked endlessly to restore the damaged football field.
County Sheriff Jason Johnson said that "Coach Thomas is the pillar of the community.
Chris Hughton has been appointed permanent manager of English football club Newcastle United, having previously served as its temporary caretaker manager since the start of the season.
His permanent contract was to run until the end of the 2010–11 season.
The 50 year old former Tottenham Hotspur and Republic of Ireland defender joined the club in 2008 when he was appointed Newcastle United assistant manager by Kevin Keegan, with the club at the time in the top flight of English football, the Premier League.
Hughton then became temporary Newcastle United caretaker manager twice last season, as managers came and went, and at the end of the season, the club were ultimately relegated to the second tier, the Football League Championship.
In his third spell as caretaker, he had been in charge of the club since the start of the season, and had guided the team to the top of the table, and for his efforts was awarded the Football League Championship Manager of the Month twice, for August and September.
"It's a very proud day for me to be named as the manager of this magnificent football club.
I will be doing everything in my power to get the club back into the Premier League at the first time of asking.
Having the unequivocal backing of the players has helped me enormously and I would also like to thank Colin Calderwood, Paul Barron and the rest of the backroom staff who have been tremendously supportive to me this season."
According to Sky Sports, many Newcastle fans had 'made no secret of their desire' to see a return to the club as manager of Alan Shearer after relegation and over the summer break.
Shearer, the former club captain, was hired on a short term 8 game contract at the end of last season, but could not steer the club away from relegation.
As the new season progressed, Hughton remained caretaker, and ten days prior to Hughton's appointment, Shearer had said:
"I can't revolve my life around that any more because I have other things going on.
If it happens, it happens, and if it doesn't, it doesn't...And at the moment Chris Hughton is doing a great job."
The announcement came on the same day as it announced that the club would be putting the naming rights of the club stadium St James' Park up for offers next season, and that owner Mike Ashley was taking the club off the market for a second time.
The opening ceremonies for the 2007 Baseball World Cup (2007 BWC) were held Tuesday.
Torrential rain, however, made Panama vs Spain the opening match of the 2007 BWC in Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium.
The original opening match of Chinese Taipei vs Italy was postponed until next week and will be played at Tianmu Baseball Stadium.
"Recently, we got into a sticky situation while constructing a dome due to some protests by non-governmental people, but we'll try to overcome these difficulties in order to present high-level sports to the international market."
Chin-chi Wu, the Director of the Taipei City Bureau of Education, remarked at Tuesday's opening ceremony.
Aid from the United Nations has started to reach Myanmar after a recent cyclone in the region killed tens of thousands.
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon released a statement regarding the delivery of aid to Myanmar:
Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.
Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred.
At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of the country.
The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.
Popular social networking website Facebook went down for unknown upgrades, possibly to circumvent multiple holes that were published in a white paper earlier.
From roughly 1:00 to 4:15 pm ET, users reported the site was down.
Blogs have speculated it may be simply a server upgrade, or it may be new features.
One web development blogger has even raised the theory that the site was hacked, with the login box showing multiple random email addresses, through "<input>" coding.
Another user replied to this posting, saying that they were even able to read the other, random user's inbox.
Both a blogger who works at a computing company's office in Johannesburg, South Africa and a Norwegian news outlet reported similar troubles.
Many blogs received comments from people with similar circumstances, worldwide.
A white paper by Adrienne Felt, posted on July 27, 2007, explained step-by-step how to use an exploit to hijack a user's account.
The white paper was then partially censored by the author, until the vulnerability has been fixed by Facebook.
Regardless of whether the change was prompted by this paper, both the XSS hole and problem with forms described by the author were fixed during the upgrade.
This is the first known global outage for the site.
This comes as a rival site, ConnectU, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea and the code.
Also on Wednesday, the Black Hat Briefings computer security conference begins.
The conference unites people from "government agencies and global corporations with the underground's most respected hackers."

United States Food and Drug Administration announced that cloned meat and milk from specific animals was "...as safe as the food we eat every day."
An FDA spokesperson also added that there where "No unique risks for human food consumption...".
Coming after a lengthy study, the move is likely to meet with opposition from U.S. consumers, despite the final decision having still to be made.
Carol Foreman, a spokesperson for the Consumer Federation, was quoted as calling the move "a very bad decision".
A motorist was injured during a collision that resulted in a rollover in the city of Naperville, Illinois, United States.
The accident occurred at about 8:15 am (13:15 UTC) on the interchange of Illinois Route 59 and Interstate 88.
Naperville police reported that Pavitra Durgam, a 26-year-old from Chicago, was traveling southbound on Route 59 and tried to turn left onto the ramp to Interstate 88.
In doing so, she cut in front of a car heading north on Route 59.
The other, currently unidentified driver swerved to avoid her, hit a curb, and collided with her car anyway. 
Northbound traffic on Route 59 north of Diehl Road, including the entrance into eastbound Interstate 88, was blocked as crews cleaned up the area of the collision.
The unidentified motorist complained of back pain and was thus sent to nearby Edward Hospital.
Durgam received a citation for failing to yield to oncoming traffic as she turned. 
The Coast Guard reported yesterday that a cargo ship laden with cement sank overnight in the Philippines, killing the vessel's chief engineer.
A passing ship rescued the 19 others, while a coast guard rescue boat itself required rescue in strong waves in the region after getting into difficulties before losing contact.
MV Maria Lourdes, a 639-ton vessel, had been transporting 22,000 bags of cement from Iligan City in Lanao del Norte and was headed towards a town in Occidental Mindoro when the starboard main engine failed.
While running on only the port main engine, strong waves battered the ship until shortly after 7:00 p.m. Tuesday night, when she went down at Antique.
The Coast Guard received word on the emergency at 7:03 p.m. from Candano Shipping Lines.
Vessel 3504 was dispatched to aid the stricken ship, but the boat was also troubled by strong waves and eventually contact was lost.
A passing ship rescued the survivors from the Maria Lourdes instead.
Vessel 3504's crew were located on Sibay Island by the Philippine Air Force.
The seven-man crew had abandoned the boat to rough seas and sought refuge on the island.
A bus crash in France's Loire Valley has left seven of the Moroccan passengers dead.
22 of the 32 on board were injured, four critically, after the bus smashed into a concrete pillar on the A10 near Blois in the small hours of yesterday morning.
The bus had departed Tiznit in South Morocco on Wednesday and was headed to the Parisian suburb of Les Mureaux.
It had been hired by Aziz, a French company that provides buses to tourists and small traders heading between France and Morocco.
Media images show the vehicle's front end stuck several feet up the pillar, with the roof trapped against the top of the bridge it supported by the pillar.
The entire wreck is left leaning at about a forty degree angle back towards the road, and has left the road at a fairly steep angle directly into the pillar.
The remains of a trailer it was towing can be seen still attached at the rear of the coach.
Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau, who visited the scene shortly after the accident, said that "The incredible state of the bus showed that the impact was extremely violent."
The pictures showed the bus was in the livery of travel company Labat.
The French Interior Ministry took the rare step of activating an emergency plan to ensure rapid response from large numbers of rescuers and resources.
The scene was attended by four helicopters, 140 firefighters and 25 police officers, who had to free multiple victims from the wreck.
Six died immediately, and the seventh victim died shortly afterwards.
All the deceased were adults, and included one of the two drivers, the other of whom was seriously injured.
Investigators believe no other vehicles were involved, but the exact circumstances remain unclear.
"Is this linked to a mechanical problem, drowsiness or a totally different cause?" Bussereau said at the scene.
His ministry's accident investigation bureau will conduct a major investigation inquiry, and a separate investigation will be launched by local prosecuters.
One possible cause is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel.
Investigators are also examining the bus to try to determine any sign of mechanical trouble.
There was good weather in the region of the town of Suevres, where the accident occurred, and very little traffic was using the road at the time, thought to be around 2.50am (0050 GMT).
Morocco's King Mohammed VI has announced he will personally pay for care of the injured and repatriation of those killed.
He also asked the ambassador to France to pass on his condolences.
Nine months after announcing the interoperability between their instant messaging (IM) services, Internet rivals Microsoft and Yahoo! began limited public beta (pre-release) testing of the program.
This enables users of the two services to communicate with each other using their existing IM client, Microsoft's Windows Live Messenger (formerly MSN Messenger) and Yahoo! Messenger with Voice.
Users wishing to use the new feature can go to a special page on the service's website, where they have to review and accept an agreement.
After signing out and signing in again, the interoperability is enabled without downloading any new software.
The service is designed to allow users to see each others' online presence, view personal status messages, share select emoticons, view offline messages and add new contacts from either service.
However, more advanced features, like voice calls and shared folders are not interoperable between the two services.
The program is available internationally in more than 15 markets.
Four bombings in two days have left over 130 dead in Iraq, with at least as many injured.
Al Jazeera reports that at least 60 were killed in the two explosions at a tomb in Baghdad today.
Unlike yesterday's attacks, one of which was also in Baghdad, today's attacks happened in rapid succession.
Two gates of the Shia tomb were targeted shortly before the Friday prayer - a time at which it would be crowded.
According to police reports yesterday, at least 76 people were killed in the two separate suicide bombings that happened Thursday.
48 people were killed by a suicide bomber in a restaurant in the northeastern Iraqi town of Baquba.
The other blast had occurred in Baghdad, when a suicide bomber detonated a belt full of explosives near a group of police officers giving supplies to Iraqis displaced by sectarian violence.
"Obviously that has the fingerprints of al-Qaeda," said a Baghdad security spokesman, Major-General Qassim Moussawi, commenting yesterdays attack.
Insurgents in eastern Afghanistan fired rockets into a marketplace on Monday, killing ten civilians in an area where French armed forces were meeting with tribal elders.
French and Afghan officials said the attack, which was in the town of Tagab in the Kapisa province, wounded at least 28 people.
Two rockets hit the market as the commander of French troops in eastern Afghanistan, General Marcel Druart, was meeting tribal chiefs nearby.
"The Taliban fired the rockets from Badrab, where they have a base."
"They are strong there," said deputy police chief Haji Mohammed Akbar.
French and US medical teams evacuated the wounded by helicopter to hospitals for treatment.
The French commander attended the gathering of tribal elders, known as a "shura," as part of NATO efforts to win the trust of Afghan civilians in a region with a strong Taliban presence.
French troops have been fighting the Taliban northeast of the capital, Kabul, to try to secure towns and roads threatened by the militants.
Ric Flair (real name Richard Fliehr) has a warrant out for his arrest.
According to an ABC affiliate in Charlotte, North Carolina, Flair took part in an alleged road rage incident last Wednesday on Interstate 485.
Allegedly Flair got out of his car and assaulted the man in front of him.
One warrant for assault on someone's property and a second for assault on another person.
The U.S. Senate has adopted an amendment, proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), to a defense bill limiting detainees' court privileges.
The amendment would make the Combat Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) statutory law, the Annual Review Board (ARB) statutory law, require the designated civilian officer to be a government official who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, not allow the preponderance of evidence against a detainee be derived from undue coercion, and remove Guantanamo prisoners' right to file habeas corpus petitions in federal courts.
In regards to the habeas corpus provision, the amendment specifically states, "No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien outside the United States (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(38) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38)) who is detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."
Five Democrats jumped party lines to vote for and four Republicans jumped party lines to vote against the amendment.
Nine Senators, seven Republicans and two Democrats, did not vote on the amendment.
Kent Conrad, Mary Landrieu, Joseph Lieberman, Ben Nelson, and Ron Wyden were the Democrats who voted for the amendment.
Arlen Specter, Lincoln Chafee, Gordon Smith, and John Sununu were the Republicans who voted against the measure.
Senator Graham is quoted as saying, "The president has established procedures to determine who is an enemy combatant and to annually review their status."
"It’s now time for Congress to sign-off on these procedures and turn them into a statute, a move the courts will give great deference to."
It should be noted that under Graham's amendment, detainees would be able to challenge only the narrow question of whether the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense at the time the military determined their status as an enemy combatant were followed.
The Court of Appeals for the DC circuit would still retain the ability to rule on that question.
Civil liberties groups as well as human rights groups issued statements opposing the amendment.
"The Graham amendment will create a thousand points of darkness across the globe where the United States will be free to hold people indefinitely without a hearing and beyond the reach of U.S. law and the checks and balances of the courts enshrined in our Constitution," the Center for Constitutional Rights said in a statement.
"The Graham amendment would strip all courts, including the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions or any other action challenging any aspect of the detention of foreign detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, except for the narrow question of whether status review boards follow their own rules," said a press release from the American Civil Liberties Union.
In a last minute change of position, the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) has reversed its decision not to allow the Liberian National football team, The Lone Star, to attend Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Togo.
The NTGL had announced on Wednesday that the squad would not be able to travel to Lome, Togo because of a lack of funds to pay for the team's travel.
In a statement explaining its decision not to fund the team's travel, the NTGL highlighted more pressing financial obligations such as the country's upcoming national elections and the demobilization of the nation's defunct armed forces.
"As a result of the huge expenditure, the National Transitional Government of Liberia has decided it is unfeasible to underwrite the Lone Star's travel to Togo," said the Minister of Information, Dr. C. William Allen.
The decision to allow The Lone Star to travel to Lome was made after the price of the team's travel decreased from US$31,000 to US$18,000.
The team now plans to fly to Accra and take a bus to Lome versus fly the entire way.
Had Liberia failed to take the field on Sunday, the country would have faced fines of US$31,895 and possible prohibition from participating in the 2010 World Cup to be held in South Africa.
Incidentally, the fines would have been slightly more than the team's original travel budget.
Classified memos have revealed that the Bush administration knowingly endorsed enhanced interrogation techniques including waterboarding and other methods, that critics call torture, for use against terror suspects.
The memos were issued to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 as classified documents in response to the department's former director George Tenet's request for White House approval.
"The CIA believed then, and now, that the program was useful and helped save lives," commented a former CIA official, explaining the memos.
"But in the agency's view, it was like this:"
We don't want to continue unless you tell us in writing that it's not only legal but is the policy of the administration'.
In private meetings led by then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, top administration officials Vice President Cheney, Attorney General Ashcroft and several former members of the administration discussed the endorsement of the programs.
No one at the meetings had questioned the methods because the CIA had them "boxed in", a former official noted.
"They were saying, 'It's the only way to get the information we needed, and — by the way — we think there's another attack coming up'."
Another official, however, called the idea that the CIA had coerced the Bush administration into approving the torture methods "ridiculous".
The CIA, he said, understood the methods were "controversial and would be widely criticized if it became public".
Tenet said that in a 2001 meeting with top administration officials, Rice had warned those attending of an impending attack by a top Al-Qaeda suspect, Abu Zubaydah.
Bush had asked a CIA staffer if the methods really worked.
Ashcroft had commented during the meetings that "history will not judge us kindly".
Last month, Rice stated that there was concern over the legality of the program and that she was investigating if any laws had been broken.
On CNN's Anderson Cooper-hosted 360 Degrees program, former British Prime Minister John Major said, "I think it's now patently apparent that there are people in the United Kingdom (who) are alienated from the Anglo-Saxon way of life and are prepared to indulge in these dreadful acts of criminality."
Ekow Eshun of the Newstatesman writes that Major's comments belong on the dustheap of history along with cricket.
The former British leader has also been recently quoted as saying in reference to the Brazilian citizen killed by police; "I rather prefer the expression shoot to protect rather than shoot to kill — I think that is a more accurate description of what happened."
In addition Sir John has come out as an advocate of deportation for people who express distaste for the "Anglo-Saxon way of life".
The Saudi ambassador to London, Prince Turki al-Faisal, is voicing the same position as Major regarding the need for deporting some of the Muslim clerics.
In the 1960s there was born a somewhat similar "America, love it or leave it" viewpoint among American conservatives, a viewpoint that is still the subject of debate today.
A rupture in the underground stormwater drain system opened a huge sinkhole on February 23, killing three people and bringing down twelve houses in Guatemala City.
Teenagers Irma and David Soyos and their father, 53-year old Domingo Soyos were killed when their house collapsed into the sinkhole.
Nearly a thousand people were evacuated from the San Antonio neighborhood after the collapse.
Wikinews interviewed Eric Haddox, a civil engineer who has visited the site of the sinkhole and spoken to the engineers working on fixing the drain.
Mr. Haddox, who specialises in the building of earthworks, roads, water supply and sewage systems, and is working as a missionary in Guatemala, visited the site following the collapse to help in the recovery effort.
Mr. Haddox told us that the size of the hole is much smaller than the 330 feet depth originally reported and that the erosion causing the collapse is believed to have happened over a long time, and not just during the recent rains as initially suspected.
There are also concerns that a four-story building less than a metre from the edge of the hole may collapse as the earth under the building continues to be eroded.
Scientists at the Ohio University predicted that the ice sheets of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's tallest mountain peak, will melt in the next twenty years due to global warming.
The ice that was present in 1912 gradually decreased by 85% by 2000, and by 2007 another 26% of the amount in 2000.
This was the first time that the volume of the ice in Kilimanjaro was measured.
The tests were conducted by Lonnie Thompson, a professor at Ohio University.
"The fact that so many glaciers throughout the tropics and subtropics are showing similar responses suggests an underlying common cause," Thompson said.
Change in cloudiness and weather could have also been factors in the retreat of the ice, especially in recent decades, scientists said.
These findings were first published in the journal proceedings of United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on Monday.
Canada has a budget surplus of CA$13.8 billion for the 2006–2007 fiscal year, totaling 1% of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP), Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced today.
The record surplus was boosted by revenue from government corporations to $14.2 billion, far exceeding the government's projections of $9.2 billion and surpassing the record set by the previous year's $13.2 billion surplus.
By federal law, all surplus must be used to pay down Canada's debt, and is not available for spending.
$90 billion in debt payments over the last ten years have reduced its debt to $467 billion or 32.3% of national GDP, its lowest level in a quarter century.
The announced debt payment is the largest in Canadian history.
The payment also reduced Canada's annual interest payments by $725 million, which the government pledged to pass on to taxpayers through tax returns and reduced income taxes.
The Conservative's "Tax Back Guarantee", proposed in the March budget, promises that money saved on interest payments will be deducted from Canadians' taxes.
The Globe and Mail predicts the tax returns will be 30–40 dollars per taxpayer.
Canada has posted ten consecutive budget surpluses in the last decade.
The Canadian economy, the 8th largest in the world, has benefited from rising global demand for its export commodities, particularly oil and copper, as well as record corporate profits.
This surplus was further increased by a $700 million drop from expected government spending.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper cautioned that the Canadian economy is still facing "tough times" in its forestry, manufacturing, and some export industries.
Critics point out that the Conservative government had said Canadians were overtaxed when they took office, and had vowed to eliminate "surplus surprises".
President George W. Bush ordered Jose Padilla, detained by the US Military as an alleged terrorist, to be transferred out of military custody in order to face trial in a federal criminal court.
He is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, aiding terrorist groups and other acts against US nationals outside the United States.
These actions come six days ahead of a decision by the US Supreme Court on whether it should review the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling that the president is authorised to hold Padilla as an "Enemy Combatant" without charge.
Jose Padilla, a US citizen born in Brooklyn, has been held without charge in a military brig at a US Navy detention facility in South Carolina for the three-and-a-half years since his arrest in 2002.
The administration had at the time alleged that Padilla was plotting to detonate a Radioactive "dirty" bomb in the US and later, Deputy Attorney General James Comey alleged that he was involved in plots to blow up Hotels and high-rise buildings .
The present indictment does not include any charges over these allegations.
Instead, Padilla is charged with travelling abroad to train in "violent Jihad", providing material support to terrorists by sending money, physical assets, and new recruits to Jihadi groups, and conspiring to murder individuals overseas .
The change in custody restores to Padilla a number of rights he had been denied when the administration designated him as an "Enemy Combatant", including the right to access federal courts and be defended by an attorney.
That constitutionality of detaining suspects without charge under this designation has been challenged in court, on behalf of Padilla and in September, a 3-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the government's powers to detain Padilla.
The Supreme Court was set to decide on whether it will review that decision next week.
Padilla's status, for the purpose of this trial, is that of an ordinary criminal indictee, possessing the legal rights conferred on him by the US Bill of Rights.
Manouchehr Mottaki, the foreign minsister of Iran, did not attend a dinner at Sharm el-Sheikh because the red dress of a Ukrainian violinist did not meet the "Islamic standards."
According to Mottaki, "There was something wrong with that so I offered my apologies."
The planned discussion of Condoleezza Rice and Mottaki would have been the highest-level formal talks of U.S. and Iranian officials.
It was intended to enable the foreign ministers to thrash out ways to curb the security problems in Iraq.
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack explained the issue in term of intimidation when he said, "I don't know which woman he was afraid of, the woman in the red dress or the secretary of state."
In lieu of a longer substantive discussion, there was a 3-minute exchange of pleasantries between Rice and Mottaki at the end.
However, Rice did have a complete discussion with Walid Moallem, the foreign minister of Syria, to alleviate Iraq's security problems.
Later, Mottaki stated that Iran believes that the presence of American troops is the source of instability and called for the withdrawal of American troops.
He said, "The U.S. must issue a clear troop-withdrawal plan so that peace and stability can be restored."
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could claim victory in Sunday's House of Councillors elections.
The House of Councillors is the upper house in the bicameral National Diet of Japan.
Of the 242 seats, DPJ went from 82 to 109 seats, making it the largest party in the House of Councillors.
This gain came largely at the expense of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which went from 119 seats to 83.
Also losing seats was LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito Party (NKP), which lost 4 councillor seats and now holds 20.
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that while he takes the result of the election "very seriously," he does not intend to resign his post.
"We must take these results very seriously and reflecting on what we must reflect on," Abe said at a news conference.
"I want to fulfill my responsibility to proceed with reform to build the nation and promote economic growth that the people can feel."
The election result will not force the government out of power, since the LDP holds 296 of the 480 seats in the House of Representatives.
"Voters said we must reflect on our shortcomings and refresh the line-up," Abe said.
"I plan to reshuffle the Cabinet and top party posts at an appropriate time."
He really needs to accept the results of the election and think about the future.
"This might include quitting," 38-year-old civil servant Akihiro Kodaira told Reuters.
Portions of Wikileaks.org, the "uncensorable Wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis", has been blocked in Australia.
Wikinews has also learned that three URL links to Wikipedia, a free, online encyclopedia anyone can edit, have also been blocked.
Portions of the video sharing website YouTube have also been blocked.
The websites are among thousands of others that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), a government owned entity, block access to when using their blocking software.
The alleged three lists, from 2008 and 2009, were leaked to Wikileaks who published the documents.
Most of the blocked websites are ones hosting hardcore pornography.
According to their website, the ACMA's role in regards to the internet is to "address community concerns about offensive and illegal material online and, in particular, to protect children from exposure to material that is unsuitable for them."
Despite the alleged leak, Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in Australia, much of the listed websites were never an issue with the ACMA, but that some of the websites are.
He also goes on to say that anyone publishing the content of the ACMA's list will face criminal prosecution.
"I am aware of reports that a list of URLs has been placed on a website."
"ACMA is investigating this matter and is considering a range of possible actions it may take including referral to the Australian Federal Police."
"Any Australian involved in making this content publicly available would be at serious risk of criminal prosecution," said Conroy in a statement to the press.
Wikileaks insists the list is real and that publishing the three of them reflects what ones were added in the past, then removed or vice versa.
"Between the 11th and yesterday, the company did an enormous cleanup of the list."
"No doubt as a result of the list appearing on Wikileaks."
"Where the list previously contained over 2000 URLs, and Conroy and the ACMA claimed 'See! Our 'current list' never contained that many URLs', this new list is about the size the ACMA claimed it to be," said Wikileaks in a statement posted on their website.
Wikileaks recently leaked documents that revealed the ACMA's alleged list of 2,395 blocked websites, portions of Wikileaks being among them.
Of the three lists, the final one shows that the ACMA "cleaned up" their list, according to Wikileaks.
One of the blacklisted URLs to Wikileaks includes a leaked list of blocked websites in Denmark.
Not included on the list is the leaked list of blocked websites in Thailand.
"This week saw Australia joining China and the United Arab Emirates as the only countries censoring Wikileaks."
"Australian democracy must not be permitted to sleep with this loaded gun."
"If Australia's 'Senator for Censorship', Steven Conroy, has his way, Australia will be the first Western country to have a mandatory Internet censorship regime," said Wikileaks in another statement on their website.
"The first rule of censorship is that you cannot talk about censorship".
Portions of Wikipedia blocked include a photo taken by Wikinews contributor David Shankbone titled The making of an adult film by David Shankbone.
The URL was added to the ACMA's list on July 28, 2008.
However, Wikinews has learned that the file was deleted from Wikimedia Commons on January 21, by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales by "user request: Courtesy delete per request of uploader".
It was deleted more than one year after the ACMA added the URL to its list.
Other portions of Wikipedia that are blocked are pages belonging to users Cyde and Ewlyahoocom.
Wikinews contacted the ACMA for a statement, but as of this report, there was no response.
Wikinews also contacted Mr. Wales who confirmed the file was deleted because he was asked to do so.
"This had nothing to do with Australia," said Wales to Wikinews.
Wales did not say whether he was aware of the specific file linked to Wikipedia was being blocked.
The Wikipedia URLs appear on all three lists leaked by Wikileaks.
Another image, in the same photo set was also deleted by Mr. Wales on the same day, but that URL does not appear on the alleged ACMA list.
It underwent a request for deletion in 2008, which was later deleted despite it being discussed as 'keep'.
An anonymous source told Wikinews that the images were sexually explicit and featured three men, pornography star Michael Lucas, Rodrigo diCarli and Kurt Wild, having anal intercourse.
Shankbone told Wikinews that he has "no comment for this story."
Websites caught linking to or promoting websites on the ACMA's block list could face a fine of AU$11,000 per day if they don't remove the content in question within 24 hours of receiving a notice from the ACMA.
The same standard can be enforced on an international level.
Fines can be imposed on websites outside Australia that link to material on its list.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that started preliminary experiments on September 10, 2008 in CERN,Geneva, and the planned International Linear Collider (ILC) will carry out a series of experiments in the future to validate the standard model of particle physics.
The model predicts that Higgs boson particles gives mass to all fundamental particles and explains the existence of dark matter, or invisible matter in between galaxies.
The LHC is a 27 kilometer long circular high energy particle accelerator which took more than 20 years and USD $9 billion to build.
In the next few weeks the machine will collide opposing beams of protons charged with approximately 7 TeV of energy resulting in cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time, a re-creation of the Big Bang.
An upgraded version of the LHC was announced, nicknamed the "super LHC".
The new accelerator will perform ten times the number of collisions as the current LHC over the same time.
The upgrade will feature a new injection system and enhanced detectors to cope with the increase in data packets from collisions.
The bigger International Linear Collider, nicknamed "Einstein's telescope", is planned by the International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP).
The ILC will have a collision energy of 500 GeV and will collide electrons with particles of antimatter, called positrons, along a 30-40 km completely straight tunnel.
The ILC's two giant "guns" pointing at each other would be able to accelerate electrons and positrons to near-light speeds before smashing them together.
"The LHC smashes protons together to discover new particles but also generates lots of debris that obscures the fine detail."
"The ILC would be a much cleaner machine and tell us far more about their real nature."says Brian Foster, professor of experimental physics at Oxford University and European director of the project.
The host country for the ILC has not yet been chosen but it is planned to have the machine constructed by late 2010.
The new machine will cost an estimated USD $7 billion to build.
Physicists hope that ILC might be able to resolve some of the questions raised by Einstein's theories of relativity.
The Church of England are planning to allow gay men who are celibate and in a civil partnership to become bishops according to an announcement made by the House of Bishops.
This expands a previous decision made in 2005 allowing gay clergy with civil partners.
Whether gay clergyman would be allowed to become bishops became an issue in 2003 with the appointment of Rev Jeffrey John as Bishop of Reading.
Jeffrey John was forced to step down from his position and now serves as Dean of St Albans Cathedral.
In 2010, he was also a candidate to become Bishop of Southwark but was rejected, allegedly because of his sexual orientation.
Anglican evangelicals have suggested such a change ought to have been passed by the General Synod rather than the House of Bishops.
Chris Sugden from Anglican Mainstream said the change coming from the House of Bishops "looks too much like salami-slicing away at the Church's teaching".
Former Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali raised questions about what celibacy means for a gay bishop: "Does the admission of those in civil partnerships to the episcopate, who state they are celibate, include those who were previously in actively homophile relationships including with their present partner?"
"The House of Bishops statement does not elaborate on this point but it is crucial to an understanding of what celibacy might mean in this context."
In November, the General Synod voted against proposals to allow the appointment of women as bishops.
Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has announced a moratorium on executions, and will begin to seek their abolition.
On January 14, 2010, in a speech to parliament, Elbegdorj announced that he would pardon all persons sentenced to death, stating that most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty, and Mongolia should follow suit.
He also suggested that the death penalty be replaced with a 30 year prison sentence.
The decision was controversial: when Elbegdorj finished his speech, representatives of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party refused to join in the applause, which is customary after a presidential address to parliament.
Human rights groups welcomed the move, with Amnesty International expressing hope that Mongolia will vote in favour of an upcoming United Nations resolution calling for an end to Capital punishment.
It also urged other nations in the region to abolish the death penalty.
Many members of Mongolia's opposition-led parliament favour harsh punishments for criminals, and Elbegdorj must gain approval from parliament before the death penalty can be abolished.
If Elbegdorj fails to be re-elected, the new president could end the moratorium, and executions could resume.
The UN Security Council will "mostly likely" adopt a non-binding statement later today on North Korea's announcement of planned nuclear bomb tests; the statement does not explicitly mention the threat of sanctions.
This was announced by the Security Council president late yesterday.
Japan's UN envoy Kenzo Oshima, who chairs the 15-member body this month, said council experts made "good progress" in efforts to fine tune a Japanese draft, but said they had yet to finalize it.
"Most likely we will have something adopted (Friday)" once council members consult their respective capitals for "final clearance," he added.
Earlier on Thursday, Japan and the United States pushed for a threat to resort to mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
China and Russia (two veto members of the Council) however, voted against the sanctions.
It is hoped that the latest text will urge Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear tests and return back to six-party talks "without precondition".
North Korea had earlier boycotted the talks in response to a sanction placed by the US on one of its banks, believed to linked to the regime of Kim Jong-Il.
North Korea claims it has nuclear weapons, although this has not yet been independently verified.
Police apprehended a 18 inch tall monkey that is reported to have bitten a 20 year-old woman outside State Street Brats, a Madison, Wisconsin nightclub.
The long-tailed, black and white monkey, which was wearing a diaper, was leashed in a beer garden outside the nightclub on State Street when people began to pet the animal.
When the woman approached the monkey around 1:00 a.m. CDT (UTC-5) on Wednesday morning and put her hand out to pet it, it bit her then escaped the garden and led police on a seven hour 'monkey hunt' before it was caught.
The woman was left with four puncture wounds to her thumb.
Doctors are said to be testing blood samples from the monkey to check for diseases.
"This guy was in the beer garden at State Street Brats letting women pet his monkey," said a spokesman for the Madison police Department, Joel DeSpain.
Police say the monkey will remain in quarantine for at least ten days.
PepsiCo Inc. is in line to get its first female chief executive before the end of the year.
Steven S. Reinemund, chairman and CEO of the U.S. soft drink and snack food giant, announced his retirement via press release effective in May, 2007.
Reinemund, 58, said he was leaving to spend more time with his family.
The same PepsiCo release confirmed that Indra Nooyi, currently president and CFO, will take over for Reinemund.
The first is scheduled to be filled by Richard Goodman, 57, currently CFO of PepsiCo International, who will become CFO.
Hugh Johnston, 44, currently senior vice president of transformation, was promoted to the newly created post of executive vice president of operations, procurement and information technology.
Nooyi, 50, is a Yale-educated daughter of a middle class Indian family, according to her official biography.
She is scheduled to succeed Reinemund, in October, the company said.
Together, Nooyi and Reinemund have guided PepsiCo through several large take-overs and has seen the company overtake The Coca-Cola Company both in terms of sales and market value.
Coca-Cola is still the No. 1 soft drink maker based on U.S. and global market share.
A significant portion of PepsiCo's sales revenue comes from non-drink brands in its Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats product lines.
Some on Wall Street were surprised by Reinemund's retirement announcement, according to news reports.
Monday, the stock (ticker:PEP) closed up $0.62 at $63.95 per share on the NYSE.
A researcher at the University of Oxford has found a saucy poem attributed to John Milton, the 17th-century poet who wrote Paradise Lost and other religious verse.
"An Extempore Upon a Faggot", discovered in an 18th-century anthology of poetry, is not thought by modern scholars to be by Milton, however, and may in fact have been written by one of his rivals in an attempt to disgrace him.
The poem was found by Dr Jennifer Batt, who said that it "is so out of tune with the rest of his work, that if the attribution is correct, it would prompt a major revision of our ideas about Milton."
She discovered the rude verse in the Harding Collection of poetry anthologies held by the Bodleian Library, the main university library at Oxford.
"To see the name of John Milton, the great religious and political polemicist, attached to such a bawdy epigram, is extremely surprising to say the least", she added.
The book in question, the Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany from 1708 (over 30 years after Milton's death), was described by another Oxford academic, Dr Abigail Williams, as "a set of poems written by witty young men about town for witty young men about town".
Milton wrote in blank verse rather than using rhyme and used differing poetic rhythms, whereas the handwritten poem uses a simple pattern of rhyming couplets as it contrasts the sexual behaviour of young women and more experienced women by comparing them to green wood and dry wood upon a fire.
Have you not in a Chimney seen 
A Faggot which is moist and green
 How coyly it receives the Heat
 And at both ends do's weep and sweat? 
 So fares it with a tender Maid
 When first upon her Back she's laid 
But like dry Wood th' experienced Dame
 Cracks and rejoices in the Flame
Milton (1608–1674) wrote many influential religious poems, including Paradise Lost, which is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as "widely and rightly regarded as the supreme poetic achievement in the English language, fit to sit alongside the poems of Homer, Virgil, and Dante."
It tells the story of the fall from grace of Adam and Eve in an epic theological poem.
He followed it with Paradise Regained, depicting the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness.
Bawdy poetry is not thought by modern academics to be in keeping with Milton's style, with Batt suggesting that it is likely that his name was added to the poem "to bring scandal upon [him], perhaps by a jealous contemporary."
She suggests that the culprit might have been Sir John Suckling, a poet who was a supporter of the monarchy, in contrast to the Republican Milton.
The University of Oxford is currently digitising the songbooks and anthologies of the Harding Collection, said to be the world's largest such collection, as part of a project to allow online access.
It is named after Walter Harding, a British musician who collected music and poetry in Chicago.
The poem had been read before, but without anyone noticing Milton's name at the bottom.
Dr Williams, the project's leader, expressed her doubts as to the authenticity of the attribution, commenting that "[y]ou could become very rich and famous – well, famous, anyway – if you could prove the rhyme was really by Milton."
Progress M-08M, an unmanned Russian cargo spacecraft, departed for the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to resupply the orbital outpost.
The rocket carrying the craft, a Soyuz-U, lifted off at 7:11 pm Moscow time (15:11 GMT).
Russian Space Agency officials deemed the launch a success after the Progress successfully achieved orbit and separated from the third stage of the rocket.
Docking of the spacecraft with the ISS is expected to occur on Saturday.
The Progress will deliver more than 2.5 metric tons of supplies and essentials to the orbiting American-Russian crew, as well as gifts and letters from the crew members' families.
Mount Stromlo, Canberra — Yesterday in Capital Punishment, the Canberra 50km and 100km mountain bike race, Andy Blair won in the 100km distance in 3:30:25 ahead of Dylan Cooper and Shaun Lewis, last year's winner.
In the women's event, Jenny Fay won in a time of 4:01:53 ahead of Michelle Ainsworth.
Competitors start at Sparrow Hill east of Canberra, and ride through Canberra the Black Mountain Reserve and the National Arboretum, ending at Stromlo Forest Park.
There were a variety of cyclists of different skill levels including former Australian national team members, but casual cyclists were very much in evidence.
Former Major League Baseball pitcher and coach Pat Dobson died of leukemia Wednesday, November 22.
He died at age 64 at a local San Diego hospital only a day after being diagnosed with the disease.
Dobson is best known for winning 20 games in the 1971 season for the Baltimore Orioles.
Dobson finished his 11 year career with a career win-loss record of 122-129 and with a 3.54 ERA in eleven seasons.
Dobson later became a pitching coach for several teams, last appearing for the Orioles in 1996.
At his death he was a special assistant to San Francisco Giants general manager Brian Sabean, where he worked the past nine years.
The British Assets Recovery Agency is investigating £30 million / €44 million of assets believed to be owned by senior members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA or IRA), using information provided by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau and British and Irish law enforcement agencies.
The money is believed to represent a small fraction of the wealth obtained by the organisation.
Most of the assets are believed to have been owned by the IRA chief of staff, Thomas Murphy and businessman Dermot Craven.
Now that negotiations over weapons decommissioning are over, it is believed that other IRA members who have become rich through running protection rackets or other criminal activities may also be stripped of their illegal assests in the forthcoming weeks.
Businesses and organisations paying money towards protection rackets are hoping that the structure of the IRA will now begin to unravel.

On Friday, all six major American television networks; ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, WB, and UPN, along with most PBS stations, united in a rare show of solidarity to air a one hour charity concert called Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast.
The concert aired live at 8pm in the Eastern time zone and 7pm in the Central time zone and on tape-delay in the Mountain and Pacific time zones.
It was also shown on the Internet and many cable networks such as USA, Bravo and G4.
The show was produced by Joel Gallen, the same man behind the September 11th tribute concert America: A Tribute to Heroes.
The show was not censored for political statements but was for obscenities.
Last week, rapper Kayne West made a remark on an NBC charity show A Concert for Hurricane Relief, in which West claimed that "George Bush doesn't care about black people.", which caused controversy.
Throughout the concert there were notable acts, such U2 performing "One" with Mary.
Another moment was Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood and the house band from The Late Show with David Letterman doing a cover of John Fogerty's "Who'll Stop The Rain".
Donations were being solicited for the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army.
Telecom company AT&T provided toll-free calling and 10 call centers for the event and MCI provided volunteers from their call centers.
BET also held a charity concert called S.O.S (Saving OurSelves), a half-hour before cutting to the main one.
MTV, MTV Overdrive, VH1 and CMT will air a charity show Saturday called ReAct Now: Music & Relief.
The King of Jordan, King Abdullah, dissolved the country's parliament on Tuesday, half-way through its four year term, and called for early general elections to be held, up to two years ahead of schedule.
The monarch did not immediately provide a reason for the move; however, there have recently been reports accusing the parliament of handling legislation ineptly, and even of being corrupt.
The king's decree ordered the civil service to host new elections to replace the 110-member parliament, although an exact date for the polls hasn't yet been named.
Critics of the parliament have said that its members didn't properly address issues such as unemployment and poverty.
The opposition, however, asserted that the house had been disbanded so that the government could use emergency laws to pass legislation.
King Abdullah has now disbanded the parliament two times since he came to power in 1999.
The Nine Network has announced the death of one of Australia's richest men, Kerry Packer, aged 68.
Announcer Richard Wilkins said on the Today Show that he had just been handed official confirmation of Mr Packer's death at 68.
He said a statement from Tony Ritchie, Nine head of news, said: "Mrs Kerry Packer and her children James and Gretel sadly report the passing last evening of her husband and their father Kerry."
"He died peacefully at home with his family at his bedside".
Packer was the major shareholder in Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) which owns the Nine television network and Australian Consolidated Press, the producer of many Australian and New Zealand magazines.
Packer was also involved in the gambling and tourism industries and owned the Crown Casino in Melbourne.
In the 1970s, his World Series Cricket revolutionised cricket, bringing One-day cricket to the fore by introducing things such as coloured uniforms, white balls & day/night matches.
Business Review Weekly magazine estimated Packer's net worth at AU$6.5 billion in 2004.
Another famous rich Australian media magnate, who may have lost his Australian nationality, is Rupert Murdoch.
US lawmakers have reached a last-minute deal to avoid a government shutdown, which would have begun at 12:00 EDT (04:00 UTC) Saturday.
The agreement, announced just one hour before the shutdown was to occur, includes US$38.5 billion in budget reductions.
Earlier on Friday, US legislators deflected claims that a midnight deal was being worked out, but Republican Party sources later reported that a deal was likely to be reached.
The deal was apparently reached after disputes over government funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood were resolved.
Boehner said both sides decided on a six-day extension, or "bridge," of government funding, which would allow Congress to work out a final solution to last the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year, which ends in September.
Voting for the resulting agreement will take place some time next week, according to Boehner.
The last complete US government shutdown occurred in 1995, during the administration of Bill Clinton, lasting five days; it was proceeded by a 21-day partial shutdown.
In the event of a government shutdown, essential federal employees are still required to work, but nonessential personnel are placed on unpaid furloughs.
Essential staff include military personnel, air traffic controllers, emergency officials, and intelligence officials.
Republican candidates for President of the United States Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry have failed to qualify to be on the ballot for the Virginia primary election, scheduled for March 6, Super Tuesday.
Gingrich, former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Perry, Governor of Texas, did not submit the 10,000 signatures, with at least 400 from each of the state's eleven congressional districts, to the state's board of elections before the 5:00 PM deadline last Thursday required to gain ballot access, according to the Republican Party of Virginia.
Gingrich's and Perry's campaigns both claimed to have more signatures than needed, 11,050 and 11,911 respectively.
Volunteers spent last night reviewing the submitted petitions and validating signatures.
Reportedly Rick Perry is considering an appeal of the assessment.
Among other major candidates for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney and Texas congressman Ron Paul submitted the required petition and qualified for the ballot.
On Thursday, it was disclosed that candidates Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum also failed to gain ballot access.
According to the manager of the Gingrich campaign, Michael Krull, the former House Speaker plans to compete in the Virginia primary, despite not gaining ballot access, as a write-in candidate.
Krull blamed a "failed system" for the campaign's inability to gain ballot access.
Rick Perry's campaign manager said he was disappointed by that campaign's failure to qualify for the ballot.
According to a recent poll of 489 Republican voters by Quinnipiac University, Gingrich leads in the state with 30% of support, followed by Mitt Romney at 25% and Ron Paul at 9%.
As Virginia's delegates to the Republican National Convention are not awarded on a winner-take-all basis, candidates other than the winner of the state's primary could also gain delegates from the state.
Hans and Josie Schaffer of Bedford, United Kingdom are possibly world record holders, now that they have a total of 99 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
The pensioners spend most of the year saving for Christmas gifts.
Their eleven children have brought them 56 grandchildren and 43 great-grandchildren.
"The kids just kept coming – and then their kids just kept coming," said Josie, 77, to the Sun newspaper.
Husband Hans was a prisoner of war in World War II, and went to work as a farmer for Josie's family.
While there is no existing record with Guinness for alive couples with the most grandchildren, Guinness World Records authorities say the couple very well might hold the record.
Glasgow resident Margaret McMillan had 123 grandchildren, but died last year at 98.
It wasn't until her funeral that the number, which included 15 great-great-grandchildren, was established by the family.
