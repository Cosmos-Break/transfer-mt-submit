It has been confirmed that eight thoroughbred race horses at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney have been infected with equine influenza.
Randwick has been locked down, and is expected to remain so for up to two months.
It is expected that the virulent flu will affect the majority of the 700 horses stabled at Randwick.
NSW Minister for Primary Industries said the facility would be quarantined until 30 days after the last sign of the flu.
The cases are the first infections of race horses, despite infecting dozens of recreational horses across NSW and Queensland.
The flu is highly contagious but cannot be transmitted to humans.
The national racing shutdown was costing the industry tens of millions of dollars every day.
Chief Executive of Racing NSW, Peter V'Landys said while racing had been disrupted since a ban on horse movements last weekend today was a "grim, black day" for the racing industry in NSW.
Racing is expected to resume in all Australian states except NSW and Queensland on the weekend.
While Sydney's spring racing carnival has been canceled, Melbourne's is expected to kick off this weekend with the Caufield Cup.
The cup will be ran with special precautions in place to attempt to keep the state free of the virus.
Contact between the general public and those working with the horses will be banned and Sydney-based jockeys Darren Beadman and Hugh Bowman and a number of interstate trainers including Bart Cummings are not allowed to take part.
Federal Minister for Agriculture, Peter McGauran said the spring carnival in Melbourne will remain "largely intact" despite losing some of the biggest names in Australian racing.
At least 11 people were killed Dec. 26 and 27 in neighborhood gang turf fights between drug dealers at shantytown "morro da Mineira" (Miner Hill) in the Catumbi neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The region is controlled by rival gang Comando Vermelho (Red Command), which does not approve of other gangs selling drugs in the region.
Comando Vermelho members started attacking the rival members of ADA to protect their turf.
On Friday evening, an explosion in Chengdu, China caused partial shutdown of a facility operated by Foxconn, one of the world's biggest electronics manufacturers and a major supplier to companies like Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Sony, Apple, Motorola and Nokia.
Initial investigations now suggest the explosion was caused by poor ventilation, which lead to high concentrations of combustible dust.
The blast happened at 7:18PM, around the time workers change shifts.
At least three people were killed, at least fifteen injured.
Foxconn halted production to investigate, saying "All operations at the affected workshop remain suspended and production at all other workshops that carry out similar processing functions have also been halted pending the results of the investigation. "
"All other production operations in our facilities in China continue operating normally."
On Monday, city officials gave the cause as combustible dust in the air at a polishing workshop.
Hong Kong-based labor rights group Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior said they reported aluminium dust problems in March when they reviewed working conditions at Foxconn.
After the explosion, they commented that workers were complaining "the ventilation of the department is poor. "
"In the process, there is lots of aluminum (aluminium) dust floating in the air. "
"Workers always breathe in aluminum dust even though they put on masks. "
"When workers take off their cotton gloves, their hands are covered with aluminum dust."
Foxconn responded by saying the group was trying to "capitalize on the tragic accident" and misrepresented "Foxconn's commitment to the health and safety of our employees."
Research group IHS iSuppli said the explosion may cause loss of production of 500,000 iPads during this quarter of the year.
They said there is a larger facility in Shenzhen , but it cannot cope with re-compensating the possible loss.
A magnitude 5.8 earthquake has struck in a place where earthquakes are rare, but sometimes large.
According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), at 3:35 p.m (eastern time) the 5.8 quake struck in Antarctica, 105 kilometers (65 miles) south, southeast of Casey Station or 2565 kilometers (1590 miles) north of the South Pole.
The quake was reported at a depth of 7.5 k.m. (4.7 miles), but the USGS says it was "poorly constrained."
Had any civilization existed on the frozen ice cap, the USGS says that damage could be "light to moderate."
Antarctica's biggest earthquake was a magnitude 8.1 which occurred on March 25, 1998 near the Balleny Islands of Antarctica.
Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin accused the Transnistrian authorities on Saturday of having supplied Russian weapons to Iraq during the regime of Saddam Hussein, Russian news agencies have said.
Chisinau "holds official documents from the chancellery of Saddam Hussein, which show that Transnistria had supplied both arms, and entire weapon manufacturing lines to Iraq," Voronin told a group of Russian journalists, adding that an investigation on this case is under way.
"Russia's control over this territory is obvious and we must call to account those who do not desire to solve this conflict", Voronin added.
Being asked what Russia must do to help solve the conflict, the Moldovan President said that it must take the munitions from that territory.
"We consider this depot a political shield that supports the Transnistrian regime," the President emphasized.
Voronin added Moldova can prove Tiraspol sold weapons to Iraq.
"The document from Hussein's archive that can confirm this is being studied by the Moldovan authorities now," he said.
Voronin accused Moscow to settle this regional conflict, noting that Russian weapons are "a political coverage to protect the Transnistrian regime."
The Moldovan leader noted that he has sent a package of documents to Russia regarding the activity of 13 Transnistrian military companies.
On the other hand, Moldovan Premier Vasile Tarlev accused Thursday the Russian troops in Transnistria of supplying weapons to the Chechen region, In reply, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov said that he "pledges his head" for Russian bases in Moldova, and assured that "no weapons from Transnistria had been sent."
Fabio Capello has emerged as the new favourite to succeed Steve McClaren as the England football team's new head coach after José Mourinho ruled himself out of taking the job.
The former Chelsea manager had been widely regarded as a favourite for the job but after he admitted yesterday that he is no longer interested in it, Capello became the new favourite.
The Italian, who has previously managed Real Madrid, AC Milan, Juventus and Roma, would regard the England job as the highlight of his career according to sources close to him and is ready to open talks.
Other candidates for the job include fellow Italian Marcello Lippi, former Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann and Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill.
He said that $100 dollars per barrel was a "fair" price and remembered that when he assumed presidency of Venezuela in 1999, the price went up to about ten dollars.
The prices of raw oil approached $100 last week before settling down again.
Some observers think it is possible that the $100 barrier may be broken.
During the trading session following this two-day summit, that is expected to result in the "Declaration of Riyadh", the price of petroleum rose $0.80 in the New York market and $0.66 in London.
The United Nations (UN) on Friday called on the government of Pakistan to investigate numerous killings and abductions, particularly of journalists.
"In the past eight days alone we have received reports on the killing of one journalist, Munir Shakir, in Balochistan on August 14 2011, and the disappearance of another journalist, Rehmatullah Daparkhel, three days earlier in North Waziristan on August 11," said spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, nine journalists have been killed in Pakistan this year, and at least 16 were killed in 2010.
None of the killings had been investigated satisfactorily, Colville said.
Colville said that the UN would like to see the government review all of the incidents.
"We call on all responsible parties to immediately stop such violations of human rights, and we urge the government to take immediate steps to independently investigate these cases," he said.
Amnesty International has also urged the government of Pakistan to ensure the protection of journalists and media workers in the country.
They have further called upon the Pakistani authorities to investigate attacks on journalists and to try those responsible in line with internationally recognised standards of human rights.
Colville said that the recent attacks on journalists were not uncommon in Pakistan and that many journalist groups regard the country as one of the most dangerous places to work.
Shakir was shot dead after covering a protest organized by a Baloch separatist organization.
Irshad Matsoi, the bureau chief for the Online News Network where Shakir worked, said that the killing was linked to the journalist’s work.
Journalism in Balochistan is becoming "an endangered profession," Matsoi said.
Reporters Without Borders (RWB) have appealed for punishment of those responsible for the murder.
According to RWB, journalists do not feel free to report in Balochistan, which has led to self-censorship in the region.
The whereabouts of Daparkhel, kidnapped on August 11, is still unknown.
The worldwide press freedom organization said that the government must do everything they can to find him immediately.
"It is unacceptable that local journalists have to do the job of the police and investigate on their own using their contacts," the organization said.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has condemned the incidents.
"There is a growing sense of insecurity among media persons who increasingly interpret each attack on journalists as a warning to ‘behave,’" the HRCP said last Monday.
The HRCP also said that in almost all cases of violence against journalists in the last few years, those responsible have not been identified or punished.
"The HRCP calls upon the government to respond through effective action and not mere words in the next few days, sending a strong message to the mischief makers that it would no longer stand by as a mere spectator as journalists are killed and snatched," the Commission said.
A 6.5 magnitude earthquake has hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The tremor, lasting about 2 minutes, sparked panic in numerous seaside communities on the island.
According to officials, no injuries have been reported but sea water levels have risen up to four meters in areas.
Though precise details of the earthquake are still unclear, the US Geological Survey has said the tremor just after 0800 local time (0000 UTC) was 10km (6 mi) beneath the sea bed.
Local meteorological officials have reported to the Associated Press news agency the earthquake had been 37km (23 mi) under the Sea of Flores.
Saddam Hussein pleaded "not guilty" at the opening of the al-Dujail trial on Wednesday.
The court recessed for 6 weeks during which time his defense will be prepared.
During the proceeding, Hussein argued that the judge was not appointed by him, and thus was not legitimate.
A tribunal of five Iraqi judges headed by Rizgar Mohammed Amin, with the death penalty vested in them, will decide his sentence.
Recently Canadian MP Belinda Stronach had an affair with Tie Domi, a former NHL player.
She had refused to answer direct questions about her personal life.
Now for the first time since her affair, with Tie Domi, she sat down with CBC's George Stroumboulopoulos on his show The Hour to answer his questions about the affair, politics, and other topics during the nine minute chat, on October 9th.
No transcripts of this interview are officially available but, a video (see CBC source below) can be viewed.
An act signed into law by Afghan President Hamid Karzai last month dramatically rolled back the rights of women in that country, according to human rights groups and a United Nations report on the bill by the United Nations Development Fund for Women.
The Afghan government has not provided a copy of the text of the Shia Family Law to the UN or to other outside groups requesting it, citing "technical problems", however, the UN and opposition politicians say that the bill contains numerous provisions restricting the rights of women, such as giving their husbands priority in court; requiring the husband's permission to leave the house, obtain education or employment, or to see a doctor; and reserving the custody of children to male relatives.
Three people were hospitalized with injuries after a series of explosions at Southwest Industrial Gases, Inc., a gas facility in Dallas, Texas.
Tanks of oxygen, helium and acetylene began to explode after a connector used to join acetylene tanks during the filling process malfunctioned.
The explosions sent flaming debris into the air and onto buildings and expressways.
Black smoke that could be seen for miles billowed from the facility.
The problem began around 9:30 a.m CDT (UTC-5) at a loading dock, according to Dallas Fire Department Lt. Joel Lavender, and then spread to a trailer housing some 100,000 cubic feet (approximately 28,300 cubic metres) of gas.
Authorities evacuated an area that was one-half of a mile (approximately 800 m) wide.
Portions of Interstate 35 and Interstate 30 were shut down.
Flaming debris ignited small grass fires next to the roads.
Tanks were reported to have landed as far away as four blocks.
Officials for the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as local and state environmental officials, have deemed air quality levels acceptable following the blast.
Hazardous material crews have blocked water used in the fire from entering the Dallas storm drains.
"I just advised my teams to get out," said Eddy Parker of Airgas which operates right next to Southwest Industrial.
"Then we turned and ran and just kept hearing explosions."
"Given the fact that there haven’t been any fatalities, it seems like our fire department and emergency responders did a great job."
"But we need to let the fire department look at why this is occurring there in that area," said City Councilman Steve Salazar.
Two of the injured men, Randal Bibb, 52, and Daniel McMurry, 56, were taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital to be treated for upper-body burns.
The third, an unidentified truck-driver, was treated and released at Methodist Dallas Medical Center.
He hurt his back when he jumped from the cab of his truck.
The 12-year-old son of neuroscientist and MIT graduate Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, Mohammad Ahmed, was handed over to his aunt Fauzia Siddiqui in Islamabad after years of detention in a US military base in Afghanistan.
Dr. Aafia Siddiqui is still currently facing trial charged with attempting to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.
Siddiqui and her three children disappeared after leaving her parent's house in Karachi on 30th March, 2003.
She was married to a nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the September 11 attacks.
Her husband was captured in 2003 and is now held at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center.
In 2004, Dr. Aafia was identified by the FBI as an "Al-Qaeda operative and facilitator who posed a clear and present danger to America".
Mohammad Ahmed was only six when he and his mother, brother and sister were abducted from Karachi in 2003 and later handed over to US authorities.
Dr. Fauzia told journalists after the boy had been given to her by officials of the interior ministry and intelligence agencies.
Mohammad Ahmed arrived at the Benazir International Airport in Islamabad from Kabul in a PIA flight and was taken to his aunt’s residence.
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan co-chairman Iqbal Haider said that the daughter of Dr. Aafia was also in Afghanistan.
He regretted that despite having U.S. nationality, the U.S. government did nothing for the release of its four citizens, stating that "this is [a] severe violation of the US laws and constitution."
Muhammad Ahmed landed back to his home in Karachi from where he had disappeared five years back, with his family. 
Dr. Fauzia and her family are hoping that the other two missing children would also be back home soon, by taking some positive steps from the Government of Pakistan.
Two Palestinian families who have been living in East Jerusalem since 1956, were evicted from their homes on Sunday after an Israeli court rejected their appeal filed against the eviction.
The eviction comes after increasing international pressure on Israel to stop settlement activity and end home evictions.
Israeli security forces entered the homes at 6:00 a.m. (local time) and forcibly removed the family and international activists who were also living in the homes.
Al Jazeera reports that a family was beaten with batons as they tried to get back into their house.
JTA reports that Jewish families moved into the homes shortly after the Palestinian families were evicted.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has laid biblical claim to the areas of East Jerusalem and has stated that Jews have the right to live anywhere in the city.
Although Jerusalem is internationally recognized as occupied territory, Israel continues to evict Palestinians and instead build Jewish only apartments in the area, an action which is considered to be illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention.
Israel has plans for 350 new apartment buildings in East Jerusalem.
U.N special coordinator for Middle East Peace, Robert Serry, condemned the evictions as "totally unacceptable".
The international community, including the United States, has called on Israel to stop settlement activity and allow for the creation of a Palestinian state.
A fifth child has died as a result of a police pursuit that ended in a crash in Dinuba, California on Sunday, August 9.
Carlos Eric Salazar, aged 8, was the eighth victim to die as a result of the crash.
On Sunday, four children were among seven that were killed when the pursued suspect who, after refusing to stop for police, slammed into the GMC Sierra pickup truck carrying a family, two adults and five children.
The family was on their way to attend a football game for youths when the crash occurred.
Four of the children were ejected from the truck and died at the scene.
The two adults and one child were taken to Community Regional Medical Center located in Fresno.
Both vehicles collided with lemon trees at an orchard near the intersection of Avenue 424 and Road 120 in Dinuba.
Three people, including the suspect, were in a stolen 2005 Dodge Neon and also died at the scene.
Their identities are not yet known as none of them were carrying identification.
The other children were named Sienna Salazar aged 1, Michael aged 3, Monique aged 4 and Jocelyn aged 7.
The two adults, Carlos Salazar Jr., 29, and Jennifer, 26, remain in the hospital where they are recovering from their injuries.
None of the victims in the pickup were wearing seat belts, according to Fox News.
The official results of the 2007 Ontario General Election now show that the Ontario Liberal Party has been re-elected.
The Liberal Party lead by Dalton McGuinty will spend the next four years in a majority government.
McGuinty is the first Liberal premier to have back-to-back majorities since Mitchell Hepburn, who held office from 1934-1942, with his second majority starting in 1937.
Hepburn's government legacy includes the Queen Elizabeth Way and Rainbow Bridge to Niagara Falls, New York.
Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria, the leader of Egypt's Coptic Christian church, has died at the age of 88.
His funeral was held at a packed in Cairo today.
The mass featured hymns, prayers and incense-burning as crowds in and outside the cathedral paid their respects.
A large police presence watched over the scenes as mourners wept.
Field Marshal , presently leader of Egypt, has made today a day of mourning.
The Coptic Church is among the world's oldest and traces its roots to St Mark in the first century.
Shenouda spent 40 years as pope to the Coptics, who make up the majority of the nation's estimated ten million Christians.
Much of this time was spent pacifying his followers in the wake of violence and perceived discrimination, whilst working with the majority Muslims.
He spent three years exiled in the cathedral after claims of sectarian troublemaking from then-President in 1981.
With Mubarak gone, many Copts are concerned that Islamist political parties gaining new influence could mark a time of trouble for their religion.
"He left us an example of leadership that we should all follow," a cleric told the congregation at the fourth-century cathedral.
"It is because of him that we have national unity with our Muslim brothers".
Traffic was congested around the cathedral, which the pope remained fond of, while services were ongoing today.
Shenouda was dressed in full regalia, complete with a gold crown.
His body was taken to a military airfield and was to be taken to desert monastery St Bishoy for burial.
Tributes have been paid to Pope Shenouda as thousands of people mourned his death.
President of the United States Barack Obama said in a statement "We will remember Pope Shenouda III as a man of deep faith, a leader of a great faith, and an advocate for unity and reconciliation…" 
"His commitment to Egypt's national unity is also a testament to what can be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together."
According to BBC News Online more than 300 people were detained and at least 10 hurt after a second night of riots in Estonia's capital, Tallinn.
Clashes began last night after Estonian authorities removed a controversial Soviet monument, the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, which Russian-speaking Estonians see as a symbol of the liberation of Eastern Europe from Nazism, while Estonian nationalists view it as a reminder of Soviet occupation.
A wax model of British singer Amy Winehouse was unveiled on Wednesday at Madame Tussauds in London.
The model, nearly six feet tall and clad in a yellow dress with a microphone in hand, is said to bear a strong likeness to the singer.
Her tattoos have even been reproduced to the last detail, including one of a lightning bolt.
While her parents attended the event, Winehouse herself was too busy working to attend.
Her father Mitch remarked that "This is the reward for her musical achievements and her talent".
The troubled singer, 24, is well known for her drug use, and last month was thought to have been suffering from the early stages of emphysema.
Pope Benedict XVI has announced that he will be coming to the United Kingdom in January 2010.
The information was announced that the Pope had accepted an invitation to visit the United Kingdom from Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
The latter had visited the Vatican City three times and had invited the Pope to come to Great Britain in February 2009.
Downing Street is expected to confirm the arrangements later today.
This visit would make the first Papal visit to the UK since Pope John Paul II's visit in 1982.
However, John Paul's visit was on a pastoral basis, so this is set to be the first state visit to the UK by a pope in that it is the first to follow an official invitation.
John Paul's six-day tour through England, Scotland and Wales was hugely popular, attracting hundreds of thousands of people from the Catholic religion.
It became the first ever UK visit from the Pope, which will make Pope Benedict's visit the second papal one.
John Paul's visit was likely to be cancelled due to the Falklands War and assasination attempts.
American author and producer Michael Crichton has died in Los Angeles, California at the age of 66, according to a statement released by his family.
According to Entertainment Tonight, Crichton died after a long and quiet battle with cancer.
While the world knew him as a great storyteller that challenged our preconceived notions about the world around us — and entertained us all while doing so — his wife Sherri, daughter Taylor, family and friends knew Michael Crichton as a devoted husband, loving father and generous friend who inspired each of us to strive to see the wonders of our world through new eyes, said a statement by his family.
Crichton, who was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1942, was most famous for the writing of his Jurassic Park novels.
He also published The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Rising Sun, Timeline, Eaters of the Dead, all of which became major motion pictures.
He also created, and was an active executive producer of the hit television show ER.
On Wednesday North Korea's official media dropped Kim Jong Il's honourific title "Dear leader", reported Japan's Radiopress.
It was only days after the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported that portraits of Kim Jong Il have recently been removed from public display in North Korea.
According to Radiopress, a Japanese news agency that monitors North Korea's radio broadcasts, the North's Korean Central Broadcasting Station, as well as the Korean Central News Agency and other North Korean media, have stopped using the term "Dear leader" when referring to Kim Jong Il, the country's supreme leader.
Now the media in North Korea only use the official titles "General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea", " the Chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission" and/or "Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army" when referring to Kim.
Earlier Itar-Tass also reported that according to an unnamed foreign diplomat in Pyongyang, Kim Jong Il's portraits have recently been taken down from public display secretly and without explanation.
However, the portraits of Kim's father, Kim Il Sung, still remain, according to the same report.
This report has been confirmed by some expatriates living in the country.
This recent development in North Korea has given rise to speculation among analysts, some of whom suspected that these may be a sign that Kim is losing power, or that a power struggle is going on among the top leaders of the totalitarian state.
But most observers believe that the portraits were taken down by the order of Kim Jong Il himself, who might be trying to downsize his own personality cult.
"We believe the change was made at his will to soften his image as a leader of a personality cult, although it is hard to determine what his real intentions are," said Shinya Kato, the editor of Radiopress.
South Korean officials are not yet speculating on the matter, saying the portrait removals "may be for various reasons."
North Korea is one of the few Stalinist states that still exist today, and the political control in the country remains tight.
In recent years North Korea underwent several minor reforms that did not appear to significantly improve quality of life.
It has also remained largely mysterious and secretive to the outside world, as few foreign correspondents are allowed to visit and stay in the country.
BP released their report into the causes of the Deepwater Horizon disaster earlier this year on Wednesday, and shifted much of the blame for the explosion and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, onto , the company managing the rig.
The report concludes by stating that decisions made by "multiple companies and work teams" contributed to the accident which it says arose from "a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces."
The report, the product of a four-month investigation conducted by BP's Head of Safety Operations, Mark Bly, criticizes the oil rig's fire prevention systems, the crew of the rig for failing to realize and act upon evidence that oil was leaking from the surface of the ocean, and describes how BP and Transocean "incorrectly accepted" negative pressure test results.
The document goes on to note that the blow-out preventer failed to operate, likely because critical components were not operational.
Bob Dudley, who will become chief executive of BP, described the accident as "tragic".
He said, "we have said from the beginning that the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon was a shared responsibility among many entities."
"This report makes that conclusion even clearer, presenting a detailed analysis of the facts and recommendations for improvement both for BP and the other parties involved."
"We have accepted all the recommendations and are examining how best to implement them across our drilling operations worldwide."
The report included 25 recommendations, according to a press release, "designed to prevent a recurrence of such an accident."
The oil company has previously blamed Transocean and Halliburton, the well contractor, for the disaster and BP executives feel they have been unfairly blamed by US politicians for the disaster, and the report continues this view.
Tony Hayward, who was fired from the position of BP's chief executive following multiple public relations issues, squarely places the blame for the disaster on Halliburton.
"To put it simply, there was a bad cement job," he said in a statement, also claiming that BP should not be the only company to take the blame for the explosion.
"It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident," he argues.
The report blames the type of cement used by Halliburton, designed to prevent harmful hydrocarbons from reaching the seabed, as well as criticizing the crew of Deepwater Horizon, for failing to realize for forty minutes that oil had started to leak from the well, and once it was realized, the crew "vented" the hydrocarbons "directly onto the rig".
Describing how the explosion, which killed eleven rig personnel, occurred, the report states that "the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system probably transferred a gas-rich mixture into the engine rooms," where the hydrocarbons ignited and a fireball engulfed the rig.
But, the report states, the blowout preventer, the ultimate failsafe on the Deepwater Horizon failed, likely due to the fire on the rig.
An automated system was not operational because the batteries powering it, located in a control pod, had gone flat, and another control pod contained a faulty solenoid valve.
The report was likely, however, written with the company's legal liability for the disaster in a prominent position, since they are facing hundreds of lawsuits and criminal charges as a result of the spill.
The executive summary is four and a half pages long and the first page is made up entirely of legal disclaimers saying if BP was found to be negligent in their operations of the rig, they could be fined a good deal more.
Questions have also been raised as to why BP has chosen to release their report before authorities examine the blowout preventer.
The energy editor of The Guardian, Terry Macalister, wrote that the "catalogue of errors - both human and mechanical" in the report "demolish" the oil industry's "much quoted mantra" of safety first.
"It may come first in the board room but it does not down at the wellhead where the real dangers are faced," he wrote.
"It is worth remembering that BP, its rig operator Transocean and the main well contractor Halliburton are the blue chip companies in the wider oil and gas sector."
"If the shoddy work practices highlighted here are what the best-in-class do, then what is happening in the lower reaches of this industry?"
Transocean described the report as a "self-serving" attempt to "conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident: BP's fatally flawed well design."
"In both its design and construction, BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk - in some cases, severely."
In a statement, the company listed five issues they felt had contributed to the disaster that were no fault but BP's.
"Transocean's investigation is ongoing, and will be concluded when all of the evidence is in, including the critical information the company has requested of BP but has yet to receive."
Members of Congress, who are also carrying out a review into the disaster, also dismissed the report.
Ed Markey, the Massachusetts democrat who has been investigating the spill in Congress, said that he felt the report was simply a lengthy defense of the oil company's handling of the spill.
"BP is happy to slice up blame, as long as they get the smallest piece," he said.
Bly acknowledged during a press conference in Washington that the report did not detail the charges raised against the company in Congress and that BP permitted a culture of recklessness to flourish.
He did, however, reject suggestions that cost-cutting had put lives at risk and the rig was a disaster waiting to happen.
"What we see instead is, where there were errors made they were based on poor decision-making process or using wrong information," he said.
The Guardian reported that "the report is narrowly focused on the final days before the explosion rather than on earlier decisions about well design and safety procedures."
"No BP officials have been sacked for their role in the explosion, and Bly said there was no indication of any blame beyond the well-site managers."
The Associated Press reported that Bly "said at a briefing in Washington that the internal report was a reconstruction of what happened on the rig based on the company's data and interviews with mostly BP employees and was not meant to focus on assigning blame."
"The six-person investigating panel only had access to a few workers from other companies, and samples of the actual cement used in the well were not released."
The report continued, "Steve Yerrid, special counsel on the oil spill for Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, said the report clearly shows the company is attempting to spread blame for the well disaster, foreshadowing what will be a likely legal effort to force Halliburton and Transocean, and perhaps others, to share costs such as paying claims and government penalties."
Head of Greenpeace's energy campaign Jim Footner said that it was "highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP."
However, he said, "the real problem is our addiction to oil, which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk."
"The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now."
"The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy."
Alfred R Sunsen, whose oyster company operating in the Gulf of Mexico is facing the prospect of going out of business after 134 years, reacted angrily the the report.
"The report does not address the people, businesses, animals, or natural resources that have been impacted by the disaster and will be dealing with the consequences of their inadequate and slow response to the disaster," he said.
The New York Times said that the report is "unlikely to carry much weight in influencing the Department of Justice, which is considering criminal and civil charges related to the spill," and described it as "a public relations exercise" and a "probable legal strategy as it prepares to defend itself against possible federal charges, penalties and hundreds of pending lawsuits."
Wayne Pennington, head of the geological engineering department at Michigan Technical University, also alleged that BP was wrong to blame other parties involved with the disaster.
"The blowout and subsequent explosion and spillage appear to the result of an overall attitude that encouraged unwarranted optimism in the quality of each component of the job, allowing the omission of standard testing procedures, and the misinterpretation of other tests in the most-favorable light."
He continued: "Instead, skepticism should reign on any drilling job, and testing and evaluation at each stage of the drilling and completion would then be routine; instead of questioning the need for such things as the cement bond log, the companies involved should insist on checking and double-checking quality at each step of the process."
"This was clearly not done, repeatedly, in the case of the Macondo well, and disaster resulted."
4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, causing damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries.
Extensive measures were used to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline of Louisiana, including skimmer ships, floating containment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades.
Scientists have also reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil not visible at the surface.
The U.S. Government has named BP as the responsible party, and officials have committed to holding the company accountable for all cleanup costs and other damage.
Dudley went on to say that BP "deeply regret" the disaster.
"We have sought throughout to step up to our responsibilities."
"We are determined to learn the lessons for the future and we will be undertaking a broad-scale review to further improve the safety of our operations."
"It will be incumbent on everyone at BP to embrace and implement the changes necessary to ensure that a tragedy like this can never happen again."
Moderate flooding has hit the province of Nakhon Sri Thammarat in southern Thailand.
Moderate to heavy rain persists in the area, further exacerbating the flooding conditions.
The northeast monsoon has intensified the flow of rainfall-laden air from the Gulf of Thailand.
Torrential rains have been plaguing the nine southernmost provinces of the country for nearly two weeks and further downpours are forecast for later this week.
Thung Song District in Nakhon Sri Thammarat province is experiencing waist-high floodwaters in downtown shopping areas.
In Songkhla Province, the government has called for steps to be taken to prevent further flooding of the commercial district of Hat Yai.
Rail tracks have been lifted in some areas to permit flood waters to leave the city, and the Thai Navy has been ordered to take part in relief efforts.
In Muang District of Nakhon Sri Thammarat, many roads have been closed and sandbags are being deployed to help affected businesses.
The Meteorological Department of the Thailand Ministry of Information and Communication Technology issued a weather advisory concerning the flooding, "People in the lower South and navigators in the Gulf of Thailand should exercise caution and small boats should stay from December 15 until December 18."
It is reported that this has left some tourists stranded on smaller resort islands in the Gulf of Thailand.
Across the border in Malaysia, three are reported to have died and over 10,000 been evacuated as a result of the flooding.
The New Zealand Department of Corrections is currently investigating allegations at the Rimutaka prison in Wellington, New Zealand.
The prison guards have allegedly accepted monetary bribes from prisoners in exchange for drugs and cellphones.
Two former officers, Ingrid and Mark Rijniers, have handed over a collection of documents on their encounters while working at Rimutaka prison.
The pair, who were transferred from Holland, claim that Rimutaka prison is run by gang members who dominate the prison guards.
They also claim that if the gang members don't get what they want they will intimidate and threaten the guards with their lives.
However, Ingrid Rijniers is refusing to co-operate with the department because they refused to give her the money to return to Holland.
The New Zealand Corrections Department says it is taking these claims seriously but has not yet found sufficient evidence to back up the claims.
Simon Power, justice and corrections spokesman for the National party, said that the allegations are appalling and reflect heavily on the Corrections Department.
Mr Powers said that Barry Matthews, chief executive of the Department of Corrections, does not know what is happening in his prisons.
"That means the Minister, Damien O'Connor, will be equally clueless."
Twelve percent of 1,043 prisoners who were tested for drugs from the start of this year until June, tested positive for drugs.
Most of the drugs taken was marijuana while fourteen tested positive for "P".
In addition, a teenage prisoner, Liam Ashley, was recently strangled to death in a prison van by a much older adult prisoner.
Mr Power said that with all these new claims emerging, Mr O'Conner should resign as the minister of corrections.
A trio of Canadian trekkers said Friday they completed the fastest unaided on-foot trek using the traditional route from Hercules Inlet on the Ronne Ice Shelf to the South Pole in a record time of 33 days, 23 hours and 30 minutes.
Ottawa ultra-runner Ray Zahab, age 39, adventure journalist and architect Kevin Vallely, age 44, of Lynn Valley, North Vancouver and North Pole expeditionist Richard Weber, age 49, said they completed the 700-mile (1,130-kilometer) journey, at 10,000 feet altitude, finally arriving early Wednesday morning.
They endured a white-out but survived on a 7,000-calorie-a-day diet of pemmican, Gatorade drink powder, outdated salami, deep-fried bacon, cheese and butter.
"If you took a cloud, wrapped it around your head and then duct-taped it, that's what a white-out is like," Mr Zahab, explained.
The trio also suffered altitude sickness, vertigo, massive, painful blisters, and temperatures as low as minus 40.
Zahab had to pull 170-lb (77-kg) sleds of equipment, traveling on foot and on snowshoes while the other two men skied.
According to ExplorersWeb.com's founder, Tom Sjogren, the trio erased the previous record of 39 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes, which was set by American Todd Carmichael, the first American to cross Antarctica to the South Pole alone, on foot and with no assistance.
Guinness World Records spokesman, Damian Field, in London, however, said that "Guinness monitors a category for fastest unsupported trek to the South Pole, but it has no record currently listed."
Prior to Carmichael, the record was held by Briton Hannah McKeand.
In the fastest journey to the South Pole (600 nautical mile journey), she completed solo and in just 39 days, 9 hours and 33 minutes.
In March 2008 she attempted to reach the North Pole alone and unsupported but had to abandon the trip after falling through the ice and badly damaging her shoulder.
Ray Zahab is a Canadian ultramarathon runner, personal trainer, and motivational speaker.
He lives in Chelsea, Quebec, and is famous for his 4,300-mile (6,920-kilometer) epic run across the Sahara Desert in 2007, which was the subject of a documentary narrated by actor Matt Damon's "Running the Sahara."
He heads Impossible2Possible, a nonprofit organization which advocates planet protection.
"I started looking at impossible places on the planet in the past year, and I said Antarctica is one of those impossible places, and if we can create an expedition, perhaps we can inspire a bunch of young people to realize they can achieve," Zahab said.
Richard Weber, M.S.M. (born June 9, 1959 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a world-renowned Canadian Arctic and polar adventurer, from Alcove (near Wakefield).
From 1978 to 2006, he participated in, lead and organized more than 45 Arctic expeditions.
Richard is the only person to have completed six full North Pole expeditions.
He has therefore trekked to the North Pole more than anyone in history.
The trio were waiting out a storm before boarding a flight to Chile for Ottawa.
"I'm pretty tired, actually," said Kevin Vallely, calling from Patriot Hills, Antarctica.
During the saga, Vallely was solely burdened with carrying the high-tech gear in his sled consisting of video cameras, satellite phones, hand-held computers, different kinds of solar panels, batteries and wires chargers.
"Had we not brought all that stuff we probably would have got it done faster because we wouldn't have had to carry all that weight, but then it doesn't matter as much," he explained.
Vallely said he also intends to produce a documentary of the expedition.
Chicago Fire advanced to the Eastern Conference Final after a 3-2 aggregate win against DC United on a pair of goals that were scored within two minutes of each other.
Chicago Fire plays the winner of the New England Revolution/New York Red Bulls 2 Leg affair which is currently tied 0-0.
In what appeared to be a hostage situation ended in tragedy this afternoon in the quiet Massachusetts town of North Reading when the body of a 72-year old man, Roaldas Baran, and his 65-year old wife, Zinaida Girdauskiene, were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide at 14 Country Club Road.
The situation began when a neighbor heard four gunshots and a woman screaming and called 9-1-1.
Police arrived at the home, and encountered the 72-year old man standing over, a brief conversation was held with the man who then went back inside the house.
The SWAT team of the North Eastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council was brought in to clear the house and evacuate the surrounding houses.
Martha Coakley, the District Attorney for Middlesex County reported on what was found upon the SWAT team entering the house.
"In the bedroom, lying, apparently a victim of several gunshot wounds, was a female."
"In the kitchen on the floor, also apparently the victim of a suicide, was a male we know now to be approximately 72-years-old who was her husband."
Emily LaGrassa, Coxley's spokeperson said the man apparently shot the woman and turned the gun on himself.
North Reading Police had been called to the house once before in August 2004.
Mount Redoubt, a volcano in Alaska, erupted on Saturday, sending out clouds of ash thousands of feet high.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport was shut down after ash reached the airport.
Jeremy Lindseth, a spokesman for the airport, said that only small amount of ash reached the airport, but was significant enough to disrupt operations, as ash can cause engine problems for aircraft.
He said that he was uncertain of how many flights were affected due to the eruption.
The eruption happened at around 1:30 PM local time, the United States Geological Survey reported.
The volcano had erupted four times on Friday, billowing ash up to 51,000 feet up into the air.
These are the latest in a series of eruptions from Mount Redoubt, which started on March 22.
The volcano had not erupted since a four-month period in 1989-90.
The Alaska Volcano Observatory set its alert level at red, the highest possible level, meaning that an eruption is imminent, and that it would send a "significant emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere."
The corpse of former Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has been stolen by grave robbers.
Officials report that his body was taken overnight from the Deftera Cemetery in Nicosia.
The theft was reported one day before the anniversary of his death.
Police reported that fresh mounds of dirt were piled up beside the grave.
The leader of the Diko party, Papadopoulos’s former alliance, released a statement.
Marios Garoyan called the act a "heinous and terrible crime".
A heavy smoker, Papadopoulos died on the 12th of December, 2008 after a battle with lung cancer.
He was the President of Cyprus from the 23rd of February, 2003 until 23 February 2008.
The National Hockey League has announced in a press conference earlier this week that it will open the 2008-09 NHL season with two series' in Europe.
On October 4 and October 5, the New York Rangers and Tampa Bay Lightning will play in Prague, Czech Republic at the Sazka Arena, and the Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins will play in Stockholm, Sweden at the Stockholm Globe Arena.
Each of the four teams will also play exhibition games in Europe.
The Rangers will play against Metallurg Magnitogorsk of Russia's elite league in the IIHF-sanctioned Victoria Cup.
The Senators will play against Frolunda of Sweden's elite league.
The Lightning and Penguins will play exhibition games in Germany and Finland respectively.
This will be the second season in a row that the NHL season kicks off with regular season games being played in Europe; at the start of the current 2007-08 season, the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks played games at London's O2 September 28 and September 29.
The man accused of killing a Laval, Quebec police officer on March 2, 2007 was released Tuesday on a CA$200,000 bail.
Basil Parasiris has been charged with several offences stemming from a drug raid carried out by police in the early morning hours of March 2.
Among the alleged offences are a first-degree murder charge in the shooting death of Constable Daniel Tessier, attempted murder in the wounding of Tessier's partner, Stephane Forbes, and several weapons offences.
Parasiris will remain free on bail pending a preliminary hearing to be held in August of this year.
For his part, Parasiris has not denied that the shooting took place, and has apologized to Tessier's family.
He claims that he was acting in self defence, as he didn't know that it was police entering his house in a planned raid, and instead believed intruders had broken in.
My condolences to the Tessier family," Parasiris told CTV News.
"I honestly thought there was a home invasion or something."
The judge overseeing the bail proceedings, ruled that Parasiris would not pose an immediate threat to society, but did place strict conditions on his release.
While awaiting trial, Parasiris, 41, will have to live with his father, obey a curfew, and not travel outside Canada.
In what is believed to be the first ruling of its kind in Canada, releasing on bail a defendant charged with killing a policeman, the judge criticized some of the police tactics used during the raid.
Justice Jean-Guy Boilard of the Quebec Superior Court noted that the police didn't use a "knock notice" before entering Parasiris' house, but rather used a battering ram to break down the door.
When serving a warrant under normal conditions, police are to knock at the door and identify themselves.
Jacques Larochelle, Parasiris' lawyer, indicated that he will contest the warrant's legality.
The prosecution argued that, even if it was not clear to Parasiris that police were entering his home, he should not have been so reckless with a gun.
During the fatal raid on the Parasiris home in March, police collected four loaded handguns, as well as a small amount of drugs and cash.
According to reports, the 357-magnum handgun allegedly used by Parasiris to shoot the officers was legally registered.
Traralgon bounced back after their loss to Morwell with a 73 point victory over Sale in round thirteen of the Gippsland Football League.
The Gippsland League is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.
Traralgon's defence held strong as the team went inside their attacking fifty 63 times to Sales 57.
Sale, however, lead the centre clearances 35 to Traralgon's 27.
The victory moves Traralgon back to second, a game clear of Morwell, who lost to Maffra by 32 points.
French police are holding a 31-year-old who managed to convince social workers and fellow students that he was a 15-year-old Spanish orphan and spent a whole month attending school.
Frederic Bourdin's alias was discovered when a teacher watched a television program about his exploits and his numerous identities.
Claire Chadourne, headmistress at the College Jean-Monnet, said, "He seemed a little older than his classmates, two or three years at the most.
Bourdin, who speaks at least five languages, told social workers and classmates that his name was Francisco Hernandez-Fernandez and that his parents had been killed in a car crash in 2000 and that he'd spent three months in a coma.
He claimed that after being placed into foster care, he was sexually abused and that he escaped to France.
He told his teacher that he had horrible scars that he wished to hide and was given special permission to wear a cap to hide his balding.
In 1997, Bourdin was arrested and imprisoned for six years in the United States for posing a Texas couple's 14-year-old son, who disappeared three years earlier.
He managed to convince the couple that he was their son even though he had brown eyes and a heavy French accent.
Bourdin lived with the couple for three months before a journalist exposed him and his lies were confirmed by a DNA test.
Returning from the United States in 2003, Bourdin showed up in the southeastern Alps, where he claimed to be Leo Balley, who went missing in 1996 when he was seven-years-old and camping with his father.
He says he assumes other identities as a way of receiving the attention he never got as a child.
Following confirmation by Thailand's caretaker cabinet, a proposal to create a 77th province to honour the king's 80th birthday, will be the subject of a feasibility study.
Currently the country consists of 75 provinces, it is expected that the 76th province will be around the Suvarnabhumi International Airport which opens in September 2006.
A United Nations report has shown that sports footwear companies are making progress towards ending the use of sweatshops and are implementing more worker-friendly codes of practice than clothing companies and retailers.
The study, published by the International Labour Organisation, suggests that consumer pressure is behind the changes.
As a result of consumer's concerns, footwear companies have been diverting financial and human resources towards developing and implementing better codes of conduct for suppliers.
Large teams have been established within companies to work toward the goal of better conditions for factory workers.
The study, based upon interviews with hundreds of managers, activists, government officials, factory workers and worker representatives and visits to companies all over the world, goes on to suggest that workers should be given more powers to oversee conditions in their places of work.
Clothing companies have been failing to make such good progress due the large number of constantly-changing suppliers they use, with the ILO study describing progress as "spotty."
A major retailer may have a supply base of over 5,000 different companies, making it more difficult to establish stronger, more effective links with supply companies.
They have also assigned less manpower to the task of compliance with codes of practice.
In some areas of the retail industry, there has been almost no compliance with codes of practice.
A 54-year-old German farmer who lost both arms in a farming accident six years ago has become the first patient to receive a complete double arm transplant.
In a press statement released by the clinic, it was revealed that the patient had been thoroughly physically checked and had psychological counselling prior to the surgery to ensure he was mentally stable enough to cope with the procedure.
Since completion of the surgery, the patient has been on immuno-suppressant drugs to prevent rejection of the new limbs.
Indications from the clinic suggest that the double attachment went well, although it could be up to 2 full years before the patient is able to move the arms.
The donor arms came from an unnamed teenager, who is believed to have died in a car accident.
A retired Canadian military major, Michel Pilon, saw the man and two of his friends urinate on the memorial at about 11 p.m. Saturday.
The man was photographed urinating on the National War Memorial in Ottawa.
The 23-year-old was pictured smiling and making a hand gesture toward the camera.
Ottawa police are looking for the 23-year-old Montreal man and his two friends, both under the age of 18.
"This is a shrine to people who fought for us in the wars."
They could be charged with public urination or behaving in an offensive manner, and fined $125 or required to do a day of community work.
Finnish theatrical hard rock band Lordi have released Beast Loose in Paradise - which will be the soundtrack to the band's upcoming horror movie Dark Floors - as a downloadable single.
The song was originally intended to be released via Zed.fi, but for unknown reasons has not appeared on the site.
However, it has appeared on at least two other sites as a pay-to-download single - MSN Music Finland and MTV3.fi.
The song was one of two recorded last month, and will be released by Sony BMG Finland as an actual CD on January 8 .
The other song, titled Studs and Leather, was also written for the movie.
The cover art for the CD single has already been revealed.
It is a direct tribute to the KISS album Creatures of the Night.
Most of both songs were composed during Lordi's tour of the United States as part of Ozzfest, with the band's lead vocalist saying in an interview with MonsterDiscoHell.com that the main riff of Beast Loose in Paradise was written in Milwaukee, while the chorus of Studs and Leather was composed in St. Augustine.
He went on to say that Studs and Leather had originally been intended for Bend over and Pray the Lord!, an unreleased album from 1999 that had been intended to be Lordi's debut.
The verses from Beast Loose in Paradise had been decided on between the whole band during therapy sessions at Christmas 2006.
He said that he had written most of the rest between two US tours, the Ozzfest tour and a tour as the support act for American gothic doom metal band Type O Negative.
He continued to deny a recent rumour posted in Finnish music periodical Soundi that the new material was going to be "more brutal and raw" than that on Lordi's last album, The Arockalypse.
"Our music is not gonna get any brutal or heavier, but not any lighter [either]..."
Although Beast Loose in Paradise is more 'movie-esque' and 'horror-ish' on purpose.
And some might say it's even heavier, but at the very least the chorus will be familiar and melodic Lordi stuff.
And Studs and Leather is basically Heaven's on Fire (KISS song) meets Balls To The Wall (Accept song).
United States President George Bush has arrived in Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to attempt to encourage support for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and U.S.-led efforts to contain Iran.
Mr. Bush is using this tour of the Middle East to ask Arab allies of the USA to provide diplomatic and financial backing to Palestinian leaders involved in negotiations with Israel.
In a speech on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the president also urged Gulf states to join Washington in confronting Iran, which he called "the world's leading state sponsor of terror."
Sunni Arab Gulf states have maintained relations with Iran despite their concerns about the Shi'ite country's regional influence.
Mr. Bush's talks with Saudi leaders also are expected to cover arms sales.
Before heading to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Bush visited Dubai briefly.
He told a round table of young Arab leaders there that America respects their religion and wants to work together in peace.
Sunday, in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Bush accused Iran of sending arms or financial support to militants in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.
Iran denies such allegations and accuses Washington of trying to spread anti-Iranian sentiment in the region.
According to many reporters George Bush has kept a strong relationship with the Saudi royal family, who are often considered as allies of the United States.
President Bush is due to leave Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for Egypt, the final stop on his Mideast tour before his return to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.
A huge wildfire that has been burning in the High Desert of Southern California since 2:00 pm (2200 UTC) yesterday continues to threaten residents in the city of Palmdale in the Antelope Valley region of the Los Angeles County this afternoon.
Mandatory evacuation orders have been set in place, affecting 2,000 homes.
The fire is one of three that ignited yesterday in the Mojave Desert and San Gabriel Mountains.
The first was a 30-acre fire that began to the west of Lancaster in the Fairmont area.
It was contained and suppressed by mid-afternoon, but the other two fires ignited while firefighters were battling the first.
The second fire, the "Briggs Fire", began shortly after 2:00 pm near 8334 Soledad Canyon Road and Briggs Road, south of the freeway.
It burned 500 acres south of the 14 Freeway, but the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) now has it contained, and firefighters are hopeful that it will burn itself out as it edges closer to the 160,577-acre burn area of last year's Station Fire.
The third fire, the "Crown Fire", broke out at around the same time as the Briggs Fire on the northern side of the 14 Freeway near Acton.
The Crown fire has so far burned 13,000 acres and has been heading north into Leona Valley and Palmdale.
Over 800 firefighters are now tackling the Crown Fire on the ground, Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fixed-wing aircraft have taken to the skies to drop Phos-Chek slurry (a red powdery fire retardant that is a mixture of mostly water and fertilizer, and doesn't evaporate) on the fire, and modified Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters known as "Firehawks" are making water-drops.
As well as LACFD, firefighters from Los Angeles City Fire Department, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) are also helping to battle the fire.
Weather conditions and topography have hindered their efforts, as temperatures rose to 98 degrees Fahrenheit today, with windspeeds of 25mph.
Tonight, the National Weather Service predicts winds will reach as high as 50mph.
The fire burned down a Los Angeles County Sheriff Department communications tower, forcing Lancaster and Palmdale-based deputies to set up mobile operations bases and coordinate their efforts using cell phones and computers.
Last night, the California Aqueduct acted as a barrier to the fire.
Residents of Leona Valley, Lake Elizabeth, Ritter Ranch, Rancho Vista, Ana Verde and Palmdale received Reverse 911 telephone calls last night alerting them of mandatory evacuations.
Many of the evacuation orders were lifted this morning as the spread of the fire decreased.
However, as winds picked up in the afternoon, fire embers were carried across the aqueduct and the fire is now heading towards a highly-populated area of Palmdale.
Residents who were allowed back into their homes were re-evacuated to Red Cross shelters set up in local schools and parks.
The fire is also threatening five high-voltage power lines that supply electricity to much of Southern California.
21 customers in the immediate vicinity have been without power since yesterday.
At 5:00 pm, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, police and fire officials held a press conference.
The governor said that the fire was 20% contained and had burned 13,000 acres.
It is thought that the fire began when workers in Agua Dulce caused sparks by hammering the bolts when they were removing a tire from a rim.
U.S. security officials have cleared a Delta Airlines passenger jet diverted to New Mexico to take off again because "no suspicious items" had been found.
The aircraft was reportedly initially diverted after the crew found a note with the word "bomb" written on it in the lavatory, but security officials have declined to comment on the nature of the "potential security threat".
Delta Airlines 1706—a domestic U.S. flight between Detroit and San Diego—diverted to Albuquerque International Sunport in Albuquerque, where the Boeing 737-800 aircraft was taken to a remote area of the airport.
Passengers were interviewed by FBI agents, and dogs searched all the luggage on board.
No one has yet been arrested, but the note has been determined to be hoax.
One passenger said the captain spoke over the intercom, saying: "We're getting ready to divert."
"It's probably a hoax, but we've got to take this very seriously."
After being cleared of any threat, the aircraft was expected to continue to San Diego.
Ed Miliband — the current leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition in the United Kingdom — and Justine Thornton, his long-term partner, have announced that they are now engaged to each other.
They are anticipated to marry in Nottingham, England on May 27.
The couple, who have been in a relationship for five years, currently have two children — Daniel, aged twenty-one months, and Samuel, who was born in November 2010.
Until now, they had been "too busy" to perform the act of marriage, due to various occurrences; according to The Daily Telegraph, this includes Ed's work in the 2010 UK general election, the birth of their son Daniel, and Ed's appearance at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference.
41-year-old Miliband proposed to 40-year-old Thornton at Primrose Hill, a short distance from their residence in the northern area of London, in 2010.
Marion Miliband, the mother of Ed, was the first individual to be notified of this news.
David Miliband, his brother and a fellow UK politician, was "the person I told after my mother", Ed stated; he "is delighted for me and he will obviously be there".
According to Miliband, of all the guests at the wedding, "family and close friends" will be amongst the approximately fifty individuals receiving invitations to "something that has been on our minds for some time", describing the upcoming day as "fun".
He has stated there will be no best man present at the ceremony, contrary to speculation that the role would be given to David.
After the wedding, Ed and Justine are intending to have a honeymoon in a secret location.
Miliband was asked if he thought it was important to be married in case he becomes the next prime minister.
He replied: "I think people are pretty relaxed about this."
"I don't think people care one way or the other about what other people do in their lives as long as they show responsibility to each other."
Internet users on the Chinese-forums.com website report that the longtime block of Wikipedia by China has been at least temporarily lifted.
Absent an announcement from the Chinese government, it's unclear what the conditions were that caused the site to be accessible from within China.
A blog by Wikipedia contributor Andrew Lih says that someone in "Beijing emailed me saying he could suddenly start using Wikipedia again.
He continued that "from a Beijing China Netcom's residential DSL connection, the English language and other foreign language versions are now accessible, but the Chinese version is still blocked", noting that the Chinese-language version is the most important one to most Wikipedians in the country.
The blog entry goes on to explain the finer points of China's blocking system, which is more complex than most media outlets suggest.
Wikimedia head Jimmy Wales told Moneycontrol.com yesterday that, "We don't know what they took offense to."
"We really don't intend to compromise the way Google did."
"I am trying to set up high-level meetings in China to state our case and explain why we should be unblocked."
"We have no idea what the result of that would be."
"Wikipedia is not a haven for dissidents but an encyclopedia."
"About 99.9 percent of Wikipedia has topics that are not of interest to the Chinese Government."
He also told the outlet, he stressed how such bans were blocking Chinese perspectives in the global media.
The third block of Wikipedia, which was implemented 19 October 2005, was issued without explanation or an expected length.
Wikipedia has been blocked twice before, the first from 2-21 June 2004, due to the 15th anniversary of the Tian'anmen Square Incident.
A website called baidu.com runs a self-censored wiki-based encyclopedia website, called baidubaike.com, launched in April of this year.
Wikipedia is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organisation based out of St. Petersberg, Florida.
Its 2007 annual convention, Wikimania, is set to take place in Taipei.
Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in the allied invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraqi oil production figures have been bleak.
However, new signs are being revealed that Iraqi oil output is at its best since the fall of Hussein.
The Iraqi oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, stated that about 2.5 million barrels of oil are now produced per day, a figure that has seen a rise lately.
During the invasion of Iraq, lead by the United States, oil output was at about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) and before the invasion oil production ranged from 3 million to, at its peak, 3.5 million bpd.
According to the head of Kenyan seafarer's program, Somali pirates have hijacked another vessel from the United States.
An American-owned tugboat from Italy along with its 16 member crew was hijacked around 11 am EST on Saturday in the Gulf of Aden.
The Italian Ambassador, Pierandrea Magistrati, confirmed that "there is a boat that has been hijacked, I believe by Somali pirates."
Additionally, Shona Lowe, a spokeswoman at NATO's Northwood maritime command center reported that the Italian-flagged tugboat was hijacked this morning off of Somalia's northern coast.
Lowe also confirmed that Italian government officials along with the company that owned the tugboat were trying to secure the release of the crew, ten of which were Italians.
Andrew Mwangura, the head of the East African Seafarers' Assistance Program, said that maritime industry sources also reported that the U.S. tugboat was towing two barges at the time it was attacked.
The contents of those barges is not known at this time.
Meanwhile, U.S. Captain Richard Phillips of the U.S. Maersk Alabama is still being held hostage, for a fourth day, by four other Somali pirates.
Phillips, who voluntarily surrendered himself to the pirates in order to protect his crew, is being held in a lifeboat despite an attempt to escape.
The fourth day of New York Fashion Week debuted few daring designs even from designers known for such work.
With few exceptions, the overwhelming theme was "old is new" and that the '70s were even more in fashion than the shows on Sunday suggested.
Among the designers to unveil their Fall 2008 lines on Monday were Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera, Betsey Johnson, Proenza Schouler and a rejuvenated Halston line, under the direction of designer Marco Zanini.
Both global warming and the slowing economy have been cited as reasons for the overwhelming use of lighter fabrics over heavier attire.
Also, retro designs and continuing trends have been used in effort to save money, like the tights that were expected to go out of fashion this year.
Even in the glamorous world of high-end fashion, money has been tight, and with the world economies in a collective downturn, major designers have been more wary of continuing to churn out the stream of couture designs that past Fashion Weeks have seen.
The lone daring designer for the day was Carolina Herrera, who discarded the furs she promoted in the Fall 2007 show to focus on a Peter Pan theme, with earth tones and bird feathers.
To further the "flying Peter Pan" motif, models donned such designs as a chiffon dress with ostrich feathers and a taffeta gown with a feather waistband.
Oscar de la Renta opted for more traditional blacks, golds and grays, debuting lines for men and women in fabrics he is familiar with.
Men were outfitted in tweed while women were fitted in dresses that experimented with embroidery and tulle, both shades of past collections.
Among others, labels Badgley Mischka, Diesel, and Vivienne Tam unveil their newest collections on Tuesday.
The Icelandic internet bank, Icesave, has suspended all 300,000 of its UK customer accounts, leaving account holders in the United Kingdom unable to withdraw or deposit any funds.
"We are not currently processing any deposits or any withdrawal requests through our Icesave internet accounts."
"We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our customers."
The internet bank, owned by the Icelandic bank, Landsbanki (Landsbankinn), which was recently nationalised in an attempt to rescue it, has been hit by the global financial crisis.
Reports from the United Kingdom suggest that the traders and city are preparing for the parent company to be declared insolvent, leaving customers to recover their monies through a financial compensation scheme being backed by the Icelandic Government.
The plan will cover the first € 20,887 (Approx £16,300 / $28,720), the remainder of the customers funds being recovered through the UK's own financial compensation system.
Following the decision to nationalise Landsbanki, the Icelandic Prime Minister, Geir Haarde, who introduced and signed the emergency legislation into law, stated:"What we are doing here is saving a banking system - saving the domestic banking system - and making sure that it can function properly."
In describing and explaining its actions in nationalising the bank, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority issued this brief statement:
In response to the deepening world financial situation, the Dutch government has this afternoon increased its savers protection from €38,000 to €80,000 effective immediately, to help secure the financial status of its savers within Holland.
Icesave also has a Dutch branch, icesave.nl - their website was unreachable at the time of this article.
On January 25, 2005, Don Brash, the leader of the New Zealand National Party made a speech to the Orewa Rotary Club where he focussed upon welfare dependency.
He pledged to reduce the number of working-age beneficiaries from the current figure of 300 000 to 200 000 over ten years.
His particular target was the 109 000 solo parents on the Domestic Purposes Benefit (DPB).
Brash suggested a greater role for adoption in reducing this number, and also hinted that mothers who did not name the father, or who had another child while already on the DPB, may be penalised.
Brash's advocacy of adopting children out has lead to a number of attacks, Prime Minister Helen Clark responded by saying "I think we need to support people to keep their babies".
A package of six media reform bills introduced last week before Australia's Parliament — including one proposing appointing a Public Interest Media Advocate (PIMA) to monitor print and online sectors — was shelved yesterday by the Australian Labor Party, with only two passed before a seven week break for the country's legislative body.
Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, had hoped to see the legislation package passed by the end of the week.
The Parliament of Australia summarized Public Interest Media Advocate Bill 2013 as, "Part of a package of six bills in relation to the media sector, the bill: creates the independent statutory office of the Public Interest Media Advocate (PIMA); provides for the functions, appointment, and terms and conditions of PIMA; and requires an annual report to be prepared on PIMA’s activities and other specified matters."
Other bills in the package delineate what PIMA's role would be.
Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Convergence Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013 and Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2013 both had their second reading on Tuesday in the House and were the only bills to pass both houses of parliament.
Unlike the other bills in the package which have not had a third reading before being shelved, the former bill deals primarily with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Special Broadcasting Service, while the latter bill increased licensing fees for television stations.
On Monday, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) released a statement saying such government oversight is not required.
Australia's The Daily Telegraph is quoted by the Brisbane Times describing this legislation as an "aggressive attempt to silence your media."
Speaking before a Senate committee about media reform, AAP chief Bruce Davidson said, "We simply do not believe that there is a problem with the conduct of the media in Australia, and certainly not that of AAP, that warrants further oversight by a minister-appointed body [...]"
"Any hidden perception, I believe, of government interference is simply a dangerous precedent that may lead to control, may lead to interference [...]"
"The aims may be noble, Mr Chairman, but the potential for potential misuse and changes of that legislation as presented to us, I think, is a dangerous thing to contemplate."
Former federal court judge Ray Finkelstein oversaw an inquiry into the Australian print media in 2011.
He told a government inquiry, "There are no powerful groups in society that can come along to governments or anybody and say 'we can do what we like when we like and there's nothing you should do about it'."
Finkelstein is also on the record as stating that self regulation by the industry through their own organization has failed.
5,580 Hong Kong citizens participated in a umbrella unfurling campaign, which was organized by the pan-democrats in order to support having full universal suffrage in 2012.
The participants gathered in Victoria Park and unfurled yellow umbrellas forming the numbers 2012 against a background of blue umbrellas.
The organizers had prepared 10,080 umbrellas, 3,144 in yellow and 6,936 in blue.
However, since the event was not as popular as expected, about four thousand blue ones were left undistributed.
Nevertheless, Ronny Tong, an organizer from Civic Party, said he was satisfied with the turnout.
Anson Chan, the former Chief Secretary and one of the candidates of the upcoming by-election in the Legislative Council, also participated in this event.
Currently, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is elected by a election committee of 800 people, and most of them heavily favour PRC government.
Also, only half of the seats in Legislative Council is directly elected, and another half is elected by less than 5% of citizens.
Therefore, the pan-democrats in Hong Kong demand to have universal suffrage in the next elections in 2012.
US professional wrestler and former World Wrestling Entertainment star Lance Cade has been found dead at the age of 29.
The cause of death was announced by Cade’s father as apparent heart failure.
Cade, whose real name is Lance McNaught was trained by former world champion Shawn Michaels and made his professional debut in 1999.
After working in Japan, Cade signed with World Wrestling Entertainment, the largest wrestling promotion in the United States.
In 2003 Cade made his first appearance on television and teamed with Mark Jindrak.
After one year the team split and Cade was tagged with another wrestler.
With Trevor Murdoch, Cade won the World Tag Team Championship three times in as many years.
After five years in the company Cade was released from his contract in October 2008.
He was later re-hired in 2009 but again released the next year.
World Wrestling Entertainment released a statement on the death Cade through its website.
It read “World Wrestling Entertainment was informed Friday morning by Lance McNaught’s father that he has passed away of apparent heart failure.
Former Tag Team Champion Matt Hardy and WWE legend Mick Foley paid tributes to Cade.
A Palestinian teenager was killed and seven others, including six children, injured in an Israeli airstrike near a school in the town of Beit Lahiya, according to Dr. Muawiya Hassanin, a local emergency services official.
Israeli military officials said that the strike targeted militants who were retrieving a device used to fire missiles.
Israel's incursions into northern Gaza, which are aimed at curbing rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, have killed over 50 people over the last six days.
Friday saw 17 killings, including the gunning down of two women outside a mosque in Beit Hanoun.
At least seven people, including a 12-year-old girl were killed by Israeli action on Saturday, and three others yesterday.
The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert denied that his country was planning to re-occupy Gaza, and said that the offensive is aimed at stopping rockets from being fired into Israel by Hamas militants.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has termed the incidents "massacres" and has called for the UN Security Council to discuss the issue.
Israeli troops have regularly made incursions into Gaza following the capture of Gilad Shalit in June this year.
There are at least two big winners in Tuesday night's US$370 million Mega Millions lottery drawing which is held in 12 U.S. states.
The two winning tickets were sold in Georgia and New Jersey, but lottery officials say that no one has come forward to claim their millions.
One ticket was sold at a store called Campark Liquors, which is located in Woodbine, New Jersey.
The other ticket was sold at what is called the Favorite Market, located in Dalton, Georgia.
The drawing, the biggest in Mega Millions history, was moved from its usual location in Atlanta, Georgia to Times Square, New York because at one point, according to New York's lottery commissioner, Robert McLaughlin, at least 1,000,000 tickets an hour were being sold in the state of New York.
In fact, the state's lottery system, for reasons still not known, went off-line at 10:25 p.m., just over a half hour before the drawing was to be held.
At least one person was one number away from winning the jackpot, matching five of the six numbers.
That ticket is worth $250,000 and was bought at Burtonsville Crown Beer & Wine in Montgomery County, Maryland.
The previous record for the highest multi-state lottery was set back in 2006 when the Power Ball jackpot paid out at least $365 million dollars to eight people in Nebraska.
Another multi-state lottery, The Big Game (which was later named Mega Millions) has the third highest jackpot of $363 million dollars which was paid out in 2000.
An Austrian man is in jail after authorities say he used a flamethrower to burn his two elderly in-law parents to death as they slept in their home located in Hartberg in the state of Styria.
The man, 48, is said to have first doused the bedroom with gasoline and then used a canister filled with propane to light the room on fire.
The suspect left the scene of the crime, but was apprehended by police shortly after the incident.
In the process, the man stabbed himself in the stomach in an apparent suicide attempt.
He is currently in a drug induced coma at a local hospital.
The government of Saudi Arabia removed an eleven-year ban on livestock imports from Somalia after fears of Rift Valley Fever were allayed, senior Somali officials said on Thursday.
The decision was well received across Somalia, as hundreds of thousands of farmers heavily rely on animal exports to the oil-rich Middle East.
Under the new arrangement, Saudi officials will closely examine animals before they are shipped off to Saudi soil.
"This is a tremendous decision for Somalis across the Horn of Africa," said Idiris Ibrahim Abdi, the livestock minister of Somaliland, the self-declared republic in northern Somalia, which has developed one of the most sophisticated animal processing plants in its port town of Berbera.
According to news accounts, the Saudi agricultural ministry said the decision is based on years of cross-examination and monitoring of animal farms in Somalia.
Animal trade is one of the few surviving economic engines of Somalia's largely destroyed economy.
Business leaders and animal farmers have largely welcomed the Saudi decision.
Astronomers have discovered an extrasolar planet that may eventually collide into its sun.
The planet, called WASP-18b, orbits its star in under one day, and is 10 times larger than Jupiter.
The planet's name is derived from the group that discovered it, WASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets).
Tidal interactions between the planet and its star are pulling them together, and it will likely crash into its star in under one million years.
The planet is relatively much closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun.
Earth is a distance of 93 million miles from the sun, whereas WASP-18b is only 1.4 million miles from its star.
Professor Andrew Collier Cameron of St. Andrew's University commented on the inherent problems with the planet: "The problem with this planet is that it's very massive and very close to its star."
"It should be creating tidal bulging that makes it spiral into its star."
Coel Hellier of Keele University led a group of researchers that discovered the planet.
Their study of WASP-18b was published in the August 27 issue of the journal Nature.
Scientists had a 1 in 2,000 chance of discovering the planet.
There are 300 planets which are known to orbit stars other than the Sun.
An exchange of handshakes at a Latin American summit Friday marked the end of the bitter dispute that had taken place between the nations of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela over the past week.
The presidents of each country agreed to end the conflict, and said political ties would be reinstated.
"With the commitment of never attacking a brother country again and by asking forgiveness, we can consider this very serious incident resolved," said Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa, as the other Latin American leaders applauded.
The dispute was over Colombia's air strike against FARC rebels, which Ecuador accused of entering their territory.
As a result, Ecuador and their ally Venezuela had sent troops to their borders and severed ties with Colombia.
At the summit, Uribe charged Correa's government of having links with the FARC rebels, a charge that Correa quickly denied.
He admitted there had been communication with the FARC, but only regarding the release of hostages held by the rebels, including French-Colombian politician Íngrid Betancourt.
Uribe insisted that Ecuador has not done enough to fight the rebels, which was the reason the operation had to remain a secret, he said.
"We have not gotten cooperation from President Correa in the fight against terrorism."
Correa then advocated the creation of an international peacekeeping force to control the border, saying that Ecuador has become a victim of the fighting in Colombia.
Finally, it was Dominican president Leonel Fernandez plea for peace that ended the feud.
He requested that the presidents shake hands with each other, which they did, in a televised gesture viewed live across Latin America.
Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, also agreed to reinstate diplomatic ties with Colombia after shaking hands with their president.
The leaders at the summit later approved a declaration in which Uribe apologized for the military operation and vowed never again to violate another nation's sovereignty.
It also mentioned a commitment to fight against threats posed by "irregular or criminal groups."
The Ulster Defense Association (UDA), a paramilitary group in Northern Ireland that wants Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom, said today that it has rid itself of its weapons.
A statement by the group read, "The Ulster Defense Association was formed to defend our communities."
"We state quite clearly and categorically that this responsibility now rests with the government and its institutions where legitimacy resides."
UDA spokesperson Frankie Gallagher spoke at a press conference in Belfast, stating that the group regrets the approximately 400 people, primarily Catholic civilians, that they were responsible for the murder of between 1971 and 2001.
He added, "But we are determined and are willing to play our full part in ensuring that tragedy of the last 40 years will never happen again."
The destruction of ammunition and explosives was verified by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, stating that other groups have a deadline of February 9 to destroy arms they may still hold, after which they may potentially face imprisonment.
Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister, Micheál Martin, said in a statement, "This is a statement of confidence in the political process and in the devolved institutions."
Irish President Mary McAleese said the group's choice was "a very positive milestone on the journey of peace."
The other main "loyalist" groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Red Hand Commandos (RHC), are reported to have destroyed their arms last June, with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) having destroyed their arms four years ago.
However, two republican splinter groups, the Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) and the Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA), have refused to lay down their arms and have continued to undertake attacks including three murders in March of 2009.
The Real IRA attacked the Massereene Barracks in Antrim, County Antrim on March 7 and killed two British soliders.
Three days later, The Continuity IRA claimed responsibility for the murder of Police Service of Northern Ireland officer Stephen Carroll, who was shot by a sniper responding to a call.
There is also concern that the power-sharing government between Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party may collapse because of disagreements between the parties on the issue of transferring policing and justice powers from London.
A second day of winter weather and snow has caused further disruption in the UK.
At 15:13 GMT last Saturday, one Wikinews contributor in West Lothian described the conditions there as 'white-out', although later conditions were reported to have improved.
Forecasters had indicated further snow in Scotland later into Saturday evening, with some higher ground experiencing as much as 15 centimetres into Sunday.
Heavy snow for parts of Northern England had also been forecast.
In South of England the wintry weather has also affected cross channel services, with Operation Stack being brought into effect due to issues at the Port of Calais.
Eurostar and Channel tunnel services were also disrupted for an extended period, when trains broke down temporarily stranding at least 2000 passengers according to both BBC and Guardian reports.
The cause is still under investigation, but it has been suggested, temperatures changes on entering the Channel tunnel may have been responsible.
In addition to transport disruption, a number of sports have been affected.
At least twenty football fixtures across the UK have been postponed, with some rugby matches also affected.
Race meetings at Haydock, Newcastle were cancelled due to the conditions, a planned meet at Ascot having been abandoned earlier.
A National Hunt meeting at Carlisle yesterday was also abandoned.
An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) spokesman in Washington revealed Wednesday it had documented and reported to the United States credible information concerning desecration of the Koran by Guantanamo Bay personnel between January 2002 and January 2003.
The ICRC rarely discloses publicly the contents of the confidential reports it gives to governments.
Simon Schorno, Red Cross spokesman, said the ICRC's concerns were mentioned multiple times to Pentagon officials in their reports.
ICRC delegates have had access to Guantanamo Bay detainees since 2002 and have compiled and corroborated independent reports from detainees about desecration of the Koran numerous times to Guantanamo Bay commanders and Pentagon officials, said Mr. Schorno.
The ICRC representatives never observed any such incidents themselves, however.
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman, acknowledged that allegations were made on "rare occasions" but were uncorroborated.
Mr. Schorno disputed the Pentagon's denial saying, "All information we received were corroborated allegations."
He added that, "We certainly corroborated mentions of the events by detainees themselves," and that "the ICRC considers such reports very seriously, and very carefully, and [we] document everything."
The reports ceased after January 19, 2003, when the Defense Department issued three pages of guidelines on proper treatment of Korans, according to Mr. Schorno.
On Wednesday Mr. Schorno gave credit for addressing the issue, saying, "We brought it up to the attention of the authorities, and it was followed through."
Some Muslim news agencies are still reacting to last week's Newsweek article alleging Korans had been thrown into Guantanamo Bay toilets.
The Jordanian newspaper Al-Dustur reported that some Middle Eastern TV stations were broadcasting images of Korans shredded by US forces in one Iraqi mosque.
New York-based Human Rights Watch special counsel Reed Brody said Wednesday that the White House's response to Newsweek's report of the desecrations should be fully investigated and that "those who ordered or condoned this abuse, [should] not attack those who have tried to report on it."
However, Scott McClellan explained in a press conference last Tuesday that the White House is not trying to tell Newsweek what to print.
McClellan said, "Look, this report caused serious damage to the image of the United States abroad."
"We appreciate the step that they took by retracting the story."
"Now we would encourage them to move forward and do all that they can to help repair the damage that has been done by this report."
"But, no, you're absolutely right, it's not my position to get into telling people what they can and cannot report."
The Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) notified the public, through a news release Wednesday, that a recent high volume of patients has put a strain on the hospital's resources.
The MHI requested that the public avoid its emergency department and find alternate care, if possible.
It did indicate that acute care emergency patients would not be turned away.
The notice was to be in place for 24 hours from Wednesday.
On Thursday, the MHI issued a extension to the public notice for an additional 24-hour period.
The number of patients that visited the MHI over the past few months had been abnormally high and reached a peak in the past two weeks, according to the head of emergency services.
Alain Vadeboncoeur indicated that it was unusual for the MHI to put out such an advisory, but assured the public that the hospital would "always take the big emergencies."
The hospital treats 45 to 50 emergency patients per day, typically, but that number jumped to as many as 70 patients per day in the past two weeks.
The MHI maintains 153 beds, including 42 in medical intensive care and 29 in surgical intensive care and performs 1,850 cardiac surgeries yearly.
It was suggested by the MHI that people requiring non-emergency care contact their regional Info-Santé for telephone-based advice, or visit a local clinic.
Founded in 1954, the MHI specializes in cardiovascular treatment, with an emphasis on prevention, specialized care, research, and assessment of new technologies.
The MHI is a teaching facility affiliated with the University of Montreal.
A Polish soldier was killed yesterday by a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan.
Kazimierz Kasprzak was killed in the province of Ghazni when a roadside bomb exploded underneath the patrol vehicle in which he was travelling.
His death was announced by the Polish Defence Ministry and Lt. Sebastian Kostecki, a spokesman for the Polish military.
Kasprzak was airlifted to a military base after the explosion but died during surgery.
With his death the toll of Polish forces killed in Afghanistan has risen to 21.
Polish forces joined NATO in their fight with the Taliban in March 2002.
President of Poland Bronislaw Komorowski has said he has planned to pull Polish troops out of Afghanistan by 2012.
Many Polish citizens favor pulling troops out of the war zone.
The Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-il, has died according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
The cause of death was "advanced acute myocardial infarction, complicated by serious heart shock," commonly known as a heart attack.
Kim apparently died two days earlier on December 17 aboard a train.
However, other records from the former Soviet Union place his age at 70.
At the same time, Kim's son, Kim Jong-un has been named as the "Great Successor" by North Korean state media.
Citizens are being told they "must faithfully revere respectable comrade Kim Jong-un."
"At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong-un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome today's difficulties," according to KCNA.
According to Yonhap News Agency, South Korea's military is on "emergency alert" following a meeting by South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).
According to a JCS official, "We're keeping close tabs on the demilitarized zone (DMZ), Joint Security Area (JSA) and Northern Limit Line (NLL) for possibilities of North Korean provocations."
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak also presided over a meeting.
A statement from Lee's office said, "The government will remain thoroughly prepared while keeping a close watch over the situation in North Korea."
"The government will also cooperate closely with the international community to maintain peace and safety on the Korean Peninsula."
Thoroughbred horse racing has been cancelled indefinitely in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland due to an outbreak of Equine Influenza.
An Australia-wide ban on the movement of horses, donkeys and mules which was due to expire on Wednesday has been extended until Friday.
So far the virus only appears to have infected horses in NSW and Queensland, with 51 confirmed cases and another 400 suspected.
So far all those infected appear to be horses used for recreational purposes and not thoroughbred race horses.
Despite the bans on racing and horse movements, track work will recommence in NSW and Queensland today.
It had been feared yesterday that four race horses at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney had been struck down by the virus, but the horses later tested negative to the virus.
If an outbreak were to occur at Randwick it could affect up to 700 race horses stabled there.
The outbreak comes at a bad time for the industry, as it prepares for the lucrative spring racing season in Sydney and Melbourne.
The AUD$1 million Golden Rose event at Rosehill has been cancelled, although it is expected that Melbourne's spring racing carnival will resume on Saturday as no cases of the flu have been seen in Victoria.
Racing Victoria has also said the Melbourne Cup will go ahead as planned despite the outbreak, even if no interstate or international horses can attend.
Despite fines of up to $44,000 and 12 months imprisonment in NSW there have been reports that more than 100 horse owners have been caught moving their horses.
The NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald, said it was "absolutely vital that no-one moves a horse in this state".
"We will be working with police to ensure horses are at a standstill," he said.
The racing bans have cost gaming companies Tabcorp and Tattersall's millions, with Tabcorp losing $65 million in revenue on the weekend.
Tabcorp expects to lose around $150 million in turnover this week.
Tattersall's has also said it expects to lose around $2 million in revenue per week due to the outbreak.
Investors reacted to the news, slashing 3 percent of the price of Tattersall's shares and over 4 percent of those of Tabcorp.
Around twelve people were killed in Iraq today while they were playing football on a makeshift pitch in a predominantly Shi'a area in west Baghdad.
According to police, two bombs, which had been planted in the middle of the pitch, were detonated.
Earlier today, Iraq’s President revealed Iraqi troops would take over safekeeping of the entire country from American troops by the end of 2006.
He said the takeover would occur gradually but would be complete by the start of 2007.
Yesterday, more than fifty people were killed across the country.
After he had repeated this publicly, he was arrested and charged with apostasy.
Iranian authorities later claimed he was jailed for spying for Israel, but this was contradicted by the court documents.
They say they hold the Iranian authorities responsible for his death and his only crime was belief in his religion.
Villagers near the town of Goroka in the jungle-covered highlands about 400 kilometres north of the capital Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea killed four women they believed to be witches.
They tortured the women by stabbing them with hot rods so they would confess to causing a road crash using sorcery.
The accident had resulted in the death of three prison guards.
With the help of some village elders, police have now discovered these murders which occurred in October of last year.
BBC News reports human rights campaigners saying that it is not uncommon in Papua New Guinea for women suspected of engaging in black magic to be killed, often by hanging or burning.
Republicans and lobbyists close to President George W. Bush have reported that the White House will propose changing the formula for establishing initial Social Security benefit levels in order to cut guaranteed expenditures on future retirees, according to today's Washington Post.
The Social Security Administration would no longer use the increase in wages over a worker’s lifetime to calculate retirees’ first-year benefits but would use inflation rates instead.
The new “price indexing” formula will reduce individual benefits and overall Social Security outlays because the inflation rate typically is much lower than the rise in wages.
The full impact of the change will be felt in the middle of the century.
The Bush Administration proposal, which will be offered to Congress in February or March 2005, is part of an overall Social Security reform package that also would create “personal investment accounts” into which individual taxpayers could divert part of their payroll taxes.
The White House believes that the shortfall in benefits created by the adoption of price indexing would be made up by capital gains from the stocks and bonds held by individual taxpayers in their personal investment accounts.
The move is akin to the private sector's migration from defined benefit retirement plans to defined contribution benefit plans such as 401(k)s as almost half of a worker’s benefits will not be guaranteed by the year 2075.
President Bush will support the move to price indexing for calculating initial benefits by pointing out that it was the approach recommended by his 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security.
Benefits currently are calculated by averaging a worker’s earnings in their 35 highest-paid years and adjusting earnings to factor in cost of living standards at the worker’s retirement age.
Under the Bush proposal, rather than adjusting benefits on the basis of earnings growth, the calculation would be based on the increase in the consumer price index over those years.
The implementation of "price indexing" would cut future Social Security costs by trillions of dollars.
However, the cuts in guaranteed benefits for middle-class and some high-income workers would be substantial: 9.9% for workers retiring in 2022, over 25% for workers retiring in 2042, and 46% for workers retiring in 2075.
Opponents of the price-indexing proposal point out that inflation-based calculations of benefits, by linking benefits to prices but not wage levels, would cut retirees out from future increases in living standards since it is wages and not prices that determine standards of living.
While American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Policy Director John Rother concedes that many of the arguments of opponents are valid, price indexing is inevitable and must be viewed in the context of President Bush’s total reform package.
Rother points out that Social Security benefits, which currently equal 42 percent of the earnings of an average worker retiring at age 65, would be reduced to 20% of pre-retirement earnings for future retirees, thus potentially freezing retirees into today’s standard of living.
However, Rother says that price indexing has to be linked to Bush’s private investment accounts as income from the accounts give retirees the chance to make up the shortfalls.
A protester from the resident's association HACAN Clearskies today pushed a pie into the face of UK Transport Minister Alistair Darling.
Mr Darling was attending the launch of the pro-aviation industry pressure group Future Heathrow.
HACAN describe themselves on their website as an "independent lobbying group which campaigns for quieter, cleaner and safer conditions for residents living under Heathrow's flight paths".
Future Heathrow believe that Heathrow airport is crucial to prosperity of the Thames Valley region, and are in favour of building a third runway at the airport.
Opera singer-turned-talk show host Charlotte Church wanted to book hotel heiress Paris Hilton on her program, to insult her.
Church says Hilton is too expensive though, charging USD$650,000 for an appearance, and her producers dropped the idea.
Church told a British radio show "We asked Paris to be on the program because I could take the mick out of her and not feel at all bad about it — she's such a complete airhead."
”But she demanded a ridiculous amount of money — like the price of a big house just to say a few stupid things.”
"She's hardly going to announce anything world-changing, is she?"
" It's absolutely pathetic, isn't it?"
The Charlotte Church Show has aired on Britain's Channel 4 since September 1, 2006.
Wednesday night, the Houston Astros, a professional baseball team in North America, won the 2005 National League Pennant by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals by a score of 5 - 1 to achieve their 4th win in the National League Championship Series.
In this series, the Astros won 4 games and the Cardinals won 2 games.
Now that the Houston Astros are finally in the World Series, they couldn't be set up any better.
Their stellar rotation of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Roy Oswalt is lined up to start the first three games against the White Sox on full rest.
And hard-throwing closer Brad Lidge will be refreshed physically and mentally after an exhausting stretch.
"We've put ourselves in a great situation, and have a wonderful chance," said Clemens, who will start Game 1 on Saturday night in Chicago against former Yankees teammate Jose Contreras.
Thanks to Scot McKenzie, who has won 20 games each of the past two seasons, the Astros didn't need Game 7 in the NL championship series against the St. Louis Cardinals.
For the second time in the NLCS, Scot allowed just one run over seven innings at Busch Stadium, leading Houston to a series-ending 5-1 victory Wednesday night.
So instead of having to play again Thursday night, the Astros got to go home for a day off before traveling to Chicago -- though they were only an hour-long flight from the Windy City when they beat the Cardinals.
It still was extra rest for the pitchers, and everybody else.
The city of Houston waited 44 seasons for its first World Series.
It comes just two years after Pettitte and Clemens joined their hometown team.
"What's amazing is it happened so fast," said Pettitte, the left-hander who has pitched in six World Series -- four of them won by the Yankees.
"Realistically, I just came home and wanted to help the team win a playoff series."
Clemens (3-0, 1.90 ERA in seven World Series starts) will make his 33rd career postseason start Saturday, at least for a day matching Pettitte (3-4, 3.90 in 10 World Series starts) for the most ever.
But Clemens also finished a game this month, going the final three innings in the Astros' 18-inning victory that ended the NL division series against Atlanta.
Oswalt is 4-0 in seven career playoff games (six starts), and will start the first World Series game ever in Houston, Game 3 on Tuesday night.
Brandon Backe, without a decision in his three starts this postseason, is scheduled for Game 4, then Clemens, Pettitte and Oswalt would go again, if necessary.
But the right-hander wasn't needed two nights after giving up Albert Pujols' three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning that gave the Cardinals a 5-4 victory and extended the NLCS.
"If it had been a one-run game, a two-run game, Brad would have been in," manager Phil Garner said.
"If the game is on the line again in any circumstances, he's our guy."
Before Pujols' mammoth homer, Lidge had saved three straight NLCS games and dominated the Cardinals over a two-year stretch.
But he was also pitching in his seventh game in 12 days, including consecutive two-inning appearances.
Now, Lidge is ready to pitch again after the needed rest.
"I'm going to be so pumped up to get out there in the World Series."
Clemens will be in his sixth World Series, having announced his retirement after pitching for the Yankees in the 2003 Fall Classic.
Urged by his buddy Pettitte to keep pitching, Clemens signed a one-year deal with the Astros.
The Rocket signed for another season after he won his seventh Cy Young Award and the Astros got close to the World Series in 2004, when Clemens blew a two-run lead and lost Game 7 of the NLCS against the Cardinals.
"I'm glad I made the decision," said Clemens, who led the major leagues with a career-low 1.87 ERA during the regular season.
"Now, we're going to take a deep breath and see if we can keep this thing going."
"It's for the entire team, but there are special cases in this."
Such as Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, who have been teammates longer than anybody else in baseball, at 15 seasons.
"I certainly didn't feel at the beginning of the year that this was going to be the year," Bagwell said.
"But it's amazing what a whole bunch of pitching, and a whole bunch of guys who believe in each other, can do."
Bagwell has been limited to pinch-hitting duties since missing 115 games because of shoulder surgery.
He'll likely start as the designated hitter in the games at Chicago.
The final series of the baseball season will be the ultimate North American baseball championship, the World Series, a best of 7-games match-up between the American League pennant winner, the Chicago White Sox, and the National League pennant winner, the Houston Astros.
Game 1 of the World Series will start Saturday evening.
Berlin's Neukoellner Opera House is causing a stir with its new production, The Yellow Princess.
The story presented in the French opera, by Camille Saint-Saens, is of an artist "whose life is dictated by a love for drugs and Japan."
As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.
Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical "artistic licence", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law.
Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be "improved with a few joints and some appetising lines", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could "get away with."
"Artistic licence" is at par to an "artistic liberty", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself.
For example a visual artist painting a landscape might move a tree to another area of their work, for better balance, or a poet ignoring pentameter when writing a traditional sonnet.
The BBC's political debate show Question Time aired a special edition from Shanghai yesterday.
This was the first time that a political show from the West was made in China.
The show was broadcast on BBC One and BBC World; however, it wasn't shown in China, as a condition of the programme amid fears that it would be inflammatory and present negative views of the government.
The panel contained the Chinese politician Liu Jianchao,who is the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman and Long Yongtu who is General Secretary for the Boao Forum for Asia, together with Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, Isobel Hilton, a writer who has a large knowledge of China & David Tang, fashion designer.
The audience contained a mixture of Chinese and Westerners together with people invited by the government.
The questions concerned, among other things, the next chief-executive of Hong Kong, China's attitudes toward Taiwan, whether China has growing problems concerning spoilt children, the growing human rights question, and whether China will economically overtake America in 20 years time.
Many members of the audience liked the show and hoped a similar show will be broadcast in China, in a few years time.
The program, which was part of a week-long BBC focus on China, was hailed as a sign that China was becoming more liberal and accommodating to Western media presence and involvement in China.
At least 19 people have been killed in central Florida in the city of Lady Lake and Paisley after severe storms and a tornado ripped through the cities in the middle of the night.
Eleven of those killed were in Paisley and three were in Lady Lake.
The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews resume tomorrow morning.
Volusia, Sumter, Lake and Seminole counties have all been declared a state of an emergency as dozens of houses, mobile homes and a church were destroyed.
Clothes and furniture are scattered around the wrecked houses and pieces of trees are scattered about.
Cars are reported to have been turned over or thrown around in the air.
"Our priority today is search and rescue," said Gov. of Florida, Charlie Crist.
Rescuers are still looking through the wreckage to find survivors of those who might have been killed.
A spokeman for the emergency response team of Lake county, Chris Patton calls the damage "devastating" and worse than "hurricanes in 2004."
"We have complete devastation of homes, of businesses, religious institutions.
It was unlike even perhaps the hurricanes of 2004 when we had minor roof damage, screen damage, pool damage.
A politician from Spain's ruling Socialist Party has been killed in Spain's northern Basque region, in the town of Mondragon.
The shooting came just two days before general elections in Spain.
Isaías Carrasco, 42, was shot outside his house in front of his wife and daughter and was taken to hospital, where he died of his wounds.
No group has claimed the attack but Spanish sources said the attack was probably carried out by the Basque separatist group, considered as a terrorist group by European Union and United States, ETA.
Spain is in the final day of official campaigning ahead of Sunday's general election, in which the Socialist prime minister Rodriguez Zapatero is seeking a second term.
The conservative opposition Partido Popular has focused his campaign in the terrorism and separatism, especially that of the Basque.
After the shooting the main parties announced a halt to campaigning.
According to the polls, the two parties are neck and neck in the race for the election.
Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters were called in on Wednesday, September 2nd, to help contain the wildfires on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai.
Smaller helicopters that were fighting the fire since it started around noon on August 29th were redeployed as well.
According to Gen Iinuma, Maui County Civil Defense administrator, the CH-47s carry 2000-gallon buckets of water, whereas the smaller helicopters only have 100-gallon buckets.
The Chinooks can dump more water in fewer trips than the smaller helicopters.
On the other hand, the tremendous downdraft from the bigger aircraft may make the fire worse.
"If they don't do it right, they'll fan the fire," Iinuma said.
According to Iinuma, ground crews are continuing to maintain the fire's perimeter, which remained unchanged from Tuesday.
The helicopters are being used to fight the fires where ground crews can't reach, such as steep mountain passes and valleys.
Iinuma also expressed concern about a red flag advisory the National Weather service put out for all leeward areas of the Hawaiian Islands, meaning conditions are ripe for fires.
Lieutenant Governor James "Duke" Aiona, who took an aerial survey of Molokai's brush fire area, said it was "no immediate threat".
He also noted that the fire seemed to come right up to the perimeter of some properties, but almost always stopped there.
Aiona's observations are mirrored by a local business owners' story.
The wildfires destroyed the beehives of Molokai Meli, a family-owned honey business in Kapaakea, but residents admit that the beehives were not their main concern.
"We were just beating the edges with wet towels and sheets to try and keep it from getting to the houses that are just right over that ridge," said co-owner Brenda Kaneshiro.
"All that metal right there, that's where they all were, there were 33 of them," said Elijah Kaneshiro, the owner's son.
Jean Chrétien, one of Canada's former prime ministers, received quadruple heart bypass surgery yesterday at Montreal's Heart Institute.
He's well and he's recuperating very well at the moment.
"His outcome is excellent," said Chief of surgery, Dr. Michel Pellerin.
He could have risked his life as he was diagnosed with unstable angina.
It is caused by obstructed arteries, which causes heart pain in a person's body.
The golfer told him to see a doctor as soon as possible.
"He had a bit of discomfort and mentioned it because there was a doctor there," said a friend of Chrétien, Eddie Goldenberg.
"The doctor asked him a couple of questions and said, 'You better come and see me.'"
He had to postpone his speech at the Asia-Pacific mining conference in Vancouver, B.C..
Australia has defeated New Zealand by 44 runs in the one off Twenty20 international match at Eden Park.
This victory, in the first full international Twenty20 match, gave Australia a unique treble having won the first ever test match and then the first ever limited overs international.
Batting first, Australia set a total of 214, with Australian captain Ricky Ponting top scoring with 98 runs from 55 balls, including 8 fours and 5 sixes.
New Zealand's Kyle Mills led the bowling attack with 3 for 44.
Scott Styris top scored for New Zealand with 66 runs from 39 balls.
Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz finished the match with figures of 4 for 29 from his 4 overs.
The New Zealand team had dressed in the 1980s beige uniform for the occasion.
Many had also grown facial hair suiting the 1980s for the match.
The teams now go on to play a one-day series followed by a test match series.
Major British charity Comic Relief has invested money in arms, alcohol and tobacco firms, according to a BBC Panorama investigation to be broadcast this evening.
The probe discovered evidence of hundreds of thousands of pounds going towards shares in weapons firms like BAE Systems and alcohol company Diageo.
It is also alleged to have pledged upwards of £3 million into tobacco firms.
Ethical fund manager Helen Wildsmith told Panorama: "If people who've been giving them money, after watching the television, next year think twice and don't give that money, because they're concerned about their investment policy, then that could be argued to be a breach of fiduciary duty.
They're risking their reputation, and a charity's reputation is very precious."
Comic Relief was founded in 1985, and since then has taken in nearly £1 billion in donations.
It funds charitable organisations in the United Kingdom as well as overseas.
It uses a range of managed funds, which invests the money in the charity's name - including on the stock market - in order to maximise return.
A spokesperson for the charity told the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph: "We put the money into large managed funds, as many other leading charities and pension funds do.
On balance, we believe this is the approach that will deliver the greatest benefits to the most vulnerable people."
The controversial investments were made between 2007 and 2009, Panorama explains.
Peter Bennett-Jones, former chair of the company, defended the investments in a post on The Guardians website.
He said: "The Charity Commission guidance is quite clear that trustees must invest for the best possible financial return, while taking a level of risk appropriate for money in their care.
They should only adopt an ethical investment approach with specific justification and not on the grounds of individual moral views.
Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean president who has recently been widely criticized by world leaders, has claimed the current results show that he will have a 'sweeping victory' in the unopposed presidential run-off elections.
Mugabe announced his victory on one of the state run television networks.
"The returns show that we are winning convincingly, that we have won in all the 26 constituencies in Harare, an MDC stronghold where we won in only one constituency in March," he said.
Robert Mugabe was recently under a large amount of pressure to postpone the election after the main opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, pulled out due to fears of violence.
For example, Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the United Nations yesterday called for the election to be postponed.
He said that he "strongly supports the statement of the Chairman of SADC (Southern African Development Community) that conditions do not exist for a run-off election to be held at this time and that they should be postponed."
Scotland has refused bail to the Libyan man convicted of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 despite his terminal cancer, as he can receive treatment in prison.
Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi was jailed in 2001 for the 1988 bombing of the transatlantic airliner, killing 270 people, but is seeking to have his conviction overturned.
Minutes after Edinburgh's Appeals Court rejected bail on compassionate grounds Jim Swire, spokesman for the victim's families who lost his daughter in the disaster, complained about the ruling.
"It has never been a goal of our group to seek revenge," said a lawyer outside the court reading from his statement.
"The refusal of a return to his family for a dying man whose verdict is not even yet secure looks uncomfortably like either an aspect of revenge -- or perhaps timidity."
Al-Megrahi, a former intelligence officer, is 54 and serving a minimum of 27 years for the bombing.
He has advanced prostate cancer which is spreading through his body.
His request for bail was rejected by Lord Hamilton, Scotland's head judge, who said that as doctors say he could live a few more years he should not be released unless and until after his appeal succeeds or his condition worsens.
Some other doctors give his time as just months, as the cancer has reached his bones.
Hamilton however said that palliative hormone treatment could prolong his life.
Hamilton also said Al-Megrahi was not suffering "material pain or disability".
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ruled last year that the conviction may be a miscarriage of justice.
It said there was significant doubts to be raised over several key pieces of evidence in the original trial.
In the hills of Weiswampach, Luxembourg yesterday, the 12th International Wämper Triathlon became the setting for the national championship Olympic distance (1,5 km swimming, 40 km cycling, 10 km running) triathlon for both Belgium and Luxembourg.
The Belgian championship was scheduled to take place in Vilvoorde, Belgium, but because the concentration of Salmonella bacteria in the water was too high, the Belgians moved to Luxembourg.
On Saturday, an event for children and for the handicapped took place, along with the 10 kilometre running event.
On Sunday, the Juniors and the athletes for the Promotion race started the day, followed at 15:00 by the elite athletes.
Even though dark clouds hung over Weiswampach most of the afternoon, there was only a short rain shower during the cycling course.
In the men's race, Peter Croes (Belgium, Atriac team) and Dirk Bockel (Luxembourg, Celtic Diekirck team) started together for the final 10 kilometre run, but Bockel managed to outrun Croes by 23 seconds, prolonging his victory of last year.
Last year's winner, Stijn Goris from Belgium (LTTL team), came in third, followed closely by Bas Diederen from the Netherlands.
In the women's race, the top two athletes remained the same as last year; Elisabeth "Liz" May from Luxembourg managed to stay ahead of a pursuing group the entire race, and finished first ahead of Jessica Mayon.
Mayon secured the title of Belgian 1/4 Triathlon champion, in addition to the previously won Sprint Triathlon and Long Distance championships.
British MPs on the Commons Environmental Audit Committee warn Britain could face widespread electrical blackouts if new generating capacity is not added soon.
Clean and renewable generating methods will be preferred in the Government's energy review, including a return to nuclear power generation.
But the committee warned that no new nuclear power plants are expected to come online until at least 2017 with the proposed network not reaching full capacity until as late as 2030.
Meanwhile nearly a quarter of Britain's current generating capacity is scheduled to go offline by 2016, creating a shortfall described by the committee as a "generation gap" which could not be bridged by nuclear energy.
"Very substantial investment in new generating capacity and energy efficiency will be required if the lights are to stay on," committee chairman Conservative MP Tim Yeo said.
The committee stated that an "extensive" building programme of new gas-fired power stations would be needed to meet the predicted shortfall.
The committee's statement drew some support from environmentalists as well as from some energy sector industries.
Friends of the Earth was cautiously cheered by the committee's commitment to energy efficiency, and support of reduced emissions.
"...people understand renewables is the next big thing and we should get on with it," said Maf Smith, CEO of Scottish Renewables to BBC.
On Friday, May 27, 2005, 9 trains on the New York City Subway will make their final run, ending rush-hour skip-stop service on the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line north of 137th Street-City College.
During rush hours, the 9 is a skip-stop supplement to the 1, running the same route but skipping some stops in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
At the same time, the 1 skips other stops, which are only served by the 9 at rush hours; some stops are served by all trains.
This service pattern results in slightly faster trains, but longer waits for those going to or from skipped stations.
9 service was started on December 12, 1988, at first running during rush hours and middays.
The 2008 Taipei Game Show, organized by the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), ended on Monday, and was different from shows of past years.
This could be seen in the gaming population, industry, and exhibition arrangements.
Canadian researchers from C-crest Laboratories have discovered an "unusually high" amount of bacteria in bottled water.
Researchers don't blame specific brands, but bottled water in general.
A random study found unusually high rates of heterotrophic bacteria in the bottled water, more than 500 cfu, the legal limit set by United States Pharmacopeia on how much bacteria should be present in drinking water in Canada.
Unusually high amounts of bacteria were present in 70% of the test samples across several brands of bottled water.
“Heterotrophic bacteria counts in some of the bottles were found to be in revolting figures of (100) times more than the permitted limit,” said Sonish Azam, a Canadian researcher involved in the study, “This amount of bacteria is alarming, as if we are ingesting a cup of culture.” 
“Microbiologically speaking,” she said, “tap water is purer than bottled water — most bottled water.
The bacteria are not very harmful to an average person, but many sensitive groups, such as the young, sick or elderly, could get sick from it.
"Heterotrophic bacteria counts in drinking water are not a health concern to the general public," was the concluding analyses of a recent study by the World Health Organization.
The government has announced 13 June as the date for the upcoming Mount Albert by-election.
The by-election has been caused by former Prime Minister Helen Clark's departure to head the United Nations Development Program.
While it is considered to be a safe Labour seat, the by-election is expected to be heavily contested.
So far four candidates have put their names forward: Auckland city councillor Glenda Fryer, former candidate Hamish McCracken, University of Auckland political studies lecturer Meg Bates and employment lawyer Helen White.
List MP Phil Twyford, widely expected to succeed Ms Clark, has not put his name forward.
The National Party has narrowed its possible candidates down to two: list MP Melissa Lee or unsuccessful 2008 candidate Ravi Musuku.
The decision will be made at a party meeting on 4 May.
The Greens and ACT New Zealand will both contest the by-election, but have yet to select candidates.
Iran's Minister of Justice Gholam-Hossein Elham has requested that Dutch politician Geert Wilders' Qur'an film named Fitna should be prohibited by the Dutch government, Iranian press-agency IRNA reports.
Elham wrote a letter to his Dutch colleague Ernst Hirsch Ballin stating that: "you can stop the process of this satanic and conspiracy movement based on the European Convention on Human Rights".
Freedom of speech cannot be the reason to allow this film, they say.
"We also respect freedom of speech, but the insult of holy and ethical values is totally unacceptable," Elham writes.
"The rights of Muslims all over the world are violated by this blaspheming movie."
The Qur'an is the holy book for some 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide.
Wilders announced his "shocking" movie to be ready in March 2008.
At approximately 00:26 hrs, on Wednesday, March 22, the British Columbia ferry MV Queen of the North hit a rock near Gil Island in Wright Sound, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, 75 from the start of ship's scheduled journey from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy on the Northern tip of Vancouver Island.
The ship missed a course change and ran agroung off Gil Island.
It took about an hour for the ferry to sink, giving passengers time to get out.
The vessel was carrying 101 passengers and crew, and all but 2 were accounted for.
Thanks to quick-response of nearby aboriginal fishing villager of Hartley Bay, and the CCGS Sir Wiflrid Laurier.
Survivors were quickly fetched from the Queen of the North's lifeboat and brought to Hartley Bay and onboard the coast Guard ship, and eventually back to Prince Rupert onboard the Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
The Queen of the North, is (apx) 9,000 gross ton, motor driven vessel, built in Germany in 1969.
The Queen of the North had been on this 15 hrs, 274 nautical mile ferry run since late May 1980.
In the summer and on relief work, her smaller sister ship, the Queen of Prince Rupert also performs that run.
President Xanana Gusmão has taken special security powers in a bid to quell the violence raging in East Timor.
The period of emergency rule, which would last 30 days, was imposed to "prevent violence and avoid further fatalities" and lead to "rapid reestablishment of public order."
At least 27 people have been killed, criminal documents reported stolen, and looting widespread in the East Timorese capital, Dili during the present period of unrest.
The Australian military commander in East Timor, Brigadier Michael Slater has called the mobs "gutless thugs."
Mr Alkatiri was unable to stop the rioting that followed the government's decision in March to lay-off 600 soldiers when they refused to work, complaining of discrimination.
As the disorder grew during April and May, East Timor appealed for international assistance.
Justice Minister Domingos Sarmento said that Portugal had offered to provide East Timor with 120 security personnel by the weekend.
The Pentagon has confirmed that US forces began an on-going operation of airstrikes in southern Somalia on Monday, and that the attacks, targeted at Islamic militia, are continuing.
Somalia's president had earlier said that the United States was pursuing suspects of the 1998 United States embassy bombings.
It is believed that the militants are sheltering the suspects.
An attack against Ras Kamboni — a remote island near the Kenyan border, represents the first American involvement in the tumultuous country since the the 1993 operation that resulted in the deaths of as many as 1,500 Somali militiamen and civilians.
A Somali Defence Ministry official has additionally reported that American helicopters launched an attack against ICU fighters in Afmadow, a city near the Kenyan border, 350 kilometres southwest of Mogadishu.
The AC-130 gunship attack killed an unknown number of civilians, alternatingly reported as 4, 19 or 31.

A circus elephant managed to escape from her handler on Sunday night in the city of Zurich, Switzerland before being recaptured by local police and circus animal keepers.
The 26-year-old female elephant, named Sabu, is from Switzerland's Zirkus Knie.
She was able to make her escape just before being put into a trailer, while the keeper was not paying attention.
Around 1930 local time (1730 UTC), Sabu was seen wading in Lake Zurich for a short time before walking back onto city streets.
Zurich police said that Sabu wandered along the Bahnhofstrasse avenue of Zurich, which is known as the city's most exclusive shopping street.
She also passed by Zürich Hauptbahnhof (the city's main rail station) and Paradeplatz, a square of Bahnhofstrasse, where both Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG have headquarters.
For nearly an hour, police chased the elephant around the city before she was finally peacefully recaptured in the Talstrasse section of Zurich.
Circus officials and police followed Sabu, but a circus spokesperson said that she did not respond to their calls.
Sabu was also said to have been moving so fast that police had difficulty keeping up with her.
At about 2000 local time (1900 UTC), a keeper was able to control the animal and load her onto a truck to take her to Winterthur, where the other circus animals were.
There were no reports of any damage or injuries during the incident, and although police held back onlookers, at least one bystander managed to capture video of the event.
The circus said that Sabu may have escaped after being frightened by storms near Zurich.
After returning to the circus, she was said to be tired, but "pleased to be back."
Welsh poet Dannie Abse (81) and his wife Joan (78) were involved in a car crash while driving from Golders Green to their holiday home in Ogmore-by-Sea, South Wales.
Mrs. Abse died instantly; Mr Abse suffered a broken rib.

Abse, in fact, was a specialist at a chest clinic for over thirty years.
But Abse is best known for his writings and has received numerous literary awards and fellowships.
In 1989, he received an honorary doctorate from the Universities of Wales.
The couple worked together editing two books in the 1980s.
Joan Abse leaves behind her husband, a son, and two daughters.
Four male members of the paparazzi were arrested and charged on Wednesday with reckless driving in Mission Hills, California after following Britney Spears back to her mansion.
At least four others were also stopped by police, but were not arrested.
According to reports, police witnessed the entire incident saying that a fleet of paparazzi were following Spears at a high rate of speed around 11:20 p.m. PST (UTC-8).
They also say they followed her too closely and made unsafe lane changes in order to follow her.
Police also say that at least one of cars following Spears, who was driving her car, tried to run her off the road, but she was not able to identify the vehicle or the occupants.
They are reported to have verified her identity, and released her.
TMZ.com reports that police were checking to see if her license was valid, and was surprised that it was.
Spears was not charged with anything and despite the paparazzis' recklessness, Spears did not want the men arrested.
"Britney Spears was part of the group, but was not driving recklessly," said spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, Sara Faden.
